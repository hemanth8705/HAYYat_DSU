Starlink satellites, launched by Elon MuskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SpaceX, are causing issues for astronomers. A new study, published Wednesday in Astronomy & Astrophysics, highlights the growing problem. The network, comprising over 6,300 satellites, delivers high-speed internet to remote locations. However, it also generates unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR), disrupting radio astronomy.Why Radio Astronomy MattersRadio astronomy focuses on studying space at radio frequencies. Unlike optical telescopes, which detect visible light, radio telescopes capture radio waves from space. Just like bright lights can overwhelm human eyes, UEMR from satellites can blind radio telescopes. Cees Bassa, from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, explains the impact. Observing near a satellite is like spotting a faint star next to a full moon. Read Also:Ã‚Â Earth set to welcome a new mini-moon on September 29; key details revealed Benjamin Winkel, from the Max Planck Institute, elaborates further. Ã¢â‚¬Å›ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blinding,Ã¢â‚¬Å¥ Winkel states. Radio telescopes become saturated with UEMR, much like eyes overloaded with light.Second-Generation Satellites Worsen the SituationThe study reveals that Starlink's newer satellites, less than a third of the fleet, emit 32 times more UEMR than the older ones. This problem exists despite SpaceX trying to reduce UEMR in its first-generation satellites. Winkel notes that while some improvements were made to earlier models, the new ones are significantly brighter. With satellite launches becoming more affordable, the issue could worsen. Estimates suggest up to 100,000 satellites may orbit Earth by 2030. In June 2023, UNOOSA estimated there were 11,330 satellites in orbit. Read Also:Ã‚Â Sunita Williams, stuck in space for months, takes command of the ISS once again as NASA prepares a rescue missionThe Need for RegulationExperts believe regulations for satellite emissions are essential. Current ground-based electronics, like cellphone towers, have limits on radio pollution. The same should apply to satellites. Winkel explains that while leaks are inevitable, the amount needs strict control. Currently, astronomers rely on goodwill agreements with companies like Starlink to manage satellite interference. Regulations, however, could provide more consistent protection. This rising interference signals the need for tighter control as the satellite population grows.\n",
