1,9ItvwqiehD0,Faster internet connection is the coverup and sales pitch. They will be used for global surveillance in a AI lead cashless society. Sone they will introduce microchip implants for humans which will become mandatory
2,9ItvwqiehD0,I HATE clickbait titles.  8 minutes and I still don‚Äôt know how the satellites are deployed.  üëé
3,9ItvwqiehD0,So they will become militarized
4,9ItvwqiehD0,But if the weather is bad so will be your internet
5,9ItvwqiehD0,Satellites should be built with a self destruct feature that destroys said satellite
6,9ItvwqiehD0,That's the go lol trash the earth then start trashing the sky's lol
7,9ItvwqiehD0,Terrible title    Wasted 9 minutes
8,9ItvwqiehD0,The title is misleading. The video did not talk about How Starlink Satellites Are Deployed. Therefore it earned a dislike.
9,9ItvwqiehD0,actually it's superb to watch satellites cross the night sky when looking at the stars.
10,9ItvwqiehD0,Can you say Balloons?
11,9ItvwqiehD0,I have seen one of these  satellite trains I flew over head and starting glitching in and out one second ist there the next it fades out. Comes back on and so on for a bit then just disappears. Did not look real at all it looked like a halo Gram glitching in and out. 9 lights in the sky with one brighter light out front. Fakest shit I have seen in a while

19,9ItvwqiehD0,"Starlink has generated significant interest and excitement in the tech and internet connectivity communities. Its promise of providing high-speed internet access to remote and underserved areas is seen as a potential game-changer, especially for regions with limited access to traditional broadband options. Is it TRUE?"
20,9ItvwqiehD0,"Yes, I‚Äôm finally being able to communicate with my family who lives in the middle of the Amazon jungle and couldn‚Äôt have internet until they installed Starlink last week.

Personally: I think  Eddie  is crazy. All he did was consult, one time, during a lunch."

54,9ItvwqiehD0,"Firstly. You wont be able to see thousands of moving dots everywhere. The satellites are small compared to the amount of space in space, you can also only really spot the satellites when they are released into orbit, they tumble / rotate initially to spread them apart, this causes light to reflect off them in all kinds of directions but it is only temporary, once positioned and in the correct orientation their black underside makes them completely invisible to the naked eye
Secondly, the satellites dishes or antenna arrays used by starlink are So small compared to satellites used in the past. You think in the future houses will be ugly because of satelite dishes?? Seriously? Ever heard of satelite tv? It's a thing and it has existed for years. You have probably seen tons of satelite dishes in your lifetime but never paid them any attention.."

61,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@_A4A There is no such thing as analog internet. Everybodies connection to it is digital. Even when people were using dial up connections. Modems modulated the digital signals so they could be carried by an analog line, it was still digital data.

Define ridiculously sized? Have you actually seen the size of the dishes used by Starlink? I think you may be imaging the older dishes people used back in the 1970s and 1980s that used C band for analog sat TV and were commonly referred to as BUDs (Big Ugly Dishes). Starlink dishes are smaller than even many of the Ku band dishes used for the digital sat TV services like Dish Network and Direct TV. Do you currently complain about all the existing antennas everywhere? You are surrounded by them if you pay attention. Shortwave broadcast, AM and FM broadcast, TV broadcast, emergency service repeaters, ham radio antennas including repeater towers, cell phone transceiver towers, TV Shortwave AM and FM reception antennas, private radio network antennas for companies communicating with and tracking vehicles, wifi antennas, and more both large and small. 

Yes, there are a lot of studies on problems with space debris orbiting the Earth but none of that applies in the long term to anything considered to be in Low Earth Orbit. Anything in that region still experiences drag from the outer edges of the atmosphere and without thrusters reboosting to gain altitude it will slowly encounter more and more drag, slow down, fully reenter the atmosphere, and burn up during reentry. So even if the entire company were to vanish overnight the sat would eventually quite literally fall out of the sky and destroy themselves rather than remaining in orbit and becoming navigational hazards. To put it in perspective the ISS orbits at an altitude of 254 miles above the surface while Starlink sats only orbit at max altitude of 350 miles. If one completely fails the estimate is it would deorbit in around 5 years. In other words. They are by design using an orbit where if nobody keeps telling them to use their thrusters occasionally to maintain altitude they will self destruct and leave nothing behind to be a problem for anybody."

64,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@hackerx7329 I appreciate you for taking the time and thoroughness to explain in detail about the satellites and their functions thereof.  Also the different scenarios and examples of what could or should happen.  I also appreciate you for pointing out different factors as well.  I'm still not a big fan of Man filling up our worlds orbit with potential hazards as some things have reentered our atmosphere and did not fully burn up, as China has twice now been called out for and luckily that debris landed in the indian ocean, but had the whole world on notice.

Nonetheless, I do hope for a better & safer world for us younger generations that are still growing up, going to start our own family's and so on, and what world we leave behind.  I had to laugh at the acronym ""BUD"" because my Grandfather had one of those and so did a lot of his neighbors and they are Butt Ugly Dishes and he was always having issues with it. ü§£

Which is decoded and every handset built in the last decade. To create a worldwide party line of text messages that's broadcast. Where the uplink is enter is interception of the cell phone tower transmissions. Which come booming out of their antennas. So loud that they are readable far beyond low earth orbit where the starlinks are. So modify the next generation of starlinks to also listen to those frequencies, and then broadcast down the L2C frequency, using a coding that's not interfering. Granted some will complain but if it's not interfering. Just a slight increase in the noise floor. A basketball team, gribbling and passing the ball until every player has touched the ball at least once. Where the first text sender, is assured delivery everywhere once It sees its message in the L2C it receives. Neither latency or bandwidth guaranteed. Just assurance of delivering. Will support every social network application, as all were born on a text message fabric. And still have that code embedded for legacy support. The handset takes the message, stores it in its internal database. Where unique It passes it on up the text message stack to all users. Where the internal text message database will contain, weeks if not years of from,-tos in relative time order. With payloads in the clear for apps that need to be compatible. With their first instantiations a decade ago. Good news is, delivery is assured to The world's population and their handsets. Bad news, the police and government lose their ability to absolutely censor. Other than perhaps as mandated antivirus filtering services. Use by government to censor, and others to limit children or employees access to things they should not hear or see. The police and governments, need to suck it up, what they lose is more than made up for visibility of all from to in relative time, gumshoe work possible by all. Where privacy as always and discrimination rules have to be enforced by human systems like the courts. Or the family buys the bullets, of those who speak politically incorrectly. The only security at the from to level that exist is operational security. Use it or lose it. One reason For a CEO to step aside. Is he now knows how to compete with himself and As CEO it would be up pure conflict of interest to remain.

The other nice feature about a party line text message service, which some of the existing services already claimed to be. But they forget that a let's connect every but one to everything. Only works if everyone can hear. And only the receiver can choose what to block, or use the equivalent of an antivirus package that they trust to filter what they can hear.

143,qs2QcycggWU,"""FAQ: Q1)  Do the two phase shifts from beam steering and 64QAM mess each other up?"" they do not mess up due to different frequencies, not due to the different amounts/locations of patches of excitation (it is more amplitude and frequency modulation rather than amplitude and phase modulation, on top of this they can be polarization modulated since they possess two perpendicular linear polarizing transmitters)."

258,qs2QcycggWU,"I love when people have the English subtitles for people who don‚Äôt understand what is said or mishear things, and then use (Canadian, American, Australian) for additional commentary, jokes, the same thing said with local jargon, etc."
259,qs2QcycggWU,"i see all those comments where people say they are some radio engineers or have physics degree, well i never even went to college, yet all this is just common sense to me. i understand all of it just fine. in fact this is pretty much how i visualize things in my head when signal is being sent.

for example when i use USB wifi adapter (which is different, i know, but similar), i can visualize how the signal works and where it goes/comes from. i have lot of wifi stuff, including grid antenna, large 2.4ghz antenna (about 1m in size) and bunch of smaller omni-directional and directional antennas. 
i always wondered why beamforming isn't used in smaller wireless antennas, but i guess it's because they wouldn't know where the station is.
i wonder if it would be viable. like if you're using a hotspot or friend's internet and know the exact location of wifi station or if you have GPS on laptop and walk around the approximate location of station, then based on wifi strenght you can use program like wifi hopper to pinpoint the exact location based on GPS and signal strenght. then beamforming would be viable as you only have to point the antenna in generic direction.

btw longest wifi (2.4ghz) link was about 500km by using regular directional antennas. they simply attached them to both ends and based on google maps, pointed them towards eachother. that's quite insane to think that this was done ON EARTH."

261,qs2QcycggWU,"What I think is cool about the 3D animation model you're working with is it is a cumulative progression. All of what you made in the past, a lot of it can be re-used or adapted to projects in the future. This is a rare sight so see so thoroughly and correctly taken advantage of. That leaves the artists more time, over time, to make the show and need less time building its parts. The consistent style you settled on is good and the libraries of assets more and more useful every show you make. Using that paradigm is quite literally the only way this series can be economical. 3D animation takes a LOT of time and any way you can scrape efficiency into a workflow, the less arduous it is for everyone involved. The first several years of production are much much harder than any years after that, as long as you stay meticulously organized and only make new assets as you need to for a particular subject. Well done."

3/4 cup powdered milk
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter (or margarine)
1/4 cup evaporated milk
1 piece egg
1/2 cup sesame seeds
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, add the all purpose flour, powdered milk and baking powder. Combine and mix well.

2. In another bowl, combine the sugar, evaporated milk, melted butter and egg. Mix until well combined.

3. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Mix until well combined. Knead for a few minutes until smooth and sticky.

4. Grab a small portion of the mixture and then roll into a ball. Then, coat them with sesame seeds. 

5. When fully covered by sesame seeds, roll them again in your palm to make sure that the seeds will not fall. 

Do these steps with the rest of the ingredients.

Heat a lot of oil in a pan. 
Deep fry the binangkal balls until golden brown. 
Transfer them to a strainer or paper towel to drain excess oil.
Transfer the binangkal to a serving plate.

400,qs2QcycggWU,Hello! Really congratulations for the video! I have a question. I did not understand how the signal can be modulated by phase if the phase is used to direct the signal towards the satellite.
401,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, what a time to be alive!"
402,qs2QcycggWU,This was a super cool video. Really enjoyed the nerdy details. The beam steering was particularly interesting.

408,qs2QcycggWU,"The aiming of individual antennas via phase shifting is nutty, think programing for each node with respect to its ~1,200 neighboring nodes on the dish to constantly alter their frequency (very small room for error). 

Then there's the whole aiming in the direction of something 100s of kilometers away every ~4 min & ü§Ø."

452,qs2QcycggWU,I am curious how starlink works under rain?
453,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, I am a student from Bangladesh.  The students there are in a very bad situation for some time.  1000+ students were killed because they spoke for their rights.  You can see the news about the brutal attack on the students.  It was all a pre-planned and political attack.  But when the students started protesting for their rights, and the government failed to prevent it, all the servers of the network were shut down in the whole country, so that the news would not spread among people or other countries.  All sim networks and broadband were off for about 6 days.  During those 6 days students were killed continuously.   So we just want a stable network connection that will always stay connected in any situation. Please Inform us if you can cooperate.  Then we will be obstructed to you. 
Thank you."
454,qs2QcycggWU,So where does the content for the satellites come from to beam down to our Starlink dishes?
455,qs2QcycggWU,"There's a base station on earth that the satellites in space connect to. In other words, when you download a file, for instance, your download comes from the server and gets sent to the base station's network. Then it gets beamed up to space to the satellite. Then, it gets beamed down to Earth to your Starlink dish and then sent to your computer. The process happens in reverse when you send data from your computer, say a voice call."
456,qs2QcycggWU,"This tech is right on time! Thank you for the research, I hungry for more. Elon is giving us what we need ‚ù§"

The goal of providing deep powerful and durable communication pathways to support this amazing platform is daunting and the effort of the smartest savants and genius minds from so many divisions of science leave only a strange sense of wonder that cannot be described but only felt by the onlooking participant in this masterful system of operation.  All the economics and industry and orbital pathway coordinates held tightly...I am left to a mentAl flat spin of sorts that leave me praying to God for all the souls that wish not for short latency but perhaps a meal or a blanket as they lay without either under these same satellites .  Elon, his dreams, and technology all coordinated to provide function with respect to the challenges science has engaged with the brilliant design, development and  operation of the satellite system.

Some things I would be more curious about is what is the signal drop rate when transferring to and back from the satellite and how different types of weather might affect the reliability. 

Also whether are any connection states that are kept on the satellites and if so how  might they be transferred to the other satellite in the range of dishy?"

541,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks a lot for this great work & vulgarization , mind blowingüëç"
542,qs2QcycggWU,What??
543,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video as I was not aware of Starlink's operating characteristics. I assumed OFDM as in orthogonal frequency division. The 64 QAM modulation provides 6 bits per frequency per symbol period, which is not bad for communicating 500 miles away, and also with all the other effects that must be factored in like doppler and the need for channel frequency correction. In cell phones and WiFi we now in 5G/6G go up to 1024 and even 4096 instead of 64 QAM, more bits per symbol but they only have to transit a few kilometers or a few feet in the case of WiFI.  The finer the constellation the grid the more you need a good channel condition. The error vector magnitude which is the noise component must be small or errors come into play.  One additional thing that could be mentioned is there is a need for reference signals, which along with the data symbol have a known amplitude ( 1 ), and a determined phase. When detected the reference signal allows us to rotate the  signal received and scale them to get a good grid on which we can detect what the value transmitted is. Another thing not mentioned is forward error correction. We add many more bits to the transmitted signal and are able to figure out which bits were not received correctly and correct them. I am sure there are control channels, probably a random access channel to gain the satellites attention. Great video, keep them coming."

585,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks sir
586,qs2QcycggWU,"super explanation, thanks"
587,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, how interesting, indeed mind blowing.  Just for my understanding, that aiming of the beam can only be achieved by the sending antenna? So when de satellite sends to Dishy, Dishy receives with an undirected antenna but then the satellite antenne aims the signal at Dishy? Although there are more than one Dishy on the ground the Satellite has to aim a beam simultaneously at many Dishys...  And the other thing not covered in this video, when one satellite goes out of site, Dishy has to switch to another satellite to keep the internet connection up and running. So this re-aiming the beam must be done very quickly... Unbelievable this all, but it works.
I juist thought of another question. The satelliet communicates with a groundstation. However it will be in radio contact also only for about 2 minutes, so do the Starlink satellites communicatie amongst each other to relay the internet link? Or how does that work?"
588,qs2QcycggWU,If I had the chance I would put starling in every home around the world. In that good of sales guy

Even for me who had limited English ability knew how it work...
I lived in a remote village at West Borneo province, Indonesia...

For seeking internet signal we must walk up hills and looking for a few internet signal spots....
Due to my economy condition,I can buy it....

Even I can saving my money(and my family will eat grassüòÅüòÅüòÅ),I still can't buy it....
In Indonesia you must use credit card in Starlink transaction and pay it monthly bill....

601,qs2QcycggWU,How can they communicate with pole coordinates without changing the direction of the beam? They both use fase shifting. Why doesn't the consructive interference (and so the direction of the beam) change when a signal with an other fase has to be send?

646,qs2QcycggWU,"Hmm, in only to 3:20 or so and you're going to tell me that Starlink coverage in non-existent over the poles? Is that some Classified crap?

Okay, FYI, phased array antennae and their capabilities have been around for a very long time. Only because of computing speeds has it become more of a danger/help. Make not mistake, your data/comm is being kept and may be evaluated for some reason.

At 21:51 they're talking about comm capabilities that would have been on Malaysia Flight 370. Why can't they tell us where/when those capabilities ceased to exist. Not to mention the Rolls Royce engines that continually talk back to the mother ship in Europe. 

Overall, this is a very well done teaching aid! I could only wish to be able to present such information in, what actually is, seventh grade science in my estimation."
647,qs2QcycggWU,"If the module can steer the beam in a wide array of directions without moving the motors, then why do the motors move the platform normally to the satellite when the system is powered on? To start with a stronger baseline signal before steering the beam as minor adjustments during the day?
We use one of these systems for work and I had no idea of the complexity of this system. Thanks for making another great video! Wish more channels produced content of this quality."

794,qs2QcycggWU,U said we need to be a multidisciplinary student. And yes and u have achieve that. The problem is when u want to make something lucrative or creative u need money. And that stop u from being like Elon musk. The journey of him is fantastic. So are u blessed with all this knowledge without contributing to the real world or u just want to spread this knowledge generously and let people take their course in it and whoever have that power money can do something about it later. There's no one in entire world who can make use of this wide range of knowledge without some restraint from the people itself or the government. I just hope we can make do with this knowledge and make human realise more in emerging technology rather than the war itself. Thank you but no thank you

830,qs2QcycggWU,"I spent months researching phased array antennas and their functionality. At last, I discovered one of the finest videos on the subject available online!"
831,qs2QcycggWU,Do you see the irony of this. The same guy who wants to go to Mars will be responsible for launches into space being impossible. It's not the satellite it's the number of satelites in low earth orbit travelling at  27000km per hour. Starlinks' goal is something like 45k satelites with a life expectancy of 4 years. So constant replacements will need to be launched. This will make it almost impossible to escape earth without crashing into a starlink satelite. Critical thinking is not cynicism.
832,qs2QcycggWU,"There are no satellites in the world. They are fooled by satellites and they only use old technology which is only updated, such as the original White Alice, which reflects the signal back to the ground via a satellite dish."

890,qs2QcycggWU,"1. how does one satellite communicate with multiple dishies at the same time? what is the maximum number of dishes one satellite can communicate with?

2. why do they use same anntenas to send and receive? would have been much cooler if the dishy can simultaniously send and receive

P.S. awesome video, I think you can also make an amazing video about how each satellite communicate with others, how  SpaceX chooses the positions of this satellite, how are they maintained..."

2. How do these powerful electromagnetic waves interact/interfere with humans on the biological cellular level? 
3. With so many satellites up there, and with aircraft being closer to the satellites, does this increase the chances of airplane pilots or someone standing in the path of the beam increase the chances of  getting cancer?
4. The disheys have a slight sound to them. Can you please explain what this sound is?

931,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the comprehensive and mindblowing animation!
932,qs2QcycggWU,"So, when I understand that correct: The position of the Starlink satellites are programmed into the firmware of the dish, consequently I can only use the satellites that are programmed into the firmware. In order to use new satellites as Starlink launches new ones, it's very important to upgrade the Firmware frequently otherwise I can't use them, right?

Further, if old satellites die because they only have a life span of 5 yeas, but the firmware on the dish don't know that because of an old firmware, the Dish will try to connect to a dead satellite?"

990,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a radio engineer. I just want to say....Waw, explaining beam forming using massive antenna array ! That is very hard thing to do but you had the simplest and clearest explanation that I have ever seen!"
991,qs2QcycggWU,"Back in 2006, I used to develop similar antenna 4x8 (feeding network, patch antenna) for Inmarsat system  for my MSc work at Wroclaw University of Technology. It used to work for L1-band (GPS). 

What impressed me in this video was, how they easily explained the beam forming and shifting principles.  They also mentioned about the side lobes, to complete the topic. What I have missed here (what IMHO is also very exciting) is the technique to achieve the circular polarization (just by adding  90 or 180 deg phase shifter beetween feed lines).  Anyway, great work.

Btw, the concept of array antenna with electronically controlled lobe is principle of modern radar systems ..."
992,qs2QcycggWU,"i never even went to college, yet i understood this before i even watched the video. to me, it's all common sense.
i only watched this to confirm what i already knew, there were few minor details i didn't expect, but basically i knew the concept.
i remember someone once thought that antenna is suppose to constantly move and said his antenna is broken because it doesn't constantly turn... DUH."
993,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!
994,qs2QcycggWU,The F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet's radar is equipped with an array of antennas. Its beam is limited to 80 nm (150 km). The antenna cannot track 1 million objects. But the satellite can track zillions of antennas on the earth?

This was a Marketing video to get a bunch of new recruits to sign up. Stick to your course work and design antenna of various flavors, learn as much as you can in your RF course work. And, learn more on cube satellites and don't forget you'll have to learn more of software defined satelites. You will need to read up on SCA Software Communications Architecture, then you might be able to get past this Markeing bait of a Trump like University."

1016,qs2QcycggWU,"Question: One of the complaints I've heard about dishy is the power draw being around 100W - quite high if you're remote or powering from batteries. As the video showed, the more antenna the greater the power of the beam coming from dishy due to constructive interference. As manufacturing techniques improve is it conceivable that you could get the same beam power by increasing the density of antennas and reducing the power/amplitude of the wave signals fed to them so that the total power draw is reduced?"

1022,qs2QcycggWU,"i Have had Starlink installed for a year now. It suddenly stops working.  I go on my app & do all the troubleshooting. I suspect the router & put in a report stating I suddenly don't have internet.  You have to do this online even though your internet is down.  I get a response with a copy past saying ""Your Starlink hardware appears healthy upon initial review. There are no major alerts or setup issues that have been identified that would impact your speeds.

From the network side, you may experience varying or slower speeds during peak hours of network usage. Peak hours are the times during the day when many Starlink users are trying to use their service at the same time, which is typically in the evening. This is more common in densely populated regions. You may notice this more particularly when streaming or playing games.

As Starlink continues to launch satellites and build out our ground network, your service will continue to improve. Engineers are dedicated to improving the our network capabilities across the globe and optimize performance.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please respond to this ticket""   I responded with saying I had no internet & I think is the modem. long story short I went into town & bought a new system. Bought it home plugged in the new router & instant internet. still no response from ""help"" not happy with the level of ""service"""

1042,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a bit long, but, hopefully I can help someone.

We recently installed StarLink and it has blown us away!  Our other satellite company provided us with approx.  2.5 mbps Upload and 7 to 12 mbps [clear night} download.
According to a few sites a speed of 5 Mbps is a good upload speed, an 10 Mbps.  When we installed StarLink, right after they finished installing all the satellites in North America,
within 5 minutes of turning on the router:

Device to Router: Download 724 Mbps        Lowest Speed Test:  Download 69 Mbps          
                                  Upload 333 Mbps                                                 Upload 49 Mbps
                                 

Router to Internet:  Download 166 Mbps      Lowest Speed Test:   Download 104 Mbps  
                                    Upload 19.4  Mbps                                                Upload 13 Mbps  


These numbers have fluctuated, depending on day and time, also cloudy, storms, etc.

YES, the equipment is pricey compared to free install for the other providers AND the monthly $120.00 is about $45.00 more than the price of our last provider, BUT, so what!!!!
StarLink is WORTH IT, if you have fiber optic, I do not see why you would need StarLink.  Fiber Optic is more consistent, HOWEVER, if you live in a rural area WITHOUT Fiber Optic,
StarLink is really the BEST OPTION, If you use the internet a lot.  

StarLink is always upgrading, so it will only get better from here, and possibly a bit more pricey.

My advice, if you use the internet for email and browsing, pretty much any satellite provider is OK.  Our neighbors are in the 80s, and they are very satisfied with what they have.  BUT, if you work online, game, watch movies, etc., ditch the other satellite providers and get StarLink, you will not regret it!  

Oh, the install was a bit rough, but that was because of our roof and it being higher than I can get to. Had to install it against our fascia, and lower than I wanted {but free of obstructions.}

{DANG, SpaceX should pay me for this OR I may charge for install consulting, hmmmm, lol!}"

1060,qs2QcycggWU,"Anything I‚Äôd say would just be a repeat of what they said. In short form. That was amazing. Question, where do base stations fit in to the system."
1061,qs2QcycggWU,"Superb Job, congrats. I would say that for the user terminal  CPU needs here a FPGA(or even ASIC) , not displayed in the video. Why? Because for the real-time, high-speed signal processing required for beamforming and tracking satellites the CPU is not suitable at all. So CPU should manage network functions, user interaction, and system controls.  So what i guess is that the chip you mention that calculates the phase angles for the beamformers, part of a digital signal processing (DSP) system, is fact either an fpga or an ASIC and doesnt run therefore any software, because is already configured in hw."
1062,qs2QcycggWU,I love this
1063,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for this awesome explanation.  Question, your video implies that the satellite focuses the beam to a single dishy. I doubt this is true. Could you explain or pick up in a future video how the satellite is able to send unique content to 1000s or more dishys at one time?"

1099,qs2QcycggWU,"According to Musk, Dishy doesn't know anything about the satellites in orbit. That's why it sits flat at first. It waits and listens for a satellite to talk to. I'm not even certain it knows what satellite will appear next. I think it just listens for a new one."

1103,qs2QcycggWU,2ms to send packets to the satellite WTF????!!!!!! thats impossible wtffff
1104,qs2QcycggWU,but what about the time from the big main ground satellites to the servers like amazon or google would that be different than normal isp with fiber cables or just the same once the data reaches those satellites it switches to ground connection with fiber and no longer uses satellites?

1121,qs2QcycggWU,It's a shame Starlink can't give me the winning Lottery numbers before the actual drawing happens ! üòÇ
1122,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question!

In the English (Canada) subtitles around three minutes, the notes mention a set up for satellite internet on a cruise ship. My question is, why is the geostationary dome and motor set up necessary? 

If I'm understanding the video correctly, the phase beam can shift using the coordinates and movement of the satellite, is it unable to factor in the coordinates of the cruise ship in those calculations as well and shift the beam accordingly? Or have cruise ships not adopted the starlink ""dishy"" and instead using traditional stationary satellites that don't have that capability? 

I hope this question makes sense, its pretty high level engineering/physics/math for someone who studies humanities in college! Thanks again for this awesome video. Learning about the space sciences are my hobby so I love highly detailed videos like these."

FAQ: Q1)  Do the two phase shifts from beam steering and 64QAM mess each other up?  A: No.  For transmission, the data is encoded into the 64QAM signal and sent to all the beamformers where then the beam steering phase shift is added.  Then the signal is sent to the front-end modules which increases the power for the patch antennas."

1153,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink

1. There are no satelittes in 550 km Orbit.
There is no Orbit because the earth is not a globe (Buch von 1881  Samuel Rowbotham earth not a globe). Its flat.

2. Rockets do not work in vacuum. Can't.

1161,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blown. Amazing explanations, this is by far my favourite Science channel . Your quality in explanation and visuals are unmatched. Please make many more videos like this.

A few ideas:
 How does an electric engine work, maybe with reference to servo motors?

How does induction work in reference to ovens and induction charging( phones)
?

Maybe a video on some sensors, like electric thermometers, seizmic sensors, geiger counter, radios(basically covered in this video), movement sensors etc.

Maybe some material science would be cool, like next gen conductors etc.


Also nuclear reactors, fusion reactors stuff like that would be awesome.

1183,qs2QcycggWU,Is the satellite only communicating with one dishy at a time? If it‚Äôs communicating with multiple dishy‚Äôs how does it not ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù the different information each dishy ‚Äúwants‚Äù?
1184,qs2QcycggWU,When I watch this on 1.25x and return on normal it felt slower yeah it slower but its fels more slow befor i change the sped to 1.25x
1185,qs2QcycggWU,I have no words to describe the quality and the depth of knowledge that this video provides! I wish I had such a source of material during my graduation.
1186,qs2QcycggWU,Where can I find the creators comments?
1187,qs2QcycggWU,14:50 I need a source to deep dive this. Can't find anything that would confirm such incredible gain. From my experience it should be less than 1280.
1188,qs2QcycggWU,I really wish there was a document with all the text from the canadian subtitles. It is so inconvenient to read.

I connect a eithernet cord and another router I fix packet loss, lagg, distance and the constant data use from apps like Facebook. I was a field technician for exceed internet. Number 2 in the nation for overall customer satisfaction and quality of work. 1 company owns ground to satellite internet(viasat, wild blue, exceed, hues net, dish network, all the same). 1 company owns ground to substation to satellite (Verizon, comcast, spectrum, firefly, all the same). Starlink is then the conventional service. They used radio waves and made the ""substation"" built into dishy, then moved the whole system alot closer."

1240,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a former engineer who designed mobile phones in Japan. The same passive phased array antenna is used in the AWS SPY-1 radar of the Aegis warship owned by countries such as the United States and Japan. Recently, flat antennas have also been sold for terrestrial television reception.
Digital transmission technologies include binary BPSK, 4-value QPSK, and 64QAM, which adds not only phase but also amplitude, and 256QAM for terrestrial Wi-FI and 5G communications, but if communication conditions are poor, 64QAM is used. It will fall. Maybe 64QAM is the most practical with current technology?
By the way, there is one thing that bothers me. This is a very detailed question, but why are broadcasting and communication satellites orbiting 36,000 km above the equator flying in the opposite direction to the Earth's rotation? It cannot be a geostationary satellite unless it rotates in the same direction and at the same speed as the Earth's rotation. No, I was just a little concerned...

The goal is 40,000 satellites in the strings in low earth orbit that will need to be replaced in 4 to 5 years creating a massive ""junk belt"" of defunct equipment falsely claimed to be self-cleaning...
The claim is that they will de-orbit on their own and solve that conundrum, but the ones that died prematurely are still 'stuck' in orbit...thereby proving false that claim...
It has neen projected that at some point in the near future, it will be too dangerous to send a launch vehicle up in space because of the inevitable damage a collision will cause...

What a childish perspective. We need quality teachers to help instruct those who are out there doing. If you actually believe what you just said, you probably have some growing up to do. How dare you insult educators. I‚Äôve had more than a few teachers in grade school and professors in college help shape my career trajectory. Maybe it‚Äôs time to take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need to be a piece of chit to feel better about myself?‚Äù"
1411,qs2QcycggWU,"why does everyone needs some degree to understand this? i never even went to college, yet all of this is common sense to me.
i've understood beamforming since i was like 6-8 years old maybe. i would have used exact same explanation as him bringing ocean waves as example. it's so easy to understand, this doesn't only work with radiowaves, but with everything else aswell. things cancel / push eachother around in entire universe.

i always say that in order to make something, you just have to understand how universe works. once you understand basics how particles move, you can manipulate them.

most fascinating thing to me, is how all this fits together. i understand the entire process and i can explain it, but if i'd have to build it out of scratch, not so sure if i could do it. it would take me years of testing."
1412,qs2QcycggWU,amazing stuff. Mankind can be so smart. But unfortunately also infinite dumb

1419,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink must use 1 antennas with 10 types of small rabbit antennas from 20 ghz to 120 ghz to improve the speed.

1571,qs2QcycggWU,India
1572,qs2QcycggWU,Just amazing
1573,qs2QcycggWU,i have one question why is there no satellite flying above the north and south pole as i have seen in the video ? Thanks for answering my question.
1574,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
1575,qs2QcycggWU,3:37 I have Dishy Mc Flatface. Those motors move Dishy to align with the satellites for the initial setup but also move to align with other satellites from time to time.

1577,qs2QcycggWU,"Could you please use ""miles"" instead of kilometers, thanks"
1578,qs2QcycggWU,Wow..mind boggling..and and thanks for the selfless time you took to research and animate...let us how we can support your work..keep up the good work
1579,qs2QcycggWU,"i think is not the beast internet system for our feature, may be check LI FI......"
1580,qs2QcycggWU,"and don't forget that our orbit is filed in 10 or more thousand satellite which may have unknown side effect on Eco system. we need more innovation,
1, what if a disrupt occur on this multi billion project? all of this work will claps.... 
THINK BEFORE ADMIRING  SOMEONE"
1581,qs2QcycggWU,"2, What if china want to have satellite on the orbit and will it be crashed to star link because of too mach density or will this satellite move and it so the will be connection lost?"

1586,qs2QcycggWU,How is the fidelity of the the binary code sent in the 64QAM maintained with the constructive interference of the beam formers? Is there a demodulation process occurring at the StarLink satellite?
1587,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks you for working hard to bring this to us
1588,qs2QcycggWU,13:30 this amazing graphic/animation showing the field of radiation (including the circular polarizatiton !!! ) earned you my subscription. AMAZING ! I think the circular polarization is producing Tesla's longitudinal waves. THAT is why the connection round trip is so fast. They are manufactureing an entire sky antenna interface to the global computer-net that is based on tortion physics. The circular polarization between two oppositely poled emitters produces a tortion field. There is more here than meets the eye.
1589,qs2QcycggWU,Proper and in depth explanation thanks
1590,qs2QcycggWU,Incrediblely detailed....

1605,qs2QcycggWU,"The video was indeed the most informative video I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Still I wanted to become software engineer or a electronics and communication technology. But I couldn‚Äôt so the point the question which I wanted to ask is will these Starlin satellites affect the rockets or this or the satellites or the space exploration which are done by different countries all over the world because if 10,000 satellites are present in our lower earth orbit, then they might block the space area which could be detrimental in launching or sending any other satellites or rockets to the space, how will it be handle because my question is will be satellites not affecting the entire space eco ecosystem. I just wanted to know how space link will deal with these problems and how these satellites will be fixed if any problem occurs in them or will they be brought back to the earth surface and after repair they will be placed into their referred orbit"
1606,qs2QcycggWU,"As soon as more than 50,000 people get this it will be as slow as all the other internet providers. LOL  Aelon just snake oiled you to part with more dollar than any other internet provider"
1607,qs2QcycggWU,LIARS  no satellites exist

1613,qs2QcycggWU,"How does starlink work?

Poorly."
1614,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy McFlatFace's father was born in 1980, and resides in Bourne Massachusetts. His name is PAV PAWS and works on Flatrock Hill. He works as a custodian of the skies, by using a broom that sweeps a wide path of electrostatic electricity which inverts to a spike from massive, phased-array antennas that become axially aligned with the motion-vector of an incoming missile. The premises are more recently named space force."

1617,qs2QcycggWU,very cool
1618,qs2QcycggWU,This is fantastic
1619,qs2QcycggWU,For the most part....it doesn't work! lol oh and Over Priced
1620,qs2QcycggWU,"If the dish receives the exact coordinates of the satellites via software and aligns itself accordingly using the hardware, how does this work the other way around with the satellite so that the wave signals from the satellite combine exactly on my dish? How does the satellite hardware align itself with millions of different targets?"
1621,qs2QcycggWU,"It is mind-blowing how satelite ""have time"" to receive and deliver large amount of data to millions of users with no ""mixing"" data :)"
1622,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, Thank you"
1623,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Good work!
1624,qs2QcycggWU,"Well done , looking forward to your additional videos"
1625,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for a great video. Only unanswered question to me is why there are arrays of satellites.
1626,qs2QcycggWU,one of the best pages to explain electronic tech to mech engineers like myself!!! keep it up guys...
1627,qs2QcycggWU,TV satellites? Your graphic shows these moving relative to the earth's surface with a fixed ground dish. You lost me right there. Pseudoscience. Move on everyone.

1647,qs2QcycggWU,Watching on dishy Ontario Canada
1648,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder if this can  be used for 600 kilohertz to 500 megahertz. I bet it is only good for the gigahertz's band to bad it cant be used in the HAM radio bands HF VHF UHF VLF.
1649,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the knowledge üéâ‚ù§
1650,qs2QcycggWU,"One question: if a TV satellite can't send data then how do they detect how many people watch their programs, ads, and from where people watch their programs? Because they collect this information"
1651,qs2QcycggWU,in some sat-TVs there is a device that connects to the cellular networks to transmit these information.
1652,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine if we could receive and decode all those electric waves by our heads üòÇ everyone was talking like a TV that you can't turn off. Of course we are affected by those waves a little bit every year because those waves pass through our body and our body responds to those waves but we don't feel them.

1685,qs2QcycggWU,"I am amazed and blown away by the level of electronic technology as explained in this video.  I had an intense interest in electronics since I was a boy - first, building a crystal radio from a kit and then many more from scratch for my friends.  (they called me 'Brainwave')  Later on I built many more electronic projects first with tubes and later with transistors.  I grew up on a farm and was destined to be a farmer but my interest in electronics eventually led me to a career in mainframe computers starting in 1965.  And of course, I built my first personal computer from a magazine article around 1975.  Over the years I have gained a very good understanding of how radio and TV work, and the learned about computers from the ground up as I started my career as a field technician - installing and maintaining mainframe computers.  So my understanding and knowledge of electronic technology now also included the digital realm.  I am now 83 years old and many years retired and no longer in touch with the latest and greatest.  So it was most rewarding to come across this video and the clear explanation of the workings of modern satellite technology.  Thank you."

1695,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative and an excellent way to explain a complex technology. I used to work on phased arrays in underwater acoustics, mainly how to adaptively adjust the beam patterns to minimize the effects of ambient noise and interferences using minimum variance distortionless look (MVDR) calculations.  I wonder if such methods are planned for future upgrades?"
1696,qs2QcycggWU,"Man.

We oughta buy these things so easily not knowing the complexity of which they were made.
Thanks. 28mins was all worth it.

1699,qs2QcycggWU,"12 Megahertz affects Hearing in humans and causes an imbalance of Amino Acids in neurotransmitters of the human brain; A decrease in the concentration of a limiting amino acid in specific regions of the brain is followed by behavioral effects, especially a decrease in feed intake (Gietzen, 1993)."
1700,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing! Too much for my brain to handle.
1701,qs2QcycggWU,"What's going to happen when 100 different companies all want 10,000+ satellites up in space? We'll need the satellites to be treated like a utility, where competitors have to share them so that we're not just clogging up space with redundant satellites."

1704,qs2QcycggWU,just three words YOU ARE LEGEND ‚ù§
1705,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent, but the brilliant sponsor section praising elon musk probably didn't age terribly well..."
1706,qs2QcycggWU,"Stunning graphics, and a surprisingly clear explanation for such a complicated topic. Thank you!

I'm confused how info is reliably transmitted via phase shift. Iiuc, phase shift is relative ie if I'm sending a continuous signal and you pick it up midstream, you couldn't determine the phase shift, could you? Seems like the phase shift info is only apparent at the moment one symbol switches to another so if there's any hiccup at that point in time, some info would be lost. Maybe the phase is compared against a super accurate clock?"
1707,qs2QcycggWU,"does doppler affect how the signals are processed? I imagine the waves reaching the satellite are shifted when it is approaching or leaving the field of view of the antennas right? Also, what are the main differences between the circular and rectangular versions of the dishes?"
1708,qs2QcycggWU,"What an amazing explainer. Thank you for this video. Great explainer, amazing graphic animation, brilliant educational content overall. So impressed. You‚Äôve earned a follower. Keep up the good work mate. Cheers."

1712,qs2QcycggWU,how does it work? well first they convince you that musk is a genius then they sucker you into dropping 2 grand to buy THEIR equipment so they can lock you into needing them and give you substandard connection and speed... any questions?
1713,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah this is insane, please make more!"
1714,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
1715,qs2QcycggWU,We are understanding high complex technology in a very simple language. Thanks for sharing this informational video for everyone.
1716,qs2QcycggWU,Just want to know how much they charge
1717,qs2QcycggWU,"Last I remember, the service cost $100 USD/month and the equipment was a 1-time payment of around $400-$500."
1718,qs2QcycggWU,"Quick question, however, the Starlink DOES move throughout the day and time. You stated it is only moved at setup but that is not true. Why?"
1719,qs2QcycggWU,Worth it
1720,qs2QcycggWU,This is astonishing
1721,qs2QcycggWU,"awsomne! liek  iknow its always crazy when you put it in perspective, and we take it for granteds, but its such a large part of my education and its sooooooooooooooo insanely amazing i love it hah"

1743,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for a really good video lesson.  I learnt a lot and appreciate all the great efforts made into creating it.   I will refer to this video in my future lectures for communication engineers.  

May I humbly suggest one improvement.  Your TV satellite graphic animation seems erratic.  They should circle the earth in a geosynchronous manner, i.e., the angular rotation speed of the satellite is exactly the same as the earth rotation so that at any point on earth, we can find the geostationary satellite at a fixed angle.  Some correction in the animation will help viewers understand better."
1744,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best channel for education and visualization of current technology. Keep up the great work
1745,qs2QcycggWU,Not very well.
1746,qs2QcycggWU,"1st video from this Channel, definitely Loved.they take their time to explain how Startlink work rather than finishing it in 7 or 8 minutes also they Taught many small concepts from base within seconds to understand next process also animations of everything are just awesome like phase difference, wave front and Wave interference and Amplitude and Phrase Modulation, topics that never understand from ncert which your animations explained so easily under 5 to 10 seconds.
Loved it‚ù§.

However, i wonder would it be the down link beams intense that comes from the satellite harmful form human due to its vertical direction unlike the earth microwave dishes that are horizontal pointed on the BTS? 
Who will be responsible if the world got effected with cancers diseases as a result of this technology ????"
1776,qs2QcycggWU,"i thought phase was used to steer the beam to follow the satellite, so how can it also be modulated to trasmit the signal?"

1794,qs2QcycggWU,"@BranchEducation, I observed our Dishy changed its rotation and angle each night while at a beach on the West Coast. It would move from W to NW. I‚Äôm presuming this happens because the satellites are outside the 100¬∞ window. Does this sound logical?"

1806,qs2QcycggWU,VERY GOOOOD
1807,qs2QcycggWU,Small nitpick I have: your graphics show the geostationary satellites orbiting opposite to earths rotation which is wrong
1808,qs2QcycggWU,I have a question that is probably beyond the scope of this EXCELLENT video. If phase shifting is used for beam steering how is it also used to encode the six bits in the h.264 codec? Is the phase shift the shift to steer the beam in the signal completely separate from the phase shift of the EM wave (photos?) itself? Forgive my ignorance. Thank you so much.

Thanks for the video. Due to various career choices, I've worked with small subsets of radio theory all at different points of my life, and never really understood how they interacted. This video essentially forced 10 years of life experience to all exist in the same box for me, lol.

So when I say, I learned a lot from this video, I mean, I learned a LOT from this video. I can‚Äôt believe that I had no idea how they encoded bits. Everything else was pretty familiar to me. Although it‚Äôs amazing to me it took them 50 years to figure out how to do it right. Because we learned this in school when I was a kid. And now I‚Äôm 78, but look what they did in 50 years. It‚Äôs amazing. I do have a question though. If the encoding of bits involves amplitude of the wave, what happens when there is moisture in the air that varies the absorption. That would change the amplitude of the wave. Perhaps it‚Äôs all about being constant over a short period of time like a millisecond."
1901,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm a communications engineer. Weather is certainly a factor in terms of noise that will affect the received bits, but via the use of encoding, there are additional parity and checksum bits which are used to correct previously incorrectly decoded bits. For more information, you can look up information regarding Error Correcting Codes."

1947,qs2QcycggWU,"Too much (pointless)  information! You trying to teach China, Iran, India and N. Korea how to copy it, or what???üòÆ"
1948,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nice explanation, but only if you are actually able to reach into orbit. But of course NASA have been able to do the second best way to boost into orbit by way of CGI. The magical way! Just like NASA is very good Hollywood way!!! They also did the 9/11 towers  the Hollywood way using moving hollowgram pictures of two planes hitting the towers and movie like scenes for the highjacked planes. You know, paid false actors like what happened many times before!!! I guess I can call this comment a believe it or not comment.üò≠"
1949,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool. Nice job on the explanation. Was very nice to learn and I love how the video and animation was made to show and explain more üëè
1950,qs2QcycggWU,"I have to assume the Branch of Education you're on is NASA and Hollywood. The magic of educations in this world. The same like pharmacies who provides snake oil. A bit of good to intice for the bad to go down smoothly! In the last days, God will send down strong delusions in this world. üò≠"
1951,qs2QcycggWU,Exactly the. same way phased array radar
1952,qs2QcycggWU,"This was incredibly well explained, reminded me of the movie ""Passengers"" and the voice explaining how far the ship had really travelled."
1953,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good job, that part with Phase Array Beam Steering was mind blowing"
1954,qs2QcycggWU,"I haven't finished yet, but there's an inconsistency in the animation during the comparison to satellite TVs. In the animation, the earth is rotating opposite the satellite. Geosynchronous satellites are supposed to follow the earth's rotation."
1955,qs2QcycggWU,"There is no earth rotation.
Could you prove the rotating ball earth ?
If yes, bring me a uncut video (no fisheye lens) from 3 to 40 km above ground where we can see the earth rotating at the equator with 15 degrees per hour. 1 TURN around the own axis of the earth means at the equator 40000 km per day or 1666 kmh or 463 Meter per second

If you couldn't show that rotation as quick as a fighter jet / a 9mm machine pistol bullet / 14 times the speed of a class 5 hurricane -  the spinning ball earth does not exist.

And Please 
Show evidence that the rotating ball earth rotates simultaneously around the sun with the hypersonic speed of 108.000 km/h (one hundred and eight thousand km per hour). This is 30 km per second or nearly 65 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

Show simultaneously around the milky way with the hypersonic speed of nearly 800.000 km/h (eight hundred thousand km per hour). 
This is 222 km per second or nearly 481 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

Show evidence that the rotating ball earth rotates together with the sun simultaneously around the milky way with the hypersonic speed of nearly 800.000 km/h (eight hundred thousand km per hour). This is 555 km per second or nearly 1.200 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

If you do not deliver plausible and scientifically indisputable evidence
Than we have to say that these potential phenomenons did not exist.
And so the earth is flat and did not move."

1963,qs2QcycggWU,Cool video
1964,qs2QcycggWU,This is an amazing animated way to explain how a Starlink satellite communication system for Internet works. Really well done in terms of Engineering accuracy to simplifying it to speaking to a 12th grader (its too complicated for a 5th grader anyways)
1965,qs2QcycggWU,I remember watching watching Everyday Astronauts videos on this stuff in 2019 (or was it 2018? I don‚Äôt remember) and it was crazy. I didn‚Äôt know they had a running service by now. I wonder how the rocket launches are going. All I remember was watching crash after crash in 2020.

1980,qs2QcycggWU,"Great stuff, very well explained!"
1981,qs2QcycggWU,"hello there your support is badly needed to bring this scandal to the international community, 
for so many years now and employees of Saudi Aramco oil company are suffering from a conflict between 
the big guys with high positions in the company, minor employees pay the price for their fight,
employees being monitored 24/7 for reasons that they don't understand and being monitored  using 
the Targeted individual program that is only few in this world who knows about. 
it's a torture tool without evidence and technology that can be denied to exist, 
and when the victim complains about it they immediately call him/her psychopath. 
big entity like this company that is sinking in corruption have many ways to cover their shit with a lot of money. 
Media help is badly needed to investigate this crime. 
no matter how wired this message is what's happening is real and it's happening every single day."
1982,qs2QcycggWU,"Love the video! Thank you for that. The only issue I have is with your statement ""To help become a revolutionary engineer and entrepreneur like Elon Musk you have to be versed in a wide range of fields in science and engineering"". Unfortunately Elon Musk's science and engineering knowledge is quite poor as far as I can tell, being a professional engineer myself. In fact the only reason he is involved with those companies is because he grew up rich, his father having owned blood diamond mines."

2057,qs2QcycggWU,"Phase shifting is used to steer the EM beam to a particular star link. And it is also used to encode binary. How does that work. If the phase is changed to encode a binary, the constructive interference must shift right ?"
2058,qs2QcycggWU,The Russians claim that they have a way to jam this system.  Do you have any idea how they are doing this.?
2059,qs2QcycggWU,Just interfering with the waves by sending false signals that the sats pick up and don‚Äôt know what to deal with.
2060,qs2QcycggWU,@@imperialdoggo5826 false signal would not work since the satellite and ground station would have to handshake in order to know where to send a signal to.  Like a beam is being created that is really strong as it is focused between the satellite and ground station. Like everything else is being ignored. Somehow if the code to handshake is compromised I would think it might be possible to mess things up.  Possibly some spying or purposeful sharing could cause some problems.  I would not put it past some of the people at starlink.  Though it appears the Starlink is working throughout the Black Sea and most of Russia now. US military is now the main contract holder now.  I don't think Musk is loosing money on the program now.

I am a satellite communications engineer and although I don't have time to explain it all, I can say that the techniques for jamming Starlink satellites are not any different from the techniques used to jam normal satellites."

2101,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
2102,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. First, when the transmitting and receiving medium is wide open, someone could capture the same electromagnetic waves and construct the data, which basically is stealing the data. But then, I reminded myself of the encryption mechanisms to safeguard data security. However, I can beam unwanted signals to interfere with the actual signals originating/received by the Dishy, so my question is, how are users protected from targeted external interference?"

3:51: üì° The Dishy McFlatface antenna is a complex phased array system with 1280 antennas that work together to send and receive electromagnetic waves to and from Starlink satellites.
7:43: ‚ú® The patch antenna generates oscillating electric and magnetic fields that create an electromagnetic wave.
11:36: üì° Antenna patches are designed to transmit and receive specific frequencies, while blocking out all other frequencies.
15:20: üì° The video discusses the use of phased array beam steering to angle a powerful beam towards Starlink satellites.
18:41: üõ∞ Phase shifting is used to angle the beam and point it directly at the satellite in Dishy.
22:53: üì° Dishy and the Starlink satellite use 64QAM modulation to send data, with each symbol lasting 10 nanoseconds.

2105,qs2QcycggWU,"Love this video!!!  You are very easy to understand and you explain stuff that's Hard for us to understand into like chunks that are not hard to swallow. I didn't even know the dishy was half - duplex. Also that the dish doesn't track the sat physically which makes sense. Like you said, you would break the motor within a month or two.   

You should do the GEN 2 dish."

2131,qs2QcycggWU,"Has it been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this technology will not interfere with bird, and insect migrations, or any other natural signal that emulates life as natural biology and evolution of earthly species?"
2132,qs2QcycggWU,No. Any EMF doesn‚Äôt become dangerous until about 300 GHz. There is no safety risk.
2133,qs2QcycggWU,What about the night sky star pollution as thousands of these things light up the night sky instead . What will the psychological effect on humans as well other species? @@imperialdoggo5826
2134,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanations and visuals. Love it
2135,qs2QcycggWU,You should do a brief video of what's different about version one versus version 2 starlink
2136,qs2QcycggWU,Tv satelite rotating counter earth rotation 
2137,qs2QcycggWU,Words can't express the scale of knowledge in your videos. I use Starlink daily (heck this comment is being sent to you via Starlink at this moment) and now I understand more how all this is possible. It's incredible how this works and the labor of love you put on these explanations. Thank you.

2139,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a ad on vulcan tv üññ
2140,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. I‚Äôm a Radio planning engineer and this is by far the best explanation of so many steps of the wireless communication system!!!!!
2141,qs2QcycggWU,Very good overview
2142,qs2QcycggWU,The videos on this channel have really allowed me to appreciate just how complex technology is and just how tiny and precise some of the things that hold up our lives are!
2143,qs2QcycggWU,"Last year as i gazed out across puget sound I viewed what ibptesumedva star yet elongated enough i considered my vision the cause 
My gf however saw it and was unable to figure out what it was because it was too lomg to be a star well about 3 of us stood outside as light was quickly fading after a lovely sunset
As it definayely did not look like a satelite nor a plane yet it moved like blimp speed
The length was significantly bizarre i had nothing
The speculation was that it was a starlink train 
It was like a train or taunt chain of equidistant lights
So my eye is able to detect the light emitted from above 
Does the anttena actially collect human eyes that are unsuitable for implants and harvest mechanisms in the eye in order to produce some adpect of this technology 
I dont mean that its like seeing but the eye ball us just a mechanisms"
2144,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome first viewing of Branch Education.
2145,qs2QcycggWU,"#Mindblown.

2160,qs2QcycggWU,"Please, What's GPS?"
2161,qs2QcycggWU,"Every person on the planet should be made to watch these and similar videos y'all made until it is understood. Te technologies that make our world work are greatly underappreciated.

2162,qs2QcycggWU,The best explanation!
2163,qs2QcycggWU,Yep - you got that right - jaw
2164,qs2QcycggWU,this is a really interesting topic and technology. thank you for such nice video
2165,qs2QcycggWU,thanks so much
2166,qs2QcycggWU,"The most mind boggling thing about this is how such a small satellite can deal with so many different requests and unique 'data packages' sent to each consumer. You'd think id' all get jumbled up or that you'd need a 1:1 ratio for it to work. I have the same question about cell phone towers. Secondly is how tf does the signal reach space without getting absorbed by the atmosphere or dissipating, kinda like a 2 meter wave in an ocean 5 km away."
2167,qs2QcycggWU,"28:08 In the whole electromagnetic wave transmission section, you missed out the most fascinating part which I would love to understand - how do those oscillation become data, aka 1s and 0s, on and off. I mean if the whole thing is oscilating constantly it'd just be 010101010101 constantly which is kinda useless. I know how an antenna works, but I don't understand how exactly the correct signal is made."
2168,qs2QcycggWU,"This channel is so damn good in graphics and teardown... but then you get such weird comments as ""watch at 1.25 speed"" like what even? By far the strangest educational channel I've ever seen... It's like so professional in the presentation, but so awkward with the PR/audience messaging lmao"
2169,qs2QcycggWU,I Love your videos. Please keep them coming

2171,qs2QcycggWU,This is  only channed in the subscribe list
2172,qs2QcycggWU,"I just can't dimension all the work-hours, brilliant minds and development resources that were needed to engineer this technological marvel, includin all the people involved on understanding, applying and discovering all the science behind this throughout the history. It's just incredible!"
2173,qs2QcycggWU,it's the easy explanation I have ever seen. thank you to the team who make this exciting content. also thanks to Mr.Starlink he supports humans in the digital world seen.

2176,qs2QcycggWU,19:13 I know how AESA radar works. So the way you explain it is just genius and completely fall into my expectation.
2177,qs2QcycggWU,"Like it or not , Elon Musk  is the current icon & father of Invention."
2178,qs2QcycggWU,how about the cloudy weather the signal is good?
2179,qs2QcycggWU,"Heavy thunderstorms will interfere, but simple clouds won't."
2180,qs2QcycggWU,that is amazing many thanks
2181,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible video. Thanks for putting in the time and effort to create it!

One more question I have is how does Dishy switch between satellites and not drop the connection?

I assume the satellites communicate with each other to remember the last bit and basically continues from there?

Does the switch between satellites happened very quickly? So there's no drop in packets?"
2182,qs2QcycggWU,You are doing a great job my friend
2183,qs2QcycggWU,"@BranchEducation Please do a feature on how a Starlink satellite is able to interact with a number of Dishy McFlatface of various users at the same time. Thanks for the above video and greatly  appreciate your contents on educating us on the technologies we are surrounded with and hardly realise the complex maths, physics and engineering that these are equipped with."

2186,qs2QcycggWU,Good Work
2187,qs2QcycggWU,who invented and designed this unbelievable technology ?
2188,qs2QcycggWU,"quien es el freaking genio detras de esto, cada solucion a cada problemas es exponencialmente mas estupidamente simple y de igual manera mindblowing."
2189,qs2QcycggWU,Would have become scientist if I have watched these videos in my childhood
2190,qs2QcycggWU,"What if it rains, what if it snows or it¬¥s too hot for our starlink device... will it keep working?"
2191,qs2QcycggWU,PCB can overheat working in 40+ C. Rain is irrelevant and snow is melted by heat.
2192,qs2QcycggWU,I AM AMAZED BY THESE TYPE OF EXPLANATIONS. I LOVED IT . PLEASE KEEP MAKING VIDEOS LIKE THIS. IT IS BRILIANT!
2193,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much
2194,qs2QcycggWU,There are 20 shooting stars
2195,qs2QcycggWU,"Really good presentation 
Loved every bit of it"
2196,qs2QcycggWU,This video has inadvertently helped me to understand QPSK modulation
2197,qs2QcycggWU,"That is a very impressive video, thanks for taking so much trouble."

2199,qs2QcycggWU,So using two Dishis you can create a long range wireless internet connection and fly an autonomous drone without the usage of a satelite system. You just need to modify part of the software. Boom!
2200,qs2QcycggWU,"OH MY GOD!!!  I was outside last night watching the International Space Station fly over Atlanta.  THEN!  I saw this line of about 10-12 lights in a perfectly straight line, an equal distance from one another.  The lights were about a quarter as bright as the ISS.  A quick Google search told me that Elon Musk was to blame.  I ""never"" called it a UFO and thanks to this (most excellent) presentation, it still ain't a UFO...lol.  THANK YOU from Elon all the way down to the Janitors for making this explanation happen.  My next quest is to find out when and where to look for the satellites in the future!!!"
2201,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video

2222,qs2QcycggWU,amazing explanation. Thats a real quality work . Thanks 
2223,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellites that provide TV signals do not orbit the earth. They are in geo stationary orbit. Hence their altitude, dude. As you said, TV signal satellite antennas are fixed focus, so, if the TV satellite was moving, you'd have no TV signal. And this basic error after many iterations of content review!"
2224,qs2QcycggWU,No words. Incredible  üî•

2235,qs2QcycggWU,"I've always had an inventive or creative nature; but realized that I lack many core competencies... such as Calculus, Topology, Electronics, Mechanics, and many other super useful subject matter.

Very, VERY appreciative of the information you share here, how you put it all together so elegantly.  I was not bored in the least; but overwhelmed.  Yet, very excited to realize how information nests together to solve problems for technology.

I not only want to invent new technology; but live off grid; and so, I am finding this video extremely gratifying with those goals in mind.

I've been thinking about getting a subscription to Brilliant; and after this, I believe I will.

I subscribed to your channel on the strength of this video, alone.

Your dedication to educating the rest of us in entertaining and in a highly ingenious, manner, taking several months to gather all the information and piece it together like this, is astounding.

I would have to say there aren't many channels I've come across that does as a great a job exploring cutting edge technology, as yours does.  Of course, I haven't had a chance to watch any of your other videos; but I'm making the assumption here, that how you'll do the rest of your videos will probably be quite similar to how you did this one; at least with respect to dedication, care, and professionalism.

I'm just blown away how much you had to research and wonder how you got all that information?  I'm not prying.  Just glad that you guys exist.

2321,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow!!!  So clear and easily understood.  As a retired professional developer of educational material, I have to give the developers 5 stars!  Makes me want to go back to college for engineering.  Thanks a million!"
2322,qs2QcycggWU,"so professional, even though I'm an enthusiast and don't understand so much about the technical things I'm glad you made sure to make it clear for everyone, got a new subscriber!"
2323,qs2QcycggWU,What program makes these animations?
2324,qs2QcycggWU,Does anyone here use starlink or is it just for twitters tweeting
2325,qs2QcycggWU,It's phenomenal to get to watch this while using my dishy. Thank you for the explanation! It was both very informing and captivating!
2326,qs2QcycggWU,Great vid guys
2327,qs2QcycggWU,Heads upüéâüéâ
2328,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this magnificent video. What is the total transmission capacity of a single starlink satellite?
2329,qs2QcycggWU,"so cool and fun to watch and learn, this already made my day watching it first thing in the morning!!!"
2330,qs2QcycggWU,good
2331,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nice video,"
2332,qs2QcycggWU,Is great that this channel exists!
2333,qs2QcycggWU,Valeu!
2334,qs2QcycggWU,yesss it is really mind blowing technology and your presentation
2335,qs2QcycggWU,It work in trillion dollar tax debt. Lol
2336,qs2QcycggWU,Great Work !!!
2337,qs2QcycggWU,just wooow!
2338,qs2QcycggWU,Question ‚Ä¶.. so 4 or 5 or even 10 years down the road will you have to buy a new or updated kit ???
2339,qs2QcycggWU,"I reporting this channel fr







Every damn thing they create piques my curiosity and I can‚Äôt sleep without watching that video!!"
2340,qs2QcycggWU,Lol
2341,qs2QcycggWU,This is mindblowing...very mind blowing...gives me goosebump.. Sine cosine tagent graph I learned back in highschool it was basic and easy concept at the time but it is quite significant factor in this radio telecommuication devices...I also fly drones and there is active tracking device that mechanically points the video receiver patch antenna towards a drone so I thought the Dishy also does that too but phased array beam steering?!!!!!!!! whahhaaaaaa this is crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! üòØüòØüòØüòØüòØüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ
2342,qs2QcycggWU,"guys im understand, believe me :("
2343,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best video related to technology that I've seen ever.
2344,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink = more advanced ground based towers and undersea cables together with high altitude balloons topped with a huge pile of bull crap‚Ä¶.speaking of bull crap note the exaggerated views üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ waaaaaaake up people‚Ä¶ Elon is hysterically laughing at you all.
2345,qs2QcycggWU,Extremely well done. ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù use of visuals and just enough detail to get the concept.
2346,qs2QcycggWU,The concept is for mentally challenged people.
2347,qs2QcycggWU,"So far, one of the best video on the topic. And I am a microwave engineer working in the space business. Hats off."
2348,qs2QcycggWU,Good video
2349,qs2QcycggWU,Danke!

2351,qs2QcycggWU,I love it
2352,qs2QcycggWU,great
2353,qs2QcycggWU,Loved it.üî•üî•
2354,qs2QcycggWU,One of the most brilliant explanation i have ever seen
2355,qs2QcycggWU,Star link doesn't pay for telecommunication engineering
2356,qs2QcycggWU,You all deserve an honorary PhD in EE.  There are many professors who will never be able to explain it as clearly as your video.  Disclaimers ob advanced theory were icing on the cake.  Thank you.
2357,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video very well explained! Thank you and congrats! üëçüèª
2358,qs2QcycggWU,"I‚Äôm a field scientist/engineer and considered pretty smart. But I‚Äôm eating my crayons compared to the minds that develop tech like this. 

Those that design chips, and especially those who develop the tools to build them, I‚Äôm convinced are immersed in Spice Gas somewhere living like the Dune Spacing Guild navigators."
2359,qs2QcycggWU,definitely you are doing a great job. Thanks a lot
2360,qs2QcycggWU,Ukrainian Armed Forces said Starlink great one
2361,qs2QcycggWU,"So they didn't find the way of forming of separate 'antennas' by each point of antenna, making such source uninterruptable in complex signal producing view. Very interesting.  Discrete chipsets use weaker strength, overpassed by common coherent enforcement made by interference. While they don't use whole antenna area for good strength, rather width and stability. 


When you warm up the plate, it gives temperature spot for all atoms, reflecting, with assumption to all, in some interval, changes of 'flame.


But these flows are not directed. As temperature flows glue up to almost anything around, producing specific plasma. üòâ 

Thus temperature can be directed and isolated. Thus never evaluate temperature of stars as of warm heap you make in pretty not developed nuclear reactors. Having no knowledge in protonuclear reactions having STRUCTURED and controlled vibrations of specific type, with appearing of structured plasma flows, that can be managed changing directions of particles and not only...


Sounds like science fiction. 

- Thus I would like to ask Mask:


While satellite passes Earth orbit, it is 'unhooked' by one gravity forces (with own vectors) leading to approximately center of Earth, and hooked by another one? üòÖ

Or they are same? Like instant connection that appears or disappears at some point like some glue or well stretching strip? I like interesting questions... üòä


Or where is inertia stored, accumulated? Being some substance etc? Like water in cane? üòâ As it is impossible otherwise."
2362,qs2QcycggWU,Crazy video!
2363,qs2QcycggWU,Insane detail‚ù§
2364,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, I'm truly impressed by the immense effort and dedication that went into creating this video. The level of detail and clarity in explaining how Starlink works is absolutely commendable. It's evident that a tremendous amount of research, planning, and creativity was poured into every aspect. Thank you for taking the time to educate and inspire us. Keep up the fantastic work!"
2365,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! I was always curious how wavelengths transmit data. You explained it really well.

2371,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
2372,qs2QcycggWU,"I would love to see a video on how different types of antennas work. Such as helical antennas, patch antennas, and omnidirectional antennas."
2373,qs2QcycggWU,Had no idea it was so simple!
2374,qs2QcycggWU,The production quality that went into this video just earned you another subsciber
2375,qs2QcycggWU,"The videos created by this channel are absolutely astonishing. Each one has a quality and depth that can be matched by only a few others. I love how even the intricate details are discussed, without getting lost in it. The research and work that goes in each video must be immense.

2386,qs2QcycggWU,Write a comment below... ‚úì
2387,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation!
2388,qs2QcycggWU,There is one thing I don't understand. Both data encoding (the 6 bits) and beamforming (interferences) rely on changing the phase of the emitted/received signal right ? How do they not penalize each other ?
2389,qs2QcycggWU,"Beamforming relies on individual phase shift. 
Data transmission relies on phase shift of the entire beam."
2390,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
2391,qs2QcycggWU,The level of minutiae served up here is over the moon crazy. I suppose if you're wanting to get hired on you'd need to pass the test after watching the video. As he says @ 15:12 lets move on. I saw the train flying over last night and it was quite a sight!
2392,qs2QcycggWU,More Please
2393,qs2QcycggWU,Copy from dram video
2394,qs2QcycggWU,"I am an old radar tech.  It is nice to see confirmation for one of my ""rule of thumb"" theories how they did this. Awesome."
2395,qs2QcycggWU,"As an ex telecoms engineer, I knew most of the aerial theory, which you presented in a marvellous way.   The QAM  modulation theory was new to me however, so thanks for that.   I think you missed out the bit that your demo only showed one receive dish and one satellite.  Whereas the one satellite has to maybe serve 1000 ground stations simultaneously, maybe using Time Domain Multiplexing...  I hope your next video will cover this simple aspect."
2396,qs2QcycggWU,coool
2397,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool , after watching this i also wanted to be an engineer"
2398,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video  will definitely be watching more

2480,qs2QcycggWU,me like video so I make comment below like commanded
2481,qs2QcycggWU,"Now we know why is so expensive. But this solution is made for who doesn't have access to internet in those areas where there are no cable connections. There are many areas even in well advancede countries, upper the montain or some high hills, or in the middle on nowhere, usefull especialli if we'll be able to give signal to our mobilephones, Apple already started to develop it, but just for emergency calls, it seems the future will be satellites connections also for our mobilephones.

2488,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is a YouTube treasure. I hope it never goes away. By far the best educational channel I‚Äôve ever come across.
2489,qs2QcycggWU,After 8 months YouTube decided to how me this masterpieceü•≥
2490,qs2QcycggWU,Can starlink consider having data centers at high altitudes( 4500 ft to 7000 ft) in northeren climate ; thus starlink would achieve an overall reduction NW latency by about 0.44 ms to .64 ms with reduced opex?!
2491,qs2QcycggWU,"this is the most descriptive, narration wise, and mind blowingly on point illustration, all years of studying signals and wireless transmission feels like studying magic and cult knowledge. but with  this video i feel like finally understanding whats happening behind the antenna scene. So cool, really the best illustration ever. really grateful i finnaly understands the magic lessons i've been afraid of all this years in college"
2492,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm blown by the animation and knowledge of physics and Math.

2495,qs2QcycggWU,What is the difference between Starlink and GPS?
2496,qs2QcycggWU,I read an article recently saying that starlink might not last much longer of telcos get their way for 5g as they are looking at using the 12Ghz if they do how about Elon says ok I will make a telco with 5G operating in the 12Ghz band and give a better service than any telco could offer since it wouldn't have much issue anywhere on earth and could be a global roaming with no extra fees üòâ
2497,qs2QcycggWU,Greatvifro guys! So much work
2498,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
2499,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind-blowing and very humbling.
2500,qs2QcycggWU,"This technology existed since 1905, called beamforming.
It's just that nobody was idiotic enough to put 4,000 satellites in orbit now and plan to add 40,000 more in the near future.
The business model for such is yet to be proven as the typical lifetime of an LEO satellite is 7‚Äì10 years."
2501,qs2QcycggWU,do a video about airtags!! the precision finding is amazing tech.
2502,qs2QcycggWU,Right hand rule where the emission perpendicular to the path the finger or current travels.   I think the electromagnetism wave is traveling the circumference of the single antenna.  That is why the transceiver is octangle or hextangle versus a flat disk.There is installation and a small path or tunnel between each transceiver.
2503,qs2QcycggWU,awesome video
2504,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for sharing
2505,qs2QcycggWU,This is excellent work!
2506,qs2QcycggWU,"Frauds and liars....I've mentioned this many times,;  I'm a USAF veteran with over 1000 hrs of training in electronics and communications with 4 years as an Avionic Communications Specialist...I worked on the largest cargo and passenger aircraft in the world. Both as an enlisted man and civilian at SFO and OAK Airports on 747,767,A300 airbus, DC 9, DC 10 etc...

I was responsible for ALL communications systems including installing, modifying, troubleshooting and removal of UHF,VHF, FM, HF and CDPIR- Crash data position Indicator and recorders ( the black box) NOT ONE SINGLE SYSTEM INTERFACES WITH ANY SATELLITE; EVER....There is NO COMMUNICATIONS LINK between a satellite or aircraft...The power required to send a signal THROUGH THE 50 MILE THICK earth atmosphere, then BACK through 50 mile thick atmosphere would be staggering...

Satellite TV; ISN'T. All ground antenna point to a larger array. GPS is a ground based system and THAT'S why you see more and more repeater towers going up ALL OVER THE  WORLD!"
2507,qs2QcycggWU,Wouldn't the signal be stronger if you point the antenna at the ground rather then the sky?
2508,qs2QcycggWU,@@lolxnn What do you think?

2523,qs2QcycggWU,MY BRAIN OVERLOADED
2524,qs2QcycggWU,WELL DONE SIR
2525,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is already outdated garbage. The satellites are cheap very poorly shielded junk and dozens die with every solar flare. They are creating a ridiculous amount of space garbage and ruining views of ground based telescopes. They are nothing but a semi-fraudulent cash grab by a crooked leader of a personality cult.
2526,qs2QcycggWU,Nice üëç
2527,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy's gain should be 1280X that of a single element, unless there's some form of focusing horn on each (of approximately 2 dB).  This video was well done!"

2530,qs2QcycggWU,25:57 well that's a shame.
2531,qs2QcycggWU,"Simple explanation, just  a basic understanding of waves, EM and terminologies are required. kudos to the research."
2532,qs2QcycggWU,"I really recommend this video to electrical engineering students, especially the ones learning antenna now. Back then in school we were just taught the maths behind it, and no clear explanation of the application like this, which was very boring, doing those complex and vector analysis without visualization.  THANS FOR THIS VIDEO"
2533,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, really great animations!"
2534,qs2QcycggWU,"Teddy these videos are fucking nuts I read on your website and Vision and am beyond impressed you've set out on this journey and have succeeded in creating such BEAUTIFULLY rendered, narrated, and explained videos."
2535,qs2QcycggWU,Elon musk wants to tweet from interstellar space and it reach earth instantly üòÇ
2536,qs2QcycggWU,This is mind boggling and simply amazing
2537,qs2QcycggWU,You all did such a premium job on this video!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
2538,qs2QcycggWU,What a marvellous video !
2539,qs2QcycggWU,"Liked, subbed, and commentedüëçüèæ"
2540,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm not sure if it was mentioned in the canadian subtitles, but the constellation would be arranged such that adjacent bitcodes are easily distinguished from each other in order to reduce the effect of error. In general, the probability of error is inversely related to the smallest distance between points on the constellation, so one option is to make adjacent signals on the constellation obviously different from each other so that error-detecting and correction algorithms on the receive-side can work to mitigate error signals more effectively than if the bitcodes were arranged in sequential order."
2541,qs2QcycggWU,"very very impressive
as a ECE student it helps me a lot
thank you for your hard work"
2542,qs2QcycggWU,I deserve your team work...extremally excellent work..  keep it up..

2548,qs2QcycggWU,nice
2549,qs2QcycggWU,"So good to now how this amazing system works, I work in the remote Pilbara in Western Australia , we are now in our region exploration time, I was given a Starlink to install at our camp, so amazing how small and simple to setup. Much better communications just using our cell phones rather than sat phones."
2550,qs2QcycggWU,good
2551,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing and excellent.increible y muy interesante
2552,qs2QcycggWU,Sho I loved it
2553,qs2QcycggWU,What *he* said
2554,qs2QcycggWU,"you all are so naive. THERE ARE NO SATELITES, wakey wakey sheeple. The so-called satellite communication or broadcast is done on a type of frequency band. Military use a different frequency band , Police use a different frequency band, HAM radios use a different frequency band, cell phones use a different frequency band. Starlink uses a different frequency band. That transmit the radio waves VIA COMMUNICATION TOWERS on EARTH not from so-called satellites????? I will give anyone $10,000 to provide proof of a satellite in so-called space, photographed from earth's surface NOT a CGI image. I will give anyone $20,000 that can provide proof of ANTI_GRAVITY technology that works outside that the Military industrial complex uses on their man-made space craft. Explain this to your self - How does a satellite stay in orbit flying around the earth 24/7/365?????? How much fuel does a satellite need to stay in orbit????? What type of fuel does a satellite use????? What kind of propulsion system does a satellite use to navigate space??? If you can see space craft fly over the surface of the moon with a telescope, why can't you see a so-called satellite flying a quarter of the distance away.????  If there are 1000's of so-called satellites flying around in orbit, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THEY???? Stop being brain dead idiot's people. NASA LIES MATTER lol."
2555,qs2QcycggWU,"The fact that you don't understand does not mean that is not true. I have a simple question, if the signals are broadcasted from the ground then why is the signal present only if i point the antenna at the sky?"
2556,qs2QcycggWU,This technology is nothing compared to the beam forming technology by AST Spacemobile to stream to an ordinary unmodified cell phone. No dish required. Launching next year!
2557,qs2QcycggWU,"that's amazing, thank you!"
2558,qs2QcycggWU,This tecnology is from this earth?
2559,qs2QcycggWU,The amount of information your videos give is truly remarkable! The next 5 years will be the most fascinating time ever in history. The advancement in technology and the advancement in AI will be extremely scary as to the potential harm or good that it can have for all mankind. Cyber security is going to play a massive role within the next 5 years! Read a book called Snow Crash. Comprehend and see where we are in the timeline.
2560,qs2QcycggWU,trully a mind blowing tech
2561,qs2QcycggWU,"550 Km outside earth's atmosphere?????  Earth's atmosphere stretches from the surface of the planet up to as far as 10,000 kilometers!!!!"
2562,qs2QcycggWU,"Watched this on 2x speed, now I feel like Flash and everyone is talking slowly."
2563,qs2QcycggWU,Great
2564,qs2QcycggWU,As a communication engineer mostly engaged with equations and physics during my research studies should confess condensing the whole thing in an animation intuitively is another technology to my eyes. Great Job.
2565,qs2QcycggWU,The work behind this video is creeping me out.
2566,qs2QcycggWU,"Hello, as Starlink user i must say, your work is absolute same high quality like Starlink! RESPECT! I don`t understand but can imagine ...... thanX"
2567,qs2QcycggWU,"I just found the gem üíé channel on YouTube 

I think you can setup your own starlink (Apparts from fund discussion)"
2568,qs2QcycggWU,Wow and wow üëè.  you have a new sub today.
2569,qs2QcycggWU,"The animation of tv satellites is misleading. Unlike low-orbit Star link sats, the tv sats are in geo-stationary orbit. That means they appear to not move, relative to anybody's home satellite dish. In the animation the tv sats circle the Earth in a clockwise direction while the Earth spins counterclockwise, viewed fm North Star. In truth the rotation is the same, exactly."
2570,qs2QcycggWU,In class 12 we learnt all about ci and di and phase... But but but using phase to change direction of interference was just mind blowing
2571,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a radio engineer. I just want to say....Waw, explaining beam forming using massive antenna array ! That is very hard thing to do but you had the simplest and clearest explanation that I have ever seen!"
2572,qs2QcycggWU,"Truly wish we could get a Starlink technology day, to explain what is possible and what they accomplished, and also to educate people that think Starlink is similarly dangerous as 5G can be..."
2573,qs2QcycggWU,"As a radio engineer, do you think all our future advancements are dangerous at all?  5G for example, and even all the starlinks that Elon is transmitting?"
2574,qs2QcycggWU,as a radio engineer you should be smart enough to smell the BULLSHIT ...
2575,qs2QcycggWU,"A little note on comparing the orbits of the TV broadcast satellites and Starlink, from 2:10 onwards: ""Communications satellites used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit (geosynchronous orbit with prograde motion 35,900 km above the equator), so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite.""
In your (magnificent) video the TV satellite is not geostationary."

2579,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Thank you!
2580,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
2581,qs2QcycggWU,So the device is essentially a mixer and an antenna in the same component? And it‚Äôs like a gazillion of them  formed on a PC board. ü§î You weren‚Äôt kidding. This thing is BRILLIANT!
2582,qs2QcycggWU,Such an awesome channel
2583,qs2QcycggWU,Is the Ukrainian army still using Starlink to target civilians   in the Donbas ?
2584,qs2QcycggWU,Yes...Never have and never will use any Musk business products.
2585,qs2QcycggWU,wait so we use energy to make electro waves.. what about transforming electro waves back to power?

2610,qs2QcycggWU,"It is so depressing to me that people think Musk himself is doing this... He's a 50 year old man child who just buys stuff and whines all day... The engineers should be getting the praise, never ever him."
2611,qs2QcycggWU,"Talking about phased arrays, can you make a video in the difference between AESA and PESA radars?"
2612,qs2QcycggWU,Two words.  Blown Away!
2613,qs2QcycggWU,amazing work on the video
2614,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, perfect level of explanation, appreciated the attention to scale, speed etc at the end."

2630,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown good job I skipped right to 1.5 speed woah!!
2631,qs2QcycggWU,starlink is indeed future
2632,qs2QcycggWU,humans are fascinating
2633,qs2QcycggWU,I have star link.  And it works day and night better then any other option I have for internet. I‚Äôm completely happy with it.

2640,qs2QcycggWU,I‚Äôm a starlink owner for almost a year. Such a bullshit. The app itself is useless. Same as the internet speed.
2641,qs2QcycggWU,More thank that. The antenna itself isn‚Äôt as a dish. Is has a square shaped antenna.
2642,qs2QcycggWU,I use starlink everyday and I don't have any problem with the speeds
2643,qs2QcycggWU,Only liking and subscribing this channel for their mind blowing research and mind blowing technology made by us ( humans)üòÆ
2644,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work? -Spoiler, it don't"
2645,qs2QcycggWU,Works great for me
2646,qs2QcycggWU,"As a Starlink user I think that this type of Internet service is the most ground breaking satellite Internet technology to ever be created! Also my life heavily relies on technology for the most simple things because of my physical disability, so having this Internet service makes life 1 million times easier to control all of my smart home devices. Huge props to Elon and his crew at SpaceX for creating such advanced Internet technology, not only does this help Connect people to the Internet in rural areas but it also gives us access to Internet speeds that are far greater then other rural Internet companies. 

In my mind I really think starlink is also the way of the future when it comes to Internet technology when travelling by airplane or when travelling on cruise ships. I am actually really excited to see some Cruise ships companies actually sign up and have this service installed on their ships, that way they have the ability to keep up with Internet traffic while in the middle of the sea."
2647,qs2QcycggWU,I want to see that formula at the end explain.
2648,qs2QcycggWU,great vid! thank you
2649,qs2QcycggWU,"I've been using Starlink at home for almost 2.5 years. I never really understood how it worked until I saw this video. This is absolutely mind-blowing, and legitimately brought me to tears, out of sheer amazement."
2650,qs2QcycggWU,my brain hurts.
2651,qs2QcycggWU,"i live out in the county and before starlink my net speed was 0.82, now with starlink its 205mbps"
2652,qs2QcycggWU,"This video deserves millions of views because of the sheer amount of work put into it. 

I don't understand all the concepts but I feel better enlightened about something that'll soon become an everyday use item. 

Thank you Branch education! You guys are the bomb!

Btw, i loosely counted give or take 8 stars."
2653,qs2QcycggWU,you understand that this scenario requires milions of fairly inteligent youtube users within certain intetest zone in order to  be possible
2654,qs2QcycggWU,@@StrangeWorld11191 plus time
2655,qs2QcycggWU,Bestest way I have ever learned and visulized any topic.  Such a great video üëçüôè
2656,qs2QcycggWU,"Does this work in high wind areas where the dish might get buffeted about in the wind? Does it use a lot of power to constantly rotate the dish, ie does it work in off grid situations?"
2657,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, it works in extreme winds. I get wind gusts up to 80 mph, and it works just fine. The satellite dish uses about 150 to 200 watts of power. A modestly sized solar array could easily power this, with battery backup for night time."
2658,qs2QcycggWU,@@TrevorSullivan Thanks.
2659,qs2QcycggWU,"My dish doesn't constantly rotating but it does constantly use power, like the other commenter said."
2660,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic video as always, thanks for for your hard work!"
2661,qs2QcycggWU,"500 miles is the distance between the satellite and the satellite. Why do we not find transmitters like this on the ground? I work in the field of the Internet. The price of a transmitter with a capacity of 1 gigabyte is four thousand dollars, only sending to a distance of 40 kilometers"
2662,qs2QcycggWU,What a perfetc explanation
2663,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this vid. I sent it in face to shut people up.
2664,qs2QcycggWU,"A coolant to work a working system.

2665,qs2QcycggWU,So appreciate of videos like this. Thank you!!
2666,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, the animations were top notch and explanation simple enough for most viewers. I'm guessing there is a session handover mechanism between satellites as they enter a coverage zone. Most of the RF concepts are similar to the 4G LTE/5G world, except the user element is stationary while the base station (satellite) is mobile. Plus the distances are much longer than a normal telecom basestation."

2671,qs2QcycggWU,"To have a stronger internet you'd need many or one huge satellite on the ground on earth thus increasing the distance n radiance to catch higher powered space beams from a distance
Really big ones on coordinate ends on N,E,W,S

2691,qs2QcycggWU,you are awesome
2692,qs2QcycggWU,Damn
2693,qs2QcycggWU,Looks like a very expensive and ambitious project. To have that many satellites in orbit webbed around the earth is far from a walk in park...
2694,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy Mcflatface.
2695,qs2QcycggWU,Yes
2696,qs2QcycggWU,Bro this video was INSANE I never knew that such a small pizza like dish was so much complitcated in reality. You just earnt a new sub
2697,qs2QcycggWU,"@2:18 it says Broadcast satellite cannot send data. This is not true. It can for years. Digital TV is just sending data packets bearing video, audio or IP."
2698,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing and very interesting video. I had never seen such video' in which very complex and state of art Technology explaned in awesome way.  Efforts and struggles for this video is extremely, highly appreciated."
2699,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent
2700,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video.
 I really enjoyed  watching this video.
thank you so much"
2701,qs2QcycggWU,so here we are sending data from dishy to satalite but satalite gets changed in every 5-10nsec and lost my connection too with data satalite how the second setalite know my information where i was and what to send as a response
2702,qs2QcycggWU,My background is in history. I don't know much about Mathematics or Physics.  So I cannot fully understand it.
2703,qs2QcycggWU,"Very cool, overly complicated, I cannot fully understand it. I like it however."
2704,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome job
2705,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this in HD using starlink :)
2706,qs2QcycggWU,"wonderful rendition, very very erudite. i would love to be part of this next level of keep the whole world connected ."
2707,qs2QcycggWU,and its  owned by a guy whos  completely unaccountable to those that use this service in terms of the risks he takes with it effecting their service. this is why it should be owned by those that operate the service and use it with a board that is elected by these two parties.
2708,qs2QcycggWU,What are you talkin about
2709,qs2QcycggWU,"If these dishy can focus powerful microwave waves , and we use a microwave oven case around the dishy can it cook food ?ü§î"
2710,qs2QcycggWU,It isn't powerful. When it will reach ground it will be way less then radiation from sun.
2711,qs2QcycggWU,"kind of education like this, i would have become an another Elon.. kudos to the creators.."
2712,qs2QcycggWU,Phased array on the roof! What a future
2713,qs2QcycggWU,This is the first satellite system ever compete with high speed broadband and fiber. It‚Äôs low latency is mind blowing for what it is.
2714,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't compete with fiber optic
2715,qs2QcycggWU,"So glad I stumbled across this. I had no idea the degree of complexity Starlink employed. This is some of the best instructive animation I‚Äôve come across, excellent work. Thanks!"
2716,qs2QcycggWU,"What is dishy sending to satellite?
Can dishy send a img as a data to satellite and what will satellite do with the img?"
2717,qs2QcycggWU,Satellite just received the ones and zeros and then transmits them to a ground station which then sends the information requested back to the satellite and back to you at home
2718,qs2QcycggWU,"This might be too much to ask, but remembering back to physics 3 in college.  Wouldnt the magnetic field be rotating about the axis of the current but in the opposote direction.  Satisfying the right hand rule of thumb. Lets say we were looking straight into the flow of current where the current was flowing in the direction of our eyes, wouldnt the magnetic field be rotating counter clockwise?"
2719,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much sir for your packaged information & LOVE YOU SIR.
2720,qs2QcycggWU,"The most simplified explanation I have ever seen. Mind blew.
I am curious to know how satellites have all info?"
2721,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this incredible video. It's crazy how we get used to technology. I never thought about how ""Dishy"" would work. But here I am, watching this video, which are H.264 encoded frames, that were sent from a satellite."
2722,qs2QcycggWU,Really H.264? For me the video is in AV1. Google pushes hard against obsolete proprietary codecs. It is using them only for backward compatibility with old devices.
2723,qs2QcycggWU,"the algorithm used in singal adjustment process algorithm is open source , if yes could anyone provide the link ."
2724,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool!
2725,qs2QcycggWU,"While the tech explanation is good and all. Any insights on the risk of collision, decommissioning, space debris and max satellites at 550km low orbit? Starlink's plan to lauch 40000+ satellites seemed like a space grab that squeeze out any potential competitor and seems like a tool for the all seeing eye."
2726,qs2QcycggWU,"The satellites have ion thrusters on them to avoid collisions, and for decommissioning they'll just burn up in Earth's atmosphere."
2727,qs2QcycggWU,good
2728,qs2QcycggWU,I'm feeling lucky to live in this era
2729,qs2QcycggWU,"The way they figured out how to form beams and do all of this blows my mind.  It is also wild to be that we are constantly fighting each other as a species, but there are some amongst us that are so focused and intelligent that they‚Äôre pushing us forward into the future."
2730,qs2QcycggWU,"You think starlink isn't a weapon? ü§£üòÇü§£
Dude, get real.  Don't even consider the cost of engineering this system, just go with the physical properties.
These are supposed to be used to bring internet to ""under developed"" (without internet) areas, right?  Well ""under developed "" areas tend to not have a bunch of extra $ on their hands. 
But before they could turn the first penny of profit they had to launch hundreds of these satellites into orbit.  Then ship out a receiver dish to each individual customer.
How much do you think all those satellites and receivers cost?  And that's all before getting the first customer.
And you think that's another business venture buly spaceman Elon? It never occurred to you that this whole idea could never even recoup the startup costs, let alone turn a profit?
You're watching this video, so obviously you have some interest in the starlink system. But that obvious flaw never crossed your radar?
So naive and trusting"
2731,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you. I got answers I was wondering in my life. I keep searching for ""Satellite"" these days. What is new tech coming in 2023?"
2732,qs2QcycggWU,Naturally watching this on Starlink Roam :)
2733,qs2QcycggWU,StarLink =  SkyNet.          And then just add the AI Elon is building.             Once it goes live itll wipe out everyone just like in the movie terminator
2734,qs2QcycggWU,or wall-e
2735,qs2QcycggWU,"so well explained, thanks!"
2736,qs2QcycggWU,Microwave is 2.45 gigahertz‚Ä¶. And this emits 12? Does that mean we can‚Äôt be anywhere near it while it operates?
2737,qs2QcycggWU,Well you wouldn't want to be near the satellite but that's a couple miles in the air.  It's perfectly safe to stand around the dish.
2738,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for this work
2739,qs2QcycggWU,"I definitely didn't expect the Starlink be so complicated, and visuals are great! Thanks you!"
2740,qs2QcycggWU,It doesnt work - they installed all the towers during lockdown to fake it working.
2741,qs2QcycggWU,It does work.
2742,qs2QcycggWU,amazingü§Ø
2743,qs2QcycggWU,fantastic as usual
2744,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!!!
2745,qs2QcycggWU,"The insane scale of complexity blows my mind, and the animation alone really is easy to follow, even with these number of details shoved into my brain."
2746,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Awesome
2747,qs2QcycggWU,this concept is very old...... i wish they will get into FFT in this process also...... BF is also used in cell towers
2748,qs2QcycggWU,I don‚Äôt know where i would even begin to start researching a topic like this in detail. I am extremely impressed and hope to achieve a creation of a similar video to this one day.
2749,qs2QcycggWU,A comment is needed
2750,qs2QcycggWU,THANKS FOR THIS üòäüòä
2751,qs2QcycggWU,i have learnt more in this video than my college lecture.
2752,qs2QcycggWU,Some neighbor near me is having slowest starlink internet! May because of a signal booster???
2753,qs2QcycggWU,Nice visual explained. Best way of learning.
2754,qs2QcycggWU,So basically it works like the new radar in the nose of the f35.  Wont take long to dissect this one.
2755,qs2QcycggWU,"hahha there is no satellites exists
it is all at the bottom of the sea under water fibre optic cables transmitting onto a cell tower transmitter
earth spinning there is no way satellites can spin on its own"
2756,qs2QcycggWU,Grow up kiddo. Trolling is lame.
2757,qs2QcycggWU,Can this be used in the surrounding countries/islands surrounding the us?
2758,qs2QcycggWU,Yes it's available in any country that approves it
2759,qs2QcycggWU,E
2760,qs2QcycggWU,Great job. Very fascinating. Very detailed and technical but not too complicated to where you couldn't understand. It had just the right amount of information.
2761,qs2QcycggWU,Does the dish have to adjust frequency for Doppler shift since the satellite is moving at a high speed? Doesn't the frequency increase as the satellite approaches and the frequency decrease as the satellite moves away? Sort of like how the sound of a vehicle passing by on the road changes pitch?
2762,qs2QcycggWU,This video blew my mind. Thanks so much!!

2853,qs2QcycggWU,"Two way, Satellite tracking technology is not anything that new, but the refinement in Starlink avoiding moving parts certainly makes it interesting.   The way it switches between different satellites and being able to act like the same connection is quite interesting. 
Your video is really good, it goes into great details and explains it all well.   I would argue that it is complex, rather than complicated.   The principles are not complicated, but the antenna systems is complex :)     Thanks for the video."

2906,qs2QcycggWU,How would this version of dishy work on a moving vehicle or boat?  Would the GPS in the dish constantly update as it moves so that all is good?

2908,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm 51 years old, so my bachelor's in applied mathematics/physics was a long time ago.  Turns out, I had other interests after university.  So, I never properly used my degree and as my dad used to say, ""use it or lose it"".  But I suppose that's not quite true since this video brought much of it flooding back (E&M, for example).

How much bandwidth are those arrays capable of, and how do they have time to beam at each one?"
2938,qs2QcycggWU,"Crappy, really crappy lol, Also your lord and savior musk is raising your prices and taking your mobility away. LOL musk,  useless vapoware salesman with no common sense. Your better off using your phone quite frankly. I use cellular and get 500Mbs down and 100Mbs up. LOLlink, gets what maybe 25 down thats the best I have seen on over 30 different people using it."

And it is a consensus amongst seafarers that, with proper use, internet will create more positive feelings. I hope,this starlink will soon be available in cargo vessels."
2946,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't.
2947,qs2QcycggWU,nice
2948,qs2QcycggWU,great
2949,qs2QcycggWU,Intrest
2950,qs2QcycggWU,goodbye star gazing. this is sad
2951,qs2QcycggWU,This is Insane Loved it soo much
2952,qs2QcycggWU,I can't sleep now knowing all the technology going on in our dishy that sits directly above our heads on the roof. Amazing video and graphics. Thank you!
2953,qs2QcycggWU,Dem
2954,qs2QcycggWU,What a time to be alive!
2955,qs2QcycggWU,"Nobody and nothing goes into ""outer space"" as described. It's scientificly and geometrically impossible."
2956,qs2QcycggWU,Can you elaborate?
2957,qs2QcycggWU,"@@hobogrifter Geometrically impossible: Orbital telemetry is based on the radius value of the earth being 3959 miles. They need the R value for the ""orbital"" telemetry. Scientificly: We have gas pressure on earth. It's 14.7 psi at sea level. The necessary anticedant for gas pressure is a solid container. Gravity doesn't contain gas pressure. If you want to know more about it, just ask but some folks get super freaked out about this discussion about their belief system. Thanks for asking. Be well."
2958,qs2QcycggWU,@@hobogrifter The radius value being 3959 miles has been debunked thousands of times. Outer space travel is a science fiction belief system that was literally started from science fiction stories.
2959,qs2QcycggWU,"‚Äã@@slow-mo_moonbuggy Explain to me kiddo, why there is pressure gradient in atmosphere when you  go up;)"
2960,qs2QcycggWU,@@slow-mo_moonbuggy Secondly why I can track every Starlink satellite with my telescope? Why it is always where site says it should be?
2961,qs2QcycggWU,@@tgstudio85 A gas pressure gradient requires a solid container. Provide a citation of a physical experiment of gas pressure without a container. I'll wait.
2962,qs2QcycggWU,@@tgstudio85 Still waiting. Surely you should be able to quickly locate that citation. Another pretender clown bot boy.
2963,qs2QcycggWU,"This is all magical how it works.  We've come a long way from dits and dashes on a telegraph wire.

Thank you for showing us this fascinating technology."
2964,qs2QcycggWU,"Surely the plagiarising commies have already acquired pieces of these equipment and  were able to reverse engineer them, making some innovations and voila, make another good business!"
2965,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, tech!"
2966,qs2QcycggWU,"While not exactly an electronics engineer myself, I am still really impressed at the level of detail you go into with each aspect of the technology whilst maintaining an excellent level of clarity throughout. Bloody impressive. Both the technology and this presentation of it. Credit: Rex Lucas - I plagiarised your text..."
2967,qs2QcycggWU,"It is amazing how everything we take for granted is loaded with deep layers of systems, history and science. I can't wrap my head around everything that was explained but I am in awe of all the solutions brilliant engineers have come up with to solve these complex problems. And thanks to this channel, we get a peak behind the curtains. Truly astounding!"
2968,qs2QcycggWU,Your video is always quality
2969,qs2QcycggWU,"you are really doing great work by serving this best education ,god bless you,thanks."
2970,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, even their satellite dishes are super complicated and I love it."
2971,qs2QcycggWU,It's the first time I'VE seen a video suggest to speed up the video XD I was going to do it either way at 1.25x but yeah.
2972,qs2QcycggWU,"Ahh, the antenna array works like a crystal latticeüòÖ"
2973,qs2QcycggWU,More free advertising for Elon Musk. Fucking cheap ass bastard.
2974,qs2QcycggWU,"It crazy how at the end of the day, our modern world works because of a force of nature that we can manipulate, but still don't understand-- namely electro-magnetism and its movement."
2975,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm so Disappointed and Upset that I've Never known about this channel, Luckily this video popped up in my suggestions.
I Don't think I've Ever seen such an Amazingly Beautiful Video on such a complex subject. The Graphics, The Simplistic Explanations, The ability to cut through the fat and make such a concise video that makes perfect sense and the Fact that Even more info was put in the Closed Captions (Canadian) is Next Level!
This Channel creates videos that Huge Media Companies would spend Tons of Money on with a Team of Hundreds of Employees and still wouldn't come close.
This channel should be Mandatory Viewing in schools and Funded by the Department of Education or something similar!"
2976,qs2QcycggWU,And they say there are no ALIENS in space! All this technology came from ALIENS!
2977,qs2QcycggWU,So does it independently function on its own solar power for offgrids? Or is it expected to run plugged in to energy source?
2978,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful and information video üé• ‚òÑÔ∏è
2979,qs2QcycggWU,awesome
2980,qs2QcycggWU,Unbelievable episode. Perfect.
2981,qs2QcycggWU,"In 3:27 of this video says more than 10,000 satellites are in the space right now. But try to google to prove he is wrong. Then how can I continue watching it, if don't took a good research about this?"
2982,qs2QcycggWU,Best Detailed Video
2983,qs2QcycggWU,"The best so far. So simple, yet so complex. Magnificent work!"

2990,qs2QcycggWU,"I read that ""phased array"" is used for the monstrous 5G weapons planted beside schools, hospitals, health clinics, and houses. And it penetrates human and animal bodies, and is deadly."
2991,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, thanks!"
2992,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content and your ability to keep it highly technical yet easily grasped. Thx!

2999,qs2QcycggWU,"BS, satalites in ""space"" don't exist, they can'tget past the firmament. They are called sataloons. NASA is the biggest consumer of helium and there are giant balloons carrying these satalites."
3000,qs2QcycggWU,"Kiddo, you seriously think that low level trolling will do?"
3001,qs2QcycggWU,"@@tgstudio85 Still waiting for the citation of a physical experiment of a gas pressure gradient without a container. Maybe Professor Dave has a video showing that. Oh that's right, he doesn't."

3010,qs2QcycggWU,This is really very interesting...
3011,qs2QcycggWU,"2 Qs..first: does it not affects the aerospace or an aircrafts..because with these very very high frequencies could it be possible that it could affects the signalling system or whatever term they used for an airship to travel safely?
second: how about in tropical places on earth or mostly in a sunny days where heat is too much for a device to get overheat..does one model for a specific country fits to all?"
3012,qs2QcycggWU,"Just a curious question.. Does having more than 1 dish amplifies the internet speed since it'll have more antennas? Let's say if I have 100 Starlink dishes interconnected to each other, and theoretically the Starlink router can handle it, will the speed then be 100x?"

3027,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic explanation.
3028,qs2QcycggWU,"Is there any evidence that Elon Musk was actually born on Earth, and not sent to us from an advanced civilization either outside of the solar system or in the future? We can only hope that the motive is to save us."
3029,qs2QcycggWU,Is it weird that I understood everything that was shown and discussed?
3030,qs2QcycggWU,excellent video

It's all about application, which is where I feel universities need to do more of, I'm guessing that's  why there are Masters and PhD programs

Finally also understand why upload speed sucks, hopeful for future technologies that will access that"
3065,qs2QcycggWU,These waves heatup the environment and effects on human health or any other species birds honey bees etc
3066,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate the effort you guys put into allowing us to learn such amazing things without brain breaking research!!
3067,qs2QcycggWU,this was amazing info....thanks
3068,qs2QcycggWU,How does this technology perform during weather disturbances and solar storms?
3069,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing in depth description and very easy to understand. Well done. liked, subscribed and commented to help the channel to create more of these üôå"
3070,qs2QcycggWU,Very impressive  graphics and simplified descriptions. I can see why it took months to produce!

3077,qs2QcycggWU,This is an incredible opportunity for students to learn more about this kind of technology. Thank you for the high level of quality and work.
3078,qs2QcycggWU,Great animation and explanation - enjoyed the video and got the summarized view of this amazing technological advancement.
3079,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is amazing!
3080,qs2QcycggWU,"Just wow, super cool technology decomposition"
3081,qs2QcycggWU,"A single satellite doesn't make sense, it makes sense if a group of satellites communicate between each other to adapt to the dishy's field of range when one satellite leaves and another comes in contact. Secondly, the satellite should also communicate with the data centers through satellite dishes to connect to the internet servers."
3082,qs2QcycggWU,"I dont know if this is to impress given the complication, but it will surely be expensive frim the given info only on the capital and operational expenses itself"
3083,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology. It makes the price of the hardware seem like a great value.
3084,qs2QcycggWU,TLDR: Not that well
3085,qs2QcycggWU,is it harmful if exposed longterm with these types of dishes?
3086,qs2QcycggWU,üëçüëç
3087,qs2QcycggWU,"Does that work even with supertyphoon? And just like wifi router, you cant carry it anywhere, meaning I can only use internet using starlink in a specific location?"
3088,qs2QcycggWU,I miss electronic engineering üò¢
3089,qs2QcycggWU,Good work üëç

3092,qs2QcycggWU,"Bullshit, satellites are just balloons."
3093,qs2QcycggWU,How about if cloudy or rainy wheather the performance is affected?
3094,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool stupidy mind-blowing crazier fantasy video!
3095,qs2QcycggWU,"you could've summarized all of this explanation in one simple sentence : ""it will be expensive for ordinay people."""
3096,qs2QcycggWU,"Great balance of technical accuracy and accessible narration on the topic combined with tremendously helpful animation, kudos"
3097,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome videoüëè
3098,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, This is the residential Dishy I assume? Is there a video about the Dishy used for the Business solution? The High Performance Dish? I believe this connects to multiple Satellites at any point in time? How many built in antennas do the business Dishy's come with?"
3099,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome!!!
3100,qs2QcycggWU,"how it connects to the data center, does each satellite having a connection between each"
3101,qs2QcycggWU,Quite incredible actually. It reveals just how much of a genius Musk is.
3102,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.  wonderful
3103,qs2QcycggWU,This technology has been there for over 80 years but still amazing

3117,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
3118,qs2QcycggWU,Finally a real world application of what I learnt in University. This is brilliant!
3119,qs2QcycggWU,The problem is‚Ä¶.  The people building it are untrustworthy.  If you wanna put people like this between you and your data.  Good luck
3120,qs2QcycggWU,comment
3121,qs2QcycggWU,"Wao awesome, also explains why upload speeds are sub-par via the dishy üëç"
3122,qs2QcycggWU,"Very impressive video, great job! As a PhD student working on metamaterials and transmission array antenna, I want to make one minor correction. At around 7 min 30 seconds, the video mentions that the electrons are pushed to the patch antenna. This is technically not true. The displacement currrent formed between the feeding line and the patch antenna is created by the oscillating electric field instead of physical movement of electrons. I know it is hard to explian displacement current to general audiance, but physical movement of electrons means surface plasmon, it can only be true for very small antennas under the optical frequency (surface plasmon resonance)."
3123,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work
3124,qs2QcycggWU,This is a whole semester!
3125,qs2QcycggWU,Love this.
3126,qs2QcycggWU,All of this engineering and design so we can watch porn in the woods.

3133,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing and i totally understood. A very well made video describing how Starlink worksüëç
3134,qs2QcycggWU,"It's fascinating how these patterns of constructive and destructive interference act as a bunch of mirrors, allowing the main beam to exit thru. I was on the edge of clarity when my neuron receptors went off phase and stopped firing!"
3135,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm really grateful to everyone working on such material, it makes it really easy and interesting to understand!"
3136,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much üòÅ. What a fantastic detailed video it was ‚ù§Ô∏è. Just loved it!!!
3137,qs2QcycggWU,"What an incredible video. The animation alone is crazy, liked and subbed !"
3138,qs2QcycggWU,"Coolest thing about it, Elon restricted Ukraines use of it so they can‚Äôt use it to attack anything on Russian soil kicking off WW3, which seems to be what Zelensky wants along with a never ending supply of our money."
3139,qs2QcycggWU,"Bullshit,  their satelloons in the dome earth is flat! Space is a lie."
3140,qs2QcycggWU,I was mind blown!
3141,qs2QcycggWU,It works coz the Russians are still letting it slide and havent shot them down yet and disabled them thats how Starlink works üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ üí™üá∑üá∫

3150,qs2QcycggWU,NERDish........
3151,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this video. You have really answered a good part of my questions. I am wondering what protocols are used between the parabola and the satellite. Is there any  specific format? Is it new protocols ? Which layer in the OSI model ?
3152,qs2QcycggWU,"Not 10,000 in orbit more like 4,000"
3153,qs2QcycggWU,Why not show the geostationary satellite near 2:08 properly?
3154,qs2QcycggWU,Chinese engineer desperately watch this video
3155,qs2QcycggWU,There are 26 shooting stars in the video :D . The Insane technology and incredible way of presentation of explaining it all.
3156,qs2QcycggWU,Wow seems like postmortem of technology's .
3157,qs2QcycggWU,Good job.
3158,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing ! Salute to those who created this vidoe and research. I love Science!
3159,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
3160,qs2QcycggWU,very interesting
3161,qs2QcycggWU,This is a video video man
3162,qs2QcycggWU,"It also works on Planes, ships and Rv's."
3163,qs2QcycggWU,It does not magically work. If you're a Christian or an idiot who doesn't believe in science or technology then it's magic. But if there are some rules you have to follow to get it done then you can get it done with hard working money. Not through little pixies or fairies or giant asshole of a God sitting in some distance sky.
3164,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine half the human population ever born was intelligent enough to create this kind of technology. We would be travelling to other galaxy by now or who know what else.
3165,qs2QcycggWU,Yea thats the way it should be and it is fantastic üéâ. I am a layman but I understood the entire aspect and I am excited. Want to know more. Thanks.

3190,qs2QcycggWU,Soooo at what point do we start orbiting way too many satellites? I mean that looks like a complete mess to have that 10k starlink satellites intertwining around the globe. What happens when the next company wants to put 20k satellites in LEO? Pioneers get the dibs?

3202,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful work!  You just got another subscriber.
3203,qs2QcycggWU,It's  over  my Head!!
3204,qs2QcycggWU,I was already wowed by starlink.  Now I am amazed.
3205,qs2QcycggWU,It seems live around earth orbit  will get you even faster internet.
3206,qs2QcycggWU,Super cool and not that hard at all.  Thanks!
3207,qs2QcycggWU,Just gorgeous!
3208,qs2QcycggWU,It was üëç
3209,qs2QcycggWU,Wrong all signals come from phone towers or submarine cables under sea no such thing as satellite
3210,qs2QcycggWU,Electronics is crazy. Nice engineering video.
3211,qs2QcycggWU,Loved the video. Thanks!
3212,qs2QcycggWU,How does it change direction of the waves to point to the satellite while also changing the wave length to sent specific bits of data? won‚Äôt the change in wavelength for sending data affect the positioning of the beam?
3213,qs2QcycggWU,Of course this video blowed my mind!!! Love it and thanks for the ton of work you've put in to make this understandable ! üôå
3214,qs2QcycggWU,Idk why i am commenting but you deserve what you asked
3215,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive. I am a long retired electronics engineer and found this video as clear and compelling an explanation of a complex system as one might find by a truly gifted instructor.
3216,qs2QcycggWU,"excellent video, thank you"
3217,qs2QcycggWU,Was this narrated by an AI voice? Just curious
3218,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes mind blown, liked, subscribed, and commented! lol"
3219,qs2QcycggWU,üòçüòçüòç
3220,qs2QcycggWU,"more like drones or weather balloons , satellites do not exist. the temperatures these things are supposedly flying at would melt them."
3221,qs2QcycggWU,it's a scam.
3222,qs2QcycggWU,"Confusingly awesome, seems the guys that upgraded this aren't from earth"
3223,qs2QcycggWU,Very complicated
3224,qs2QcycggWU,"ok this is probably the most sophisticated topic for me, my respect to the people that make it happen and take time to apply this in the real world."
3225,qs2QcycggWU,"OMG, i already love electronics but maaaan, this is literally the best video explanation of a topic that i ever seen. Glad to have found this channel"
3226,qs2QcycggWU,"Rather silly concept.  94% of the planet is uninhabited. 80% of the rest is already covered by fiber.  The remainder is mostly too remote and too poor to afford satellite internet.   Then there's the inefficiencies:  the satellites are idle for 97% of their orbits, yet they only last for like 4 years, so they get very little use, probably not enough to even pay for themselves.  Even Elon says Starlink 1 is marginal.  I would not put any money into this."
3227,qs2QcycggWU,like learning a pc when first out for sale. new words too use
3228,qs2QcycggWU,This is an AMAZING video and end to end explanation of everything works! Very well done!!!

I have one minor quibble. It is rather easy to see the effects of phased signals - but at light frequencies. All you need is a laser, a beam splitter and a few mirrors."

3237,qs2QcycggWU,"simply mindboggling, the material, the explanation, the animations all top notch. Looking forward to more stuff like this"
3238,qs2QcycggWU,"Oh brother. You lost my faith that you would be factual. The ""regular"" sat TV satellites do not orbit at all. They are geostationary."
3239,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative, I feel like a star link engineer right now"

3243,qs2QcycggWU,So can the system track the satellites to provide an uninterrupted stream if Dishy is not on a fixed point?  E.g. on a moving vessel at sea?
3244,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work!!! Top level stuffüëå
3245,qs2QcycggWU,How does it determine to send which data to where or how does dishy only read the data that is sent for them only?
3246,qs2QcycggWU,A lovely blend of existing technologies. Also a lovely accessible explanation of phased array which I knew of from military radar but had never pondered.
3247,qs2QcycggWU,"If my Physics, Mathematics and Computer teachers used such animations to explain concepts then we would have so many STEM students in the world. So easy to understand for someone who has ABSOLUTELY no background in STEM subjects. Being a software programmer I totally applaud the detail in the video."
3248,qs2QcycggWU,I wish I had real life applications like this while at school I would have take wave propagation much more seriously rather than bare minimum only.
3249,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent, is there a video for how satellites work on this channel?"
3250,qs2QcycggWU,Ooh my God this is explicit details... well explained at every step not forgetting the outstanding animation üëè... I wonder what tool was used to create these animations.ü§î any ideas üí°? On the tool?

3258,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!!!!
3259,qs2QcycggWU,"Judgeing by the high latency and the poor sound transmission as well as the high buffering, Starlink is not worth the expense!"
3260,qs2QcycggWU,I'm honestly just commenting because you asked for it and I want to support you :)
3261,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work, well cause of sun stuff it works with 40 less satellites."
3262,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video. My mind is blown.
3263,qs2QcycggWU,Amazeballs
3264,qs2QcycggWU,Simply mind-boggling!
3265,qs2QcycggWU,How does someone even figure something like this out
3266,qs2QcycggWU,I'm blown away by the complexity of this antenna and the whole Starlink technology.  Branch Education does a great job explaining this to the common people.  Thanks.
3267,qs2QcycggWU,If Star Link was flying around a round and spinning Earth don't you think you would lose your signal after it fly's away from your location and is now being blocked by the round Earth.
3268,qs2QcycggWU,I can assure you that the Star Link satellite is hanging from a weather balloon way higher than the storm clouds where there's no wind.    It gets launched and goes up and then once it's way past the altitude of any clouds it just hangs there for years and doesn't move because there's no wind.    The Earth is Flat and Stationary and Immovable.     Elon Musk will need to send a new Star Link satellite up to a high altitude once the old one becomes obsolete or wears out.     That's all it is Folks.    All satellites are hanging from a weather balloon.    Do not accept the Lies.      It says in the Holy Bible that SATAN will try to Deceive us.    There's no space.    We live under a Firmament that GOD created and there's no way to get past it.
3269,qs2QcycggWU,amazing. i am not doing shit professionally compared to this ‚Ä¶

3275,qs2QcycggWU,I am not a techie but honestly I am quite impressed and a bit overawed. This is very well researched video that is presented in a manner that even  novices like I can appreciate the complexity and genius behind Starlink technology. Good job!
3276,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating üññ Very well presented and educational.  The graphics are excellent. Thanks. üëç
3277,qs2QcycggWU,I owned a home theater business 25 years ago.  I first sold and installed C Band satellites. (the big 10 foot dish)  Aiming then was a big project.  To own one was owning the Cadillac of the industry.  The quality and amount of channels was considered way better than cable.  Star Link and how it works is blowing my mind.  Having it continually changing between moving satellites without even a blip in signal or having to move and recalibrate is amazing.  In the last 10 years I was a consultant traveling all over the US and I would sit on the plane wondering how that flat disk less than 3 feet in diameter on top of the place is picking up a signal so good when where I lived an 8 foot stationary dish was marginal. I know digital signals helped. Towards the end of my business I was selling Dish Network and Direct TV but to track on a moving vehicle going 500 MPH blew my mind.  Now it is completely mind boggling.  You explanation is great.  It is so captivating.  You go into just enough detail.  THANK YOU.
3278,qs2QcycggWU,amazing explanation üëçüëç
3279,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent Work!
3280,qs2QcycggWU,"okay, hold on. 20:53 - why is there a need to recalculate every few microseconds to facilitate precise beamforming towards the Satellite? don't these Starlink Satellites travel in a predictable orbital path? once that relationship between Dishy's coordinates and its assigned Starlink Satellite's Orbital Positioning has been established, isn't that already predictable?"
3281,qs2QcycggWU,"The coordinates of the satellite is definitely well known,  it's just the phase shifts to get the proper beam forming angle needs to be recalculated, and distributed through the pcb."
3282,qs2QcycggWU,This is extremely helpful as we welcome starlink to Nigeria
3283,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You. Very insightful.
3284,qs2QcycggWU,How does the use of phase shifting to encode the data impact the phase shifting used for beam forming and direction?
3285,qs2QcycggWU,My background is in electronic engineering. I've watched thousands of YouTube videos and I've never seen a more professionally made and complete video as this one. Just enough detail to not be overwhelming but complete enough to get the thought across. Excellent.
3286,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is kinda cool
3287,qs2QcycggWU,üëç Absolutely agree.  I was able to follow everything as explained.  Graphics helped tremendously. üòé

As someone who does a little post production for a hobie I like knowing the process and time it take to make these kinds of video's. Great job! Thankyou Youtube Algorithm for this.
3291,qs2QcycggWU,Idk
3292,qs2QcycggWU,"H.264 encoding is used from the latest military drones, but they don't beam-form.  Higher QAMs are used in all digital communications, from cell phones, to cable modems and DSL over telephone lines.  H.264 compresses the digital signals to fit the more important data in more bits, and the redundant data in fewer bits.  I am retired now, but had a fascinating career working with all of these.  I started with IBM 360 assembly language programming, and ending up working on a 256 processor chip.  It was great!"

3329,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, it is clear how much work went into this and that work paid off"
3330,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi and thanks for the video, Starlink is truely an amazing technology, in Seychelles where I live, Internet is like a luxury and our providers whilst they promote their internet tend to lie to people's faces and a lot of people are quite gullible or simply may not understand, our biggest problem is internet speed and its painfully slow for several providers, they only offer faster speeds for people who sign up for capped internet and those packages are not good in my book. Another provider Cable and Wireless has released some other packages whilst faster and call it unlimited lite or unlimited ......, it's really not, they give up to 30GB per day for the more expensive package, and around 20GB per day for  cheapest plus any unused data is none transferable to the next day, it's a rip off and if we give it several years and evolution in technology working with internet such as gaming these data caps would be largely  insufficient, I have enough of those BS and patiently waiting for Starlink operations to commence in Seychelles, I believe the speeds would be way way better than our providers local offerings."

3338,qs2QcycggWU,Stell.mal so ein ding hier hin ich sag dir was man besser machen kann
3339,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink satellite internet work? IT FUCKING DOESN'T.
3340,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work here in Oklahoma? It works GREAT. I have had Starlink service since 2021 and it has been great even from the start in its ""Test"" phase. The first year we had a few service lapses for a few seconds every day, never noticed if you were streaming video so I had to look up the info to even know I had a lapse in service. Now, we only get interruptions in service for a few seconds each month. I even get service during stormy weather with only a few exceptions for a few seconds every year now. So I am 100% satisfied with service and you can even travel with a satellite on your RV or boat. I highly recommend Starlink."

3372,qs2QcycggWU,its just creazy how good you created this video <3
3373,qs2QcycggWU,this is a very interesting explanation! Thanks a lot!!! I was looking for information how exactly electromagnetic waves can be done and now I easily learnt it in a few seconds!!! I also understood how to stear the wave-beam using the interferences and the phase-shifts in each antennas. So thank you so much!
3374,qs2QcycggWU,Bullcrap there are no Satelittes that float around our heads in space EXCEPT weather balloned devices.  Lol  the starlink satelitte is  a hig fat lie. The dish is simply picking up GROUND BASE SIGNALS.
3375,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, Thx"
3376,qs2QcycggWU,watching how does starlink work is cool since im connected to my new starlink i just hooked up.

3384,qs2QcycggWU,"Instead of moving it just have multiple and remove the motors have a alot of ground satellite üõ∞  ,this way we only use wireless and manual change of which can receive which field of wave. Who am i. Any way why do hard than make it simple,and signals work better in a calm environment less heat wave can improve signal."

3390,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the educational video
3391,qs2QcycggWU,"they say 20ms on starlink
but ive had it since day one years ago and its never been 20.
20 to the dish in orbit maybe.... but the internet isnt actually in space theyre relay dishes, so 40 is the absolute minimum.
the sats are more like ""mirrors"" between the home dish and a relay station on the ground."

I am very interested in hearing how the Starlink satellite works, particularly how the satellites relay information through the constellation to later hit a ground station(s) and connect to the terrestrial network. I would also like to hear about how lasers (using light for data transfer in the vacuum of space) get used for connections between satellites."

3458,qs2QcycggWU,"The only thing I didn't understand is how Phase Shifting can be used both to steer the Beam and to arrange bits in that grid, at the same time. Don't they conflict with each other?"
3459,qs2QcycggWU,"They all ground based, like 99.9% of data and communication is transferred over sea cables. They can't charge you that much if you know everything about the mainframe. Their vendors and work partners are key. People believe they can see satellites with their naked eye, but no one sees any satellite pass by the moon with their telescope. The idea that their size is small is a narrative that is false because of that. Are their naked eyes stronger than any telescope? No, nobody sees satellites like flies passing by the moon. Only the ISS is visible while transiting the moon, but that is another story. People only observe what they are told to."
3460,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video.
3461,qs2QcycggWU,Good
3462,qs2QcycggWU,"This was a wonderful presentation. I am a physics masters, and so loved to see the application of electrodynamics. I marvelled at engineering to apply the physics behind. However, having said that, your presentation and commentary in explaining the complications is par excellence."

3466,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
3467,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank u for your kind information and the 3d demonstration is obviously pretty good.

3468,qs2QcycggWU,"Good job
And thanks for this awesome video"
3469,qs2QcycggWU,This is an excellent well articulated learning stuff. Kudos!!!!!!! Thank you.
3470,qs2QcycggWU,I always wondering how much power does Starlink Satellite require? Is it enough power with just solar panel?
3471,qs2QcycggWU,"No, hence they need to charge and turn off systems every now and then to get battery back.

Technically there is more with the group of satellites since they are swapping between each other as well as sending signals to one another.

Mechanically, starlink is costly to maintain outside of just making more of them and launching into space.

Technically you need a medium rocket launcher to get those systems up there though (which also require engineers)"
3472,qs2QcycggWU,very much informatic video which have a brilliant explanation.
3473,qs2QcycggWU,Just amazing. So m any concepts super simplified and demystiffied
3474,qs2QcycggWU,"Please get the basics correct. Satellites orbit in the same direction Earth rotates, which is west to east, and should have been counter-clockwise in the videos. Geostationary satellites do not zoom around the planet; they orbit at the same rate Earth rotates taking them 24 hours to make one orbit. Hence they are geostationary. They do not beam TV signals; they transmit digital data, some of which is video."
3475,qs2QcycggWU,"As a video producer/editor working to bring complexity in another academic field to the people, the quality of the presentation here is truly jaw-dropping! The fun part is this tech is what allows me to do my job at all."
3476,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! Astonishing technology, pity there have been no studies showing 5G does not cause harmful effects to humans or the environment.

It's a disgrace the way it's being rolled out! Pharmaceutical companies would not be allowed to introduce a new drug without extensive testing. Greed is the only reason for rolling out this technology as fast as possible. 

Big deal being able to download and watch a movie on a smart phone. Who wants to watch a movie on a smart phone anyway?

What little research has been done consistently shows harmful effects to living organisms. Why is it this research is being ignored? Money the root of all evil."
3477,qs2QcycggWU,I counted 15 stars. Am I right or did i miss something?

3481,qs2QcycggWU,"this is crazy, thank you for you're videos"
3482,qs2QcycggWU,It was just WOW! The best and deep dive tech content for this topic I've seen. Great job!
3483,qs2QcycggWU,"Since we use phase differences to differentiate between symbols being sent or received, how is phase differences even used for focusing signals in a particular direction? Wouldn't changing phases to steer signals also change the symbols being sent?"

3499,qs2QcycggWU,Why Does not  American government create system machine for destroying satellites of Putin war if they can . That can make Ukraine reach the winning as soon . We need to know exactly where Russia satellites go. I think this could do it . We need punch up space wide for check and do.

3539,qs2QcycggWU,"If the phase of the signal is used both for directing the beam and encoding the content, how do these 2 processes not mess each other up? That's the only part I struggle to understand, everything else is brilliantly explained."

3541,qs2QcycggWU,I wondered about that also.... time to do some research!
3542,qs2QcycggWU,"well no the phase itself does not have an influence on direction, it is the difference in phase positions or in other words the phase shift that steers the beam. So all the antanes have the same phase frequency but a different phase shift. Remember, shifting a phase only changes the delay (when it hits top or bottom) of the wave and not the actual speed or frequency of it."

3546,qs2QcycggWU,"Goodman natural disasters of all kinds including human. We desperately need an emergency communication system. I would like to see a network infrastructure. Which used the existing level to commercial channel, part of the GPS specification, riding over the top of it with a non-interfering coding. A very low bandwidth. But data channel. That could be received by every handset built in the last decade. As they currently process the L2C channel. For some additional reach, tuning the satellite, but information wise it's largely unused. So the correct coding cannot interfere. Take this broadcast signal that for standards reasons and interoperability reasons among 10 decades of cell phones built. Will all receive the same broadcast channel. So every handset around the world will receive it. Consider that every cell phone tower. Is booming out its signal at a strength That is strong enough to reach low earth orbit plus much more. So as every starlink satellite passes through the cell tower transmission. It takes the text messages and drops them into the L2C channel. That every handset will receive, drop it into a circular buffer, and when unique, pass it up the text message stack. We're all current social applications, for legacy reasons still support their initial transport of text messages. So that's the downlink outbound channel. And the uplink is any handset that sends a text message. Because that too will be likely with some probability to be received by one of the circling starlinks. And And then down linked broadcast using the L2C, where consider this a basketball team, where you want every player to touch the ball at least once. And once the player sees his own text again. It knows that it's been reliably received everywhere. Latency is terrible, bandwidth is miserable. But it's measurable and durable and anti-fragile. And all from to addresses are unique, as assigned and ranges by the ITU. So attribution of the sender is guaranteed. Which makes this effectively a parallel party line in text messages to every handset around the world. Where in every handset the social applications work using compatible, for legacy purposes  text message service, making every handset its own server for all of its applications that are text-based. Think Twitter and Facebook. Where are the handset can retain a month or a year's worth of text messages, even more if #selected. Which devolves to a series of from phone numbers to filter. So given every handset is its own server for every application that can run on only text messages. In the clear or not. But if not there's a horrendous key management problem, and legacy compatibility issues. Wherefore most social networks, privacy can't be guaranteed about the best you can do is integrity. Which is more than enough for human to human communication. And there's just not that much texting in terms of bandwidth needed, or number of messages per evond around the world. Gigabytes, not terabytes of  weeks if not months of text messages. Where in actual use only post of the last month are of any utility. And if you really want a database search or a large content. You can go find a high bandwidth network. But in the interim you fall back to the old equivalent of telexes. Which the world used to run on without any problem. Certainly enough to manage any transaction related function. And now that everyone knows all the from tos"

3563,qs2QcycggWU,"Colossal work! (I work in the film industry)

Very accurate tech descriptions, even with simplifications. Such a joy to watch an array previously flown only on air superiority fighter jets now used for civilian internet connectivity!"
3564,qs2QcycggWU,Would you mind repeating that.
3565,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you.
3566,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Great video!!!
3567,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind blowing! Please continue your great work!
3568,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting but what happens to people and animals birds if they get in the way of all of those condensed waves
3569,qs2QcycggWU,I love those animations!!!!
3570,qs2QcycggWU,comment done
3571,qs2QcycggWU,"Something ALL of you fools should ask yourself is this.......   We know that NOTHING can remain up there , regardless of height, unless it has propulsion, and propulsion requires replaceable FUEL ..... but NON of these pretend satellites HAVE PROPULSION.....and neither do they return to earth for refuelling , so why are YOU so easily fooled with all this fake science......and WHY are you so easily fooled every time another idiot tells you that "" We have to show you this in CGI and other make believe horse shit BECAUSE WE CANNOT SHOW IT IF IT DOESN'T EXIST IN REALITY.""   Stupid is as stupid does.....But you are NOT ALONE in this fantasy....Even Trump believes this garbage so you are in good company....but there again Trump believes they landed on the Moon  AND.....He also told the world that the experimental graphene oxide loaded toxic injections WERE SAFE TO USE.....despite the millions of DEAD BODIES everywhere from the idiots who believed him....My guess is that YOU are just another idiot with shit for brains OR , you have taken the governments hand outs to keep this garbage  alive for a little while longer...."
3572,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually, Starlink satellites use ion engines powered by Krypton Gas. Once they run out of fuel, the satellites deorbit themselves. You can literally go to Florida and watch 60 of these things launch like twice a week."
3573,qs2QcycggWU,"so crazy how complex a simple antenna is working ... i cant believe all the physics, all the material-physics, all the mathematics, all the compuuter logics behind it ..."
3574,qs2QcycggWU,ŸÑÿß€å⁄© ÿØÿßÿ±€å ÿ®Ÿá ŸÖŸàŸÑÿß
3575,qs2QcycggWU,"Powerfull, the 3D animations make the understanding more ... question is how many satellite are used for a 24hours communication time i.e round the clock"
3576,qs2QcycggWU,well done
3577,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting
3578,qs2QcycggWU,"This was WAY over my head, yet I enjoyed seeing the complexity of such a system.
I have a very teeny tiny itsy-bitsy understanding of QAM and constellations since I dealt with it in my time in a CATV/Internet digital headend, but in no way fully understand it."
3579,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video
3580,qs2QcycggWU,amazing!! and please tell me more more more!
3581,qs2QcycggWU,this is amazing thankd for your vidoe
3582,qs2QcycggWU,I was so much excited of the presentation quality of this video. I would definitely subscribe this channel with notifications on ‚ù§
3583,qs2QcycggWU,"Had  Elon  bend a Black  South African  people would be burning Teslas on the streets for what he has done with Tweeter,,."
3584,qs2QcycggWU,"Studying this in a course is one thing and seeing it with such a good animation of a real usecase is completely different thing. Thanks for making such videos, I am sure lot of effort goes into this."
3585,qs2QcycggWU,But you may agree on that both course level work as well as this type of high level presentations are worth?  One of my concerns is that my son wishes he could do away with university without realising that even E. Musk completed his undergraduate degrees in physics and economics.  Good day
3586,qs2QcycggWU,"@@richardacevedo280 Don't get me wrong. If I have to choose one of them I will always go with University studies. This helped me recollect what l learnt, making me feel good."
3587,qs2QcycggWU,@@muttarameshchandraprem1478 you cannot learn if you cannot visualize yourself in your head
3588,qs2QcycggWU,"@@richardacevedo280 I have a BA in Applied Math And a BS in Computer Science. I too am concerned with the discussion of limiting the math, science and arts to focus on just building electronic devices. The arts do more to push the math and science than anything. An education is a ""total mental"" experience!"
3589,qs2QcycggWU,"Had  Elon  bend a Black  South African  people would be burning Teslas on the streets for what he has done with Tweeter,,."
3590,qs2QcycggWU,"exactly, it is far easier to learn this way, such as an intelligent child could understand."
3591,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, still lost me in parts as it takes good concentration levels to go with the flow.
@Mutta Ramesh Chandra Prem Seeing such good animation is one thing but understanding the heavy math behind it is a completely different thing."
3592,qs2QcycggWU,Great video thanks for the information.
3593,qs2QcycggWU,thank you so much for this video its so informing im a telecom student i needed this thank you again
3594,qs2QcycggWU,"This is amazing, the amount of time and resources that went into this production of this video is mind blowing"
3595,qs2QcycggWU,"20,000 Mbps 2000 Mb/s 300,000 Kb/s multi and unique network since they give us bad service they should improve internet servers and force private companies with strict and fair laws for an internet that functions and 100 percent 24/7 I know they don't care because they are already old but there are young people who think to improve everything like me too who make chips with more power in downloads of 1000 MB/s megabyte per second and 600,000 megabits per second multiple unique in telecommunications we go far back to Spain technology is advancing and you are falling behind chip arm 1000 power + price econ√≥mic"
3596,qs2QcycggWU,It's too bad Starlink needs an inordinate amount of ground stations. People in chink town could have actually had free access to information for a change. But I guess appeasing ching a ling gov is more important.
3597,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done
3598,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video.  One question that it seems to pose though: isn't the phase and amplitude modulation process used to encode the symbols the same one used to steer the beam?  If so, how can the symbols be encoded without knocking the beam off course?"
3599,qs2QcycggWU,I wish  everyone could imagine technology like this in the future in their mind without the need of videos but with just verbal descriptions imagination is so cool
3600,qs2QcycggWU,balloons
3601,qs2QcycggWU,This must be the best explanation of radio frequency communication especially for someone without a signal processing or EE background. Can you do a video diving into specifically the RF communication fundamentals?
3602,qs2QcycggWU,Really mind blowing content and visualization ü§©

3612,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Subscribed!
3613,qs2QcycggWU,"I have been amazed by what i've seen on this channel multiple times and you always go out of your way to explain everything in a way thats easy to understand way that makes so much sense. I enjoy your videos and usally watch through the entire video. Thank you for your insane dedication to this channel, cant wait to learn more from you."
3614,qs2QcycggWU,I will love to learn more
3615,qs2QcycggWU,"Huge shame. In no time, these satellites will become obsolete but the pollution will remain. Musk is a clown"
3616,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing. Innovative
3617,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible details.
Thanks for the research."
3618,qs2QcycggWU,Good thing Musk is not a songwriter having to title songs!
3619,qs2QcycggWU,Does this still use the cables under the water????
3620,qs2QcycggWU,No
3621,qs2QcycggWU,"As some one just watching this and trying to understand, I give up lol.  Dam."

3623,qs2QcycggWU,"I‚Äôll join in applauding how well this video explains in an easily understandable and well presented way the complexity of the Starlink system. The dialog, graphics, and writing are superb, far better presented than I could could accomplish - and I teach SATCOMS Engineering classes !! WELL DONE !"
3624,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Great content
3625,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Great content
3626,qs2QcycggWU,"22:20 Liked the video, Subscribed & now Commented.
Fantastic Easy & In-depth Explanation With Great Animation. How Good this video is, is just mind-blowing!!! 
Keep making these kinds of videos."
3627,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant video, thanks"
3628,qs2QcycggWU,Question if I'm in the middle of Australia how does it keep connected while the train of satellites is on the other side of the planet üåéü§î
3629,qs2QcycggWU,Because there are thousands of satellites so there will always be one overhead.
3630,qs2QcycggWU,Every time I watch a video like this... I'm reminded how dumb I am. Don't know how these people have enough time in their lives to learn all of this information.
3631,qs2QcycggWU,This video is amazing!!!!
3632,qs2QcycggWU,starlinks and shit
3633,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, I love this informative video, thank you"
3634,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing detail, BUT I really would like to explore a different aspect.  How many devices supported at any given time by each satellite?"
3635,qs2QcycggWU,Globally SpaceX recently passed 1 million active users and sends up 54 new satellites every week to increase coverage and bandwidth. Each StarLink satellite has 16 beams and can serve 2000+ users.
3636,qs2QcycggWU,"As always, just amazing content. Thanks a lot for your work!"
3637,qs2QcycggWU,Good. Video
3638,qs2QcycggWU,Just we can make something change at 13ghz is insane...

3643,qs2QcycggWU,So Starlink sends everything Base64 encoded?
3644,qs2QcycggWU,Totally awesome look inside of the technology. Thank you very much for the video.

I genuinely have no idea how you guys do this so well but just wow. You explain it so understandably.. I don't think there is a channel with anything near the quality and clarity as the videos you guys do. So yeah, all I can say is thank you very very much."
3661,qs2QcycggWU,insane
3662,qs2QcycggWU,"I've never seen beam forming explained so quickly, simply, and succinctly. You guys have an amazing channel and 2 million views hardly seems like enough. xD"
3663,qs2QcycggWU,"Hey, First of all thanks for this  masterpiece . My question isn't spesificly about Starlink but about general internet. What happens when the satellite receives 2 or more signals at the same time? And to seperate and identify users does it use the frequency distrubition technique as well as cellular towers?"
3664,qs2QcycggWU,"What an advanced technology!
Small chips and 2 cm antennas communicating 550 km while we are having hard times to connect 3-5 km away cell phone towers üòÖ.

Great video and explanation.

Please do more. Thanks a lot."

3671,qs2QcycggWU,very good
3672,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this through Starlink!
3673,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful
3674,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome
3675,qs2QcycggWU,Wow üëçüèΩ thankyou
3676,qs2QcycggWU,"It is interesting that this antenna tech is probably about 40 years old. First use? Military, ofc. Early warning, aquisition and later aircraft radars."
3677,qs2QcycggWU,In depth study made it easier for us to understand
3678,qs2QcycggWU,excellent learning as a senior citizen not understanding this technology thank you I have subscribed
3679,qs2QcycggWU,Very well explained! Simply excellent.

3683,qs2QcycggWU,"Perfect video, thanks, exciting time to live."
3684,qs2QcycggWU,jus wondering that if single dish can hear multiple satellites at same time and it is phase array antenna. In theory it can do up stream simultanously to multiple satellites and that way use even less  airtime.
3685,qs2QcycggWU,Doesn't exist.
3686,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, so amazing! Thank you very much for your hard work! Verry well put together and accurate informations about this subject! Subscribed, liked and commented, because I can't get enough of watching your videos! This is so amazing! I remember when I used to study Electronics and Telecommunications in the University, and I can say that my teachers weren't able to reach this level of detail and clarity you go into these videos! Please keep up the good work! Now I can confidently say that I've better understood how antennas and this technology work! Science and technology is so fascinating!"
3687,qs2QcycggWU,Very educational made easy to comprehend! Amazing graphics! Thank you so much!
3688,qs2QcycggWU,Well done

3696,qs2QcycggWU,"This is mind blowing, tears almost roll down my eye tears of excitement... I wanna say thank you to the engineer for their great minds and ultimately thank you to God for blessings of great minds."
3697,qs2QcycggWU,"This technology is used to hack humans brains via BCI, RNM and V2K technologies. Elon Musk is a front man for DARPA and high up military. They use this technology to zap people into committing crimes so they can take away the 2nd amendment. They ZAPPED BLM so hard that they were murdering people on the streets. It's not healthy technology like it's being spun to you all. Please wake up!"
3698,qs2QcycggWU,"Please keep doing this kind of videos, this is gold content, thanks!"
3699,qs2QcycggWU,"Here comes your role, to explain such a interesting topic in interesting way"
3700,qs2QcycggWU,"Am amazed, even i understood what was going on, wow, this video is a masterpiece, that is for sure. Great Work, you inspire me."
3701,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown
3702,qs2QcycggWU,Very Insteresting i love science i always had  a curiocity to know  things i love star and i think elon musk is a geniuos for doing the starlink and all tecnology like tesla  since it hyas internet and starlink send signal he will have everybodys info
3703,qs2QcycggWU,Damn! Freakin Amazing.

3707,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off!
3708,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video ,anybody here have starlink broadband? And would they recommend it"
3709,qs2QcycggWU,yes my mind was blown. I'm so darn glad I had a bowl of ice cream ( ahhh:rocky road...thank you very much ) with me while faintly listening to some Lead Zeppelin in the background. Great info...thanks man!
3710,qs2QcycggWU,Get enough of them placed by the buyers can create a lot of feature to which the creators are seeking. So many events can be in from this itself and it‚Äôs given by those who pay for it. Both sides get the perks but which ones weighs right for the processes in which we all take part in. Love it in it‚Äôs complicated simplicity in all forms of intentions.
3711,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely mindblowing! Thank you so much! Hope to see more videos like this.
3712,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. :O
3713,qs2QcycggWU,fourier transformation basically
3714,qs2QcycggWU,I clapped in front of strangers. This is the most accurate looking animation accompanied by excellent explanation. Thanks you team.
3715,qs2QcycggWU,At satellite at 35000kms would be geostationary and not rotating around the earth like in your animation
3716,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
3717,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
3718,qs2QcycggWU,"9:30 i dont understand, normaly, when current runs from + to -  theres an electric field going from minus to plus and likewisde there is also created a magnetic field perpeendiculare to it, whats the differance between that with just a wire and this? what sperarates the 2, why are they different."
3719,qs2QcycggWU,"It's all cool and all, but the fact is that there'd be massive data caps and/or it would be very expensive to maintain and operate."
3720,qs2QcycggWU,"I feel like star link is incredibly stupid (this content however is incrediblyamazing), littering the night sky with satellites which makes studying the stars difficult. There's already so much space junk up there and they want to add SO much more. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
3721,qs2QcycggWU,i hope this isnt an ai making youtube videos to finance the future takeover of the superior intelligence
3722,qs2QcycggWU,honestly one of the best channels on youtube right now fr
3723,qs2QcycggWU,I hope the hackers turn that antenna into AESA radar and share the project to us.
3724,qs2QcycggWU,Dudee that beam stearing mechanism is awesome... How do people come up with this sort of things.... Mannn these people really are something...!!

3729,qs2QcycggWU,"Liked, subscribed, and now commented. Love the beam steering animations!!! Very educational."
3730,qs2QcycggWU,Great production. Can you make one on Government corruption and how to solve for PI.
3731,qs2QcycggWU,I'm glad the technology we have today and the technology that allowed us to develop today's things was not available during WW2 look at all weaponry that was developed from those engineers especially Germany they were decades ahead of every one else.
3732,qs2QcycggWU,"I was a Microwave electronics technician working in the industry building Microwave amplifiers in the KU band back in the 1980s... Microwaves are magic, Thanks to James Clerk Maxwell, Thompson, Oersted, Weber, Henry, Faraday, Lenz, Heaviside and Hertz who were the pioneers."
3733,qs2QcycggWU,Were those a bunch of paid replies? You guys all sound way too impressed. ‚Ä¶ Bunch of fucking musk bots.üòÖ
3734,qs2QcycggWU,very informative!
3735,qs2QcycggWU,"I know I sound like an echo here, but this was insanely quality production of the highest degree. The narrated content was incredibly cohesive, clear and easy to understand but the visual 3D animation deserves recognition in it's own right.

Would you kindly tell me what software, team, or company you used to construct the visual content? I would like to put together a quality explainer video like this for a project I'm working on and don't prefer the cartoonist version which seems to be so very popular"
3736,qs2QcycggWU,"Not certain, but it looks very much like Blender, which is free and open source.  And that's awesome!"
3737,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome explanation! Incredible technology
3738,qs2QcycggWU,2
3739,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow well explained, learned one thing and was satisfied. Why dishy doesn't rotate. About all else went over my head"
3740,qs2QcycggWU,you deserve more the like and comment thank you very much from an engineer
3741,qs2QcycggWU,amazing  lesson
3742,qs2QcycggWU,"hey that is very very detailed, well down 
but can I challenge you to do 10-50! antena just as powerful as Starlink's?
i know there are 1300 antennas glued together but I've always wondered if it's possible to just make 1 of them , just 1 as a challenge for DIY if we could really make a similar  or maybe even better starlink dish, can u do that ? from the looks of it 1-10 antenna doesn't sound to be that hard, we could even do it with the extra materials laying around the garage."
3743,qs2QcycggWU,"One antenna would be great, but as mentioned in the video, you would need motors to redirect the signal beam. Using multiple antennas as transmitters, a directional beam is formed electronically without any moving parts. That is the magic of phased-array antennas üì° ."
3744,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 try 2-10 then :D 
it should be an easy DIY ^^"
3745,qs2QcycggWU,if you succeded then you could multiply it later but that would be  very nice video to watch hence I don't have time to do it myself.
3746,qs2QcycggWU,wonderful‚ù§
3747,qs2QcycggWU,Tweakers find out avout all that copper and them dishys gonna be w the catalytic converters

3749,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this on starlink from a rental cabin and I‚Äôm the only one in the group who thinks it‚Äôs mind blowing that this cabin has starlink
3750,qs2QcycggWU,I find phased array technology incredibly impressive and this video is the perfect explanation and animation of how this tech works.
3751,qs2QcycggWU,"Insane Technology!

3765,qs2QcycggWU,"I was wondering if there are any health issues associated with using this technology?  I live in Alaska and was thinking of getting this to use as the phone towers are not reliable as there are only 1 in our area. Also concerned about the health issues having a router in our home as the signal can cause dizziness, nasia, heart palpitations, migraines, among other issues. Just not sure about if it would be right for us . Will have to think on it before but I really enjoyed the expiration and the tech is cool."
3766,qs2QcycggWU,"The spectrum these antennas operate on are too low powered do any harm.
I doubt your router can cause any of the stuff you mentioned."
3767,qs2QcycggWU,"How much is the monthly fee, equipments and installation fees?"
3768,qs2QcycggWU,Initial cost of $599 and service cost of $110 (charged per month). No installation cost unless you want to mount it professionally to your roof. Then you're dealing with an installation cost and the need to buy a roof mount.

3794,qs2QcycggWU,"You said that dishy is only able to produce a single beam directed to a particular satellite , so it raised a few questions.
How dishy choose the best satellite to connect to and  how do it switch from one to another , while maintaining a stable connection ?"
3795,qs2QcycggWU,"The position of the dish and adjacent Starlink satellites are constantly  being monitored and evaluated, along with the angle of the beam from the dish to the current Starlink satellite. When the right thresholds are reached, the connection is handed off to the next satellite. I'm just guessing, but believe this happens in the same manner as when someone is driving down the freeway talking on their cell phone. After every few miles or so, the current cell phone tower hands-off the connection to the next tower. This is all done via sophisticated software which works between the cell phone towers, a central processing facility and the cell phone connecting to the towers. The Starlink system works in a similar manner, substituting satellites for the cell phone towers. It's even more complicated though, since the thousands of satellites are orbiting around the Earth, unlike fixed cell-phone towers. Nevertheless, the brilliant software programs manage this complex technical dancing üíÉ maneuver in real time."
3796,qs2QcycggWU,Explaining how a Starlink dish switches between satellites would be a great idea for the next Brilliant video.
3797,qs2QcycggWU,How many people with degrees in gender studies did it take to figure all of this out and produce the satellites

3867,qs2QcycggWU,"This must be an ad because what starlink is doing isn't new or special. There are other sat internet providers who has been doing this waaay before starlink. Starlink is merely an option now, and not the best one, niether to the costumer nor the environment. Some other companies use 3 satellites to do what starlink need 10 of thousands to do. The binge time is the only advantage the starlink has since their sats are closer to orbit but that's not something worth the massive negatives that comes with it. Elon is a force of evil and hopefully people will open their eyes to see him for what he is."
3868,qs2QcycggWU,"lol, the enviroment? what species are you trying to protect 500km up in space? low earth orbit satellites not only have better latency, they are more reliable and have better local coverage. non of the companies you are thinking of have the capabilities of starlink, like being jam resistant to Russian radio jammers. it is absolutely the best option with people who can only get satellite internet, how else would they gain 400,000 customers in a year? people like you are a force of evil, you tear down good men doing things no one else has."

3888,qs2QcycggWU,"Informative Video.

However I have 2 questions.

1. Phase modulation between antennas is done to form the directional wavefront. Will changing phase to encode bits will not have an effect on wavefront formation?

2. While explaining single antenna, it was said that they can work as either upload or download link at an instance. However later on it was said that simultaneous upload and download communication take place between satellite and the dish. How simultaneous communication is achieved? Does some antennas work as sender and receiver at the same time? Will it not affect the wavefront formation?

Thank You"
3889,qs2QcycggWU,"In the video, bar charts and several explanations show how the sending/receiving works concurrently, but not simultaneously. The dish works in receive-mode for most of a given time slot, then flips to send-mode, just like two people talking over a phone. Since communicating works the same way for both sending and receiving data, the same circuitry can be utilized, just in reverse direction. This is all explained in the video... I'll need to watch it a few more times myself to get all the details. In computer networking,  alternating between sending and receiving is known as 'half-duplex,' while simultaneous sending/receiving is called 'full duplex' data transmission. So, the Starlink antenna works in half-duplex mode.

For encoding data into the QAM bits while performing the beam forming, I'll need to research how that functions. The narrator briefly explained that, but by the end of the video my mind was already exploding.... hehehe ü§™."
3890,qs2QcycggWU,"Not sure, but when the narrator mentions 'simultaneous' sending and receiving, he meant concurrent data transmission, like two people talking over a phone line. Hence, the Starlink antenna can alternately send/receive data, albeit not simultaneously, unlike full-duplex Ethernet connections."

3945,qs2QcycggWU,üßê üëç
3946,qs2QcycggWU,"So, Is it just one (1) starlink satellite revolving around the earth to cater (send/receive signal) for all ( I expect increasing) the satellite disks?"
3947,qs2QcycggWU,"No, thousands. 3500 right now with plans to go to 13000 and then further plans to go to 42000"
3948,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for preesenting this .
3949,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is a   Proyect military. the face of elon is asiatic, in Sud√°frica  the people is very black or very White, this eyes CHINESE."
3950,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, I am a Electronic and communication engineer I can understand the concepts that you told in this video and I am amazed by your graphic and explanation. I really appreciate your work and thank you for giving good knowledge to the new generations in the world. Keep going"
3951,qs2QcycggWU,"Okay Dishy, you are my friend now."
3952,qs2QcycggWU,"All that to watch porn.
Amazing."
3953,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is quality! Can't believe it's free!
3954,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
3955,qs2QcycggWU,The first video I saw from you guys was about the smoke alarm. Then the computer ram was suggested. Took a look at your profile and you gained a subscriber. Really nice job compared to other videos
3956,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!
3957,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind - Blown ü§Ø Such details in each step, makes it want to learn the not known aspects."
3958,qs2QcycggWU,great video indeed. instant sub üòä
3959,qs2QcycggWU,"I am not qualified nearly enough to comment on the deep functions of this technology. BUT!! PEOPLE!!! back off the ""wows"", ""way cool""s enough to actually LOOK at what this technology represents!!  Tied with many multiples of terrabyte memory it is a potential freaking nightmare of total, penultimate control of each and every human being on the planet!!! Individually. This video is nothing less than the detailed blueprint of the 1984 plot!!  SOMEONE is intensely working on this stuff every minute of every day. The next step is tying this to AI.    We're dead ... already ... and just are too stupid to know it!!"
3960,qs2QcycggWU,OMG soobscribble
3961,qs2QcycggWU,The content is exhaustive for a regular youtube viewer. But it's definitely a learning platform for an engineering enthusiasts. Keep up the good work Branch.Education.
3962,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video however I have one question. Presumably a singly starlink satellite is recieving input from hundreds/thousands of dishys on the ground at the same time.  This video explains how it works between one dishy on the ground and one starlink satellite, but how does it prevent the data from the signals of 1000+ dishys getting mixed up ? And also how does it transmit the data to thousands of dishys that are in different locations? thanks"
3963,qs2QcycggWU,THIS IS THE BEST EXPLANATION EVER ! üòÅ
3964,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is great work.
3965,qs2QcycggWU,What a wonderful technology
3966,qs2QcycggWU,"Given there are already almost 5K comments, someone probably already pointed his out. At 2:09 the Geo television satellite should be shown orbiting at the same rotational speed as the earth."
3967,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative and high quality content! Thank for your efforts in the video.
3968,qs2QcycggWU,comment to supportüëç
3969,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely fascinating.  Great job making an incredibly complex technology more understandable.
3970,qs2QcycggWU,really informative one.
3971,qs2QcycggWU,This will f*up birds life
3972,qs2QcycggWU,No place to hide.
3973,qs2QcycggWU,"As I already have high speed fibre internet I had never seriously considered taking up Starlink but I remember thinking, ""Yikes, $400 just for a dish!""
Thanks for the info in this video, I now think, ""Wow, ONLY $400 for that dish!"" Should I ever move to an area with poor to none internet I will feel much happier to pay the upfront costs of Starlink."
3974,qs2QcycggWU,Fuck starlink.
3975,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
3976,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video. Well done!
3977,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation
3978,qs2QcycggWU,ü§Ø
3979,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome content! Dence and clear information! Is there some particular beaming issue in receiving mode? It is clear that when transmitting, antenna array need to ""steer"" the beam but what about receiving? Is there some mecanisme that need to be taking in account to amplify the signal? Or do we only need one antenna out of the array to receive signal?"
3980,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn I can't imagine having to model and animate all this like bro how painful is that and btw I counted  11 shooting stars, also I really appreciate this video and am very astonished on how sophisticated things can get on a small scale"
3981,qs2QcycggWU,awesome explanation
3982,qs2QcycggWU,"I did not hear anything mentioned about how it is limited with speeds because the more users you have the slower it will be as it has to communicate to all the users in an area. so it has limitations, but it is still very cool. figure out how many satelites it would take to provide internet to every person on the planet and have full speeds for service... would there be such a massive amount of them needed that a launch of a rocket to high orbit would have a high risk of hitting one on its way past them? would the destruction of one by a meteorite cause a chain reaction of destruction of all the satelites at this point of saturation to provide everyone with internet? lets not forget about other companies sending up satelites as well... Amazon is sending 3,236 Project Kuiper satellites into orbit, dunno what distance those will be, but the sky is getting crowded pretty fast"
3983,qs2QcycggWU,I would want to understand about communication between multiple satellite and constellation management
3984,qs2QcycggWU,Who exsist that can possibly understand any of this vid
3985,qs2QcycggWU,Laymansterms plz
3986,qs2QcycggWU,Hit me up?
3987,qs2QcycggWU,These bastards have us all in the dark
3988,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for simplifying this. Even though i dont fully understand, i think i get it. I‚Äôm a navigator at heart and dream of sailing the world. Therefore my question, would Starlink work mounted to a sail boat? Like on a gimble? So it would mostly point up. Internet on a boat is extremely expensive. Maybe Starlink is as well. I just stumbled across this video. Anyway just a thought‚Ä¶ thank you"
3989,qs2QcycggWU,27k km/h is bullshit...
3990,qs2QcycggWU,"this is a fantastic video, very well explained. I finally understand these complicated concepts which I'd expect to learn on a degree!"
3991,qs2QcycggWU,"I think I would have done much better back in school if we had videos like this, as I'm a very visual person.
I can't even imagine how long it would take me to absorb all that information reading it in a book or listening to a teacher trying to explain it.
Thank you to all of you that contributed to this and other videos like it."
3992,qs2QcycggWU,"Educational systems everywhere- globally speaking, are absolute garbage dumpsterfires that are built on crooked groundworks with crooked understanding of knowledge and crooked misconceptions on what methods are best to relay this knowledge... Oh yeah, and they're also currently saturated to the brim with politics.

Stay away from them and question everything you ever ""learned"" if it came from a school."
3993,qs2QcycggWU,Same here. A teacher could repeat the same thing over and over for a month and I would still have questions but show me a diagram and I'm done.
3994,qs2QcycggWU,"Liked, subscribed and here's the comment (:"
3995,qs2QcycggWU,It's very good knowledge !

4007,qs2QcycggWU,"This is by faar the most well documented video that I saw on youtube. Amaizing job, the same as the Musk`s antena."
4008,qs2QcycggWU,Very good job explaining how it works
4009,qs2QcycggWU,What a load of. BS
4010,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are really amazing.

4023,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant Invention but is this allowed to revolve in the airspace of other countries?
4024,qs2QcycggWU,This is really fanastic way to learn the workings of complex technologies
4025,qs2QcycggWU,11-13ghz .. isnt that licensed band ?
4026,qs2QcycggWU,Very well delivered video. I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer so I was amazed by the details shown in videos. Generally very few videos in the internet give so much detailing (well technically obviously there is a lot lot lot more is going on and cant be explained in such short video). I liked it. Keep the good work going and let the info coming üòÄüëç
4027,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
4028,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent work but the title has little to do with the content title ""How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work?"" The title should be more like ""How Beam Forming can punch through a radio beam to an orbiting Satellite. The big picture is you are transmitting a stream of data from the ground source and a receiving a stream of data from the satellite. Traditionally, a strand of copper wire does the same thing. 
Here are some of my questions
Is the bandwidth of the signal 64 bits or six as show in the video
In radar, you use the term duty cycle. You listen for data and send data. I suppose you could grab one byte of data and then switch, but assume you would grab 1k of data and then switch modes
You might discuss the concept of modulation where the data is mixed with the carrier. You mention PM or Pulse Modulation and AM Amplitude Modulation, why both ?
Each satellite maintains a session with several dishes at once. I wonder how each satellite can switch(listen,transmit) between each dish on the ground? I would guess each session has a 64 bit ID
I wonder about how each session is started and ended. Eventually a dish gets out of range or in range, how is continuity of session maintained ? 
I know there are lots of satellites. But I wonder how susceptible the satellites are to jamming or DDOS Distributed Denial of Service attacks ?

Again, great work on those antenna arrays. The graphics are especially useful."
4029,qs2QcycggWU,That is so cool what scientists were able to think through and actually also produce!
4030,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a masterstroke. I wish something like this was shown in my digital signals processing class!
4031,qs2QcycggWU,The architecture and infrastructure for the digital prison technocracy ahead of us being marveled at. I guess the guillotine was similarly admired in it's day.
4032,qs2QcycggWU,Incredibly well done educational video

4051,qs2QcycggWU,It‚Äôs harder than one thinks.
4052,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of the video and this explanation is unheard of!!!
4053,qs2QcycggWU,"I have been using a StarLink system for about 6 months. I love it for speed but it does have brief outages during Zoom calls and streaming films. The video is truly amazing, incredible and Brilliant. The complexity of the concept and design of the StarLink is mind boggling. I've never seen such a well designed video explaining such a complex subject so well executed. Kudos to all involved. Thank you."
4054,qs2QcycggWU,"Great explanation. However, the animation has several disturbing errors, like it shows traditional TV satellite to orbit earth, while it stays at a fixed position."
4055,qs2QcycggWU,Did you get your award
4056,qs2QcycggWU,Same way as it doesn't.
4057,qs2QcycggWU,Also they were 7 shooting stars üå† I counted them while watching the videos .....

4093,qs2QcycggWU,My view: Internet is nothing but connectivity but here the connections made using awesome engineering of radio frequency through satellite.
4094,qs2QcycggWU,"Antenna engineering is a whole 'nother field of electrical engineering. At Purdue, I looked at the math and said I am not worthy. Then ending up needing it my whole career, LOL.
Years later I met the fellow that invented the phased locked loop used here in places. We used to swap books; that was like as good as it got back then for entertainment. The TV screen was inside our head. He read about 5 to my one. Anyway, he worked on the radar used in the bomber in WW2. The PLL is why we were so accurate. Back in the day, every 'good' radio had a circuit called 'selectivity and sensitivity' whose function was to be sensitive to certain frequency and less sensitive to all others. That allowed you to 'tune in' to a station. Back then, everything also started by making a crystal vibrate ( interacting with a physical object and colliding it with a physical reaction from a separate source) Same thing here. I am reminded and thrilled to see the same physics applied in new ways and that there is nothing new under the sun. Today, crystals are 'grown', back then they were actually hand cut. And because, they were sold in 'sizes'. That mattered because it took power to tune. less vibration meant you needed more power to move it.
The brilliance are they use man's combined knowledge to do some incredible. Again, bravo Elon."
4095,qs2QcycggWU,Antenna engineering borders on magic. So many variables to consider.
4096,qs2QcycggWU,great explanations!!
4097,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, but where do you buy it or rent it or whatever to be able to hook to it?"

4103,qs2QcycggWU,it hurts to hear a voice like that telling us the biggest lie which one human may hear without getting electroshock all over the senses! BRO...IMPOSSIBLE FAIRY TALE FOR BABIES 1-8 HOURS OLD!
4104,qs2QcycggWU,"Totally understandable, just like: 

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or a deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.

In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.

The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."
4105,qs2QcycggWU,"Honestly, it's a great way to connect through the internet but, the monthly cost is, well, expensive to be honest"

4115,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice!  but , and maybe I missed, How do you convine the phase shift signal to angle de bean and at the same time change to the according phase  to send the value you want to send? It uses phase change to angle the bean and change the phase to change the value of the info send."
4116,qs2QcycggWU,"I also do not usually comment, but I needed to express how impressed I am by the depth and quality of your content. Too many other educational videos take specific technologies for face value and don‚Äôt go much deeper than surface level.

4179,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing explanation and visuals, complex equations in the simplest form.for the first time i saw the full 28min without skipping(hmm well i skipped Brilliant promo 16:26 to 16:52). content has been well narrated, the monotone of the narrator was cool and less dramatic as it should be during class room. such an advance feet Starlink has achieved in tech in broadband propagation worldwide.  
I wonder if they can be the masters of our world as not they can beam in and out huge data. Low orbit satellites could be a threat to a nation wish SpaceX never gets into any kind of military agreements. Oneweb is picking up but concerns are always there..

4184,qs2QcycggWU,Won't the abundance of satellites cause issues with planes or rockets in the future?
4185,qs2QcycggWU,The motors only move the dish during initial setup?!? How am I only now learning this?!
4186,qs2QcycggWU,"The amount of brain power it took to design and build this technology is staggering. The problem is the education standards for today's children has  devolved to such lows that they will not be able to conceptualize or construct such magnificent things like this in the future.

4193,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off to the geniuses that figured this out. Mind is blown!
4194,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing. Literally mind-blowing. Hats of to the engineers making this a reality and hats of to you guys making us understand that it was not as simple as most of us had imagined ü§¶

4197,qs2QcycggWU,Love ur video. Gave it a like. In a parallel life am a Scientist.
4198,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool. Very interesting process.
4199,qs2QcycggWU,"I am very curious about two things:

1. Does not using phase encoding to carry data interfere with using phase change to form the beam front?  Wouldn‚Äôt the beam tremble around with the data it is carrying?  Maybe it is just an issue of scale: the beam-forming phase change occurs over a few minutes while the data-encoding phase change occurs over a few nanoseconds.

2. There are 10,000 satellites, and millions of subscribers.  I assume the mechanics of a satellite‚Äôs onboard antenna-array are roughly analogous to that of the ground station‚Äôs, but how does one satellite conduct hundreds or thousands of conversations at once?

Beautiful work on the script and animations."

4205,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting
4206,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely cool to watch! I've been working with RF and SATCOM for a while, and it was interesting to see the tech being employed specifically by Starlink. It's interesting to see how they were solving the insane speeds of the low orbit starlink satellites by using phased beam signal steering rather than motors, i've never seen the concept actually used. I wonder how they home in specifically on the band they need to use, does the starlink satellite emit a beacon frequency and there's a peak and pol algorithm on Dishy to lock on (multiple times a minute?) quickly? Would be cool to see how they're doing that.

Cheers! Thanks for the great video!"
4207,qs2QcycggWU,See the way this channel has demystified what looked like magic to me. Thank you so much.
4208,qs2QcycggWU,Does the starlink satellites interact with other satellites like how a normal internet would?

4263,qs2QcycggWU,"That is extremely informative content üëç üëç. Thanks a lot üëè üëè
What is still unclear for me from this video is ""phase"" concept utilization. You're mentioning that the phase shift used in order to align the beam to a satellite but also for data sending. But there is only one ""phase shift""(same for ""amplitude"") physically available for one wave, isn't? 
Therefore, is it correct to say that ""phase shifting"" is using twice? And it is like ""summing"" of 2 phases what in result gives one specific ""phase shift"" for each of the small antennas? 
DIFFERENT ""phase shift"" for each small antenna (from the array) in the first place - for a beam positioning, and a COMMON ""phase shift"" at the same time - for data encoding?
Please explain if I'm mistaken in my suggestions (as soon as I wasn't able to understand this from the video)

Thanks in advance and appreciate for the video üëçüëç 

Could you please make a similar video about antennas and signal processing from the ""satellite"" perspective. As it might be quite interesting because it serves a millions (if not to say billions) connected consumers/devices"

4290,qs2QcycggWU,"You make a great job, cool animations and very simple language."
4291,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic explanation!!!  The beam steering is based on the Starlink antenna being in a fixed known position and the knowledge of the satellites trajectories.  When installing the Starlink antenna on a drone (in order to steer it or communicate video signals), the beam steering would work no more I suppose???  Or can the GPS position and the antenna inclination of the Starlink antenna be handled as a variable???"
4292,qs2QcycggWU,One would guess the movement of the drone would tiny compared to the satellite.
4293,qs2QcycggWU,@@ohhs7830 I would guess that the lateral displacement of the drone is as you mention not that critical to compensate.  But it is it's sudden angular movements that I guess must be very difficult to compensate for?
4294,qs2QcycggWU,"SO, Will ANY Flatscreen, LCD, or LED Television that is wi-fi capable operate with this system? Or do I have to buy a new TV?"

4310,qs2QcycggWU,Hey üëã
4311,qs2QcycggWU,Well done.
4312,qs2QcycggWU,"The ACP Antenna as dissected here is missing some fundamental physics and one thing is the byproduct of this complex activity in the form of HEAT. 
For example, as you have stated--12 GHtz of current is applied thru each PCB. This results in Oscillating Electric Vectors out of which some perpendicular vectors nullify each other but a majority result in Fringing Fields. Simultaneously created Magnetic Fields point in the opposite direction. These two vectors - Electric and Magnetic  - expand in umbrella fashion...all these activities require a constant supply of high frequency current. 
For earthly application of MRI, the incoming power supply of 480 Volts is amplified by X-Y-Z gradients in thousands to create the Electromagnetic field in X-Y-Z planes for a 3D acquisition of the anatomy. For such task, there are special and additional AC coolers placed in the Gradient room and to cool off the magnet of such high calibre, the lazy gas Helium is constantly pumped on to the Nybium-Titanium components.
So, where is such high voltage current coming from in these satellites? I did not hear you address the source of such power. Is it the solar panel that will generate some power and then some internal amplifier would amplify the power to a desired level?"

4340,qs2QcycggWU,How do humans come up with something like this... this is insane!
4341,qs2QcycggWU,"Gracias, es la informacion que estava buscando, se me hizo bien dificil encontrar informacion correcta y detalladada de el funcionamiento de starlink. hay muchos videos pero ninguno ofrece informacion correcta.  hay muchos charlatanes que hacen videos caseros  mostrando como instalar una antena pero no tienen la mas minima idea de su funcionamiento."
4342,qs2QcycggWU,If the phase and amplitude changes to equal the value how does that not affect the original beam angle?
4343,qs2QcycggWU,LETS THE NEXT SOLAR FLASH BURN THEM ALL !!!!!!

4386,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation!
4387,qs2QcycggWU,"We are apathetic slaves.
This is truely a prison planet."
4388,qs2QcycggWU,"Out of curiosity, how much of a difference is there in capability between the old circular beta Dishy vs the current rectangular Dishy?"
4389,qs2QcycggWU,Tracking system and high bandwidth do to face shift.
4390,qs2QcycggWU,"I comment because your Videos are awesome and I want more of them , Thank You."
4391,qs2QcycggWU,"20:49: 16 Large chips controlling 32 front ends, each front end control 2 antennas, that's....16*32*2=1024 antennas not 1280 antennas as stated at 4:42. Why this difference ?"
4392,qs2QcycggWU,"15:00 : what is use as a mirror ? If it's an actual mirror that that's an optical communication which is not what is happening based on the patch antenna, the environment of propagation etc...

Is it PEC (metal) that is used as a mirror ? PMC ?"
4393,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you ! Great job! looking forwoard to watch more educational videos like that with this simplicity and i can imagine how hard you worked on this. You deserve many views and likes and comments. 
normally do not comment on a video"
4394,qs2QcycggWU,wooow that was so fast half an hour. Thank youüôá‚Äç‚ôÇ
4395,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
4396,qs2QcycggWU,How does a Neanderthal like me will understand this.
4397,qs2QcycggWU,4:42 : each antenna is controlled by a microchip apparently HOWEVER there are 1280 antennas for 640 SMALL microchip (3:58) which should mean that each (small) microchip is controlling TWO antennas not just a single antenna as said at 4:42 right ?
4398,qs2QcycggWU,What I don't get is how those antennas can operate if they are one on the top of the other one. The transmittion of the bottom antenna is not blocked by the top antenna ?
4399,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, Your work is awesome."
4400,qs2QcycggWU,Very good  and very descriptive. Marvellous work . Keep it up
4401,qs2QcycggWU,Super cool!

4407,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the great content.
4408,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for trying and helping a laymen understand this powerful innovation and wonders of science and technology. Beam forming itself is quite interesting  enough. How I wonder the thousand of math formulation that makes this technology exist, so precise and now I imagine such individuals  engage on such multidiscipline is quite a feat for a so called special person...mmmppphh personS....kudos and salute since time immemorial men and women devoted billions of hours in the name of progress and innovation. And to the people behind the channel we thank you for letting us see and hopefully gave us a glimpse (correction so detailed, vivid and tried to simplify it ) of the marvelous power of Starlink Satellite. More power to all of you and hopefully this innovation can help every human being to live a fruitful life but not endangering our environment and other people. Stay safe everyone. Gob bless us all."

4492,qs2QcycggWU,wow
4493,qs2QcycggWU,"I usually watch YT engineering vids at 1.5x speed but this one went deep into the physics and the animation of waveform propagation was amazing, ike most I'm not a physicist asnda these waveform propagation principles are difficult to learn in a 3 month class, so to have made it this accessible & comprehendible in a 20 minute video is just crazy.

 I had to watch this a couple times at normal speed, especially with the ""English (Canada)"" subtitles to be sure I actually understood the waveform propagations this easily & my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. 

This wouldve taken 2 semesters of classes to get to this understanding, done in 20 minutes! 

This should easily be in the running for making complex abstract principles readily accessible & comprehended. There are few in the world who can do it like this video, definitely subscribed!!  Making complex information accessible & understood by the masses is really a Holy Grail with so much information around us."

I was able to follow the physics and basic math well enough to make sense of it and actually comprehend how it works and the finesse of the manufacturing that goes into the machine precision parts of Dishy.  I find also the use of graphics and internet (distance) education takes media-aided teaching to a gestaalt, the next level of thinking.  So how do I invest in Dishy -- are you on the stock market?  :>)  Don't sell your souls to the venture capitalist market!  We need you and there are enough of us, now."

4565,qs2QcycggWU,Hahahahahahahaha
4566,qs2QcycggWU,I thought starlink satellites orbited the earth at the Earth's rotational speed to keep the same position relative to Earth's surface
4567,qs2QcycggWU,This is sooo cool! üòç
4568,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing!!
4569,qs2QcycggWU,So cool. Thanks. I studied some of this in university. My brain jumped the rails when we had to do the beam forming math. Luckily there are bigger brains than mine so someone can do it ü§™
4570,qs2QcycggWU,how does it track so quick?
4571,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow.  More information than I expected, yet there's still no mention of the control hierarchy.  Beautiful graphics.  Cheers."
4572,qs2QcycggWU,Honestly pretty genius to use a Canadian English subtitles to add more detailed notes
4573,qs2QcycggWU,This was the best educational video that I ever saw in my life!
4574,qs2QcycggWU,I have to say the video was unlike anything i watched before thanks a million
4575,qs2QcycggWU,"it's nice they want to stress this is Canadian English. But a lot less ""eh"" and ""buddy""s than I expected."
4576,qs2QcycggWU,just mindblowing tecnology and the explanation using animation were at some next level..... i am in love with this channel now.....ü§Øü§Øü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©

4581,qs2QcycggWU,I'm pretty sure that the effort put into creating this video is far more than what 90% of uni professors put into teaching a course in a whole semester.
4582,qs2QcycggWU,i studied electrical engineering but this was the best explanation I ever got
4583,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a great video, the animation is beautiful and it takes into account all the information from the teardowns. I have one picky comment about the switching from TX/RX at 10:58: If you look at the traces on the board, there is only one TRACK feeding each FEM, not a separate RX and TX tracks. I think the switching is a good explanation of that works but one would never put the switch in front of the LNA or after the PA because of degradation of Noise figure and attenuation of transmit power (maybe not that big a deal). Other than that BRAVO!"
4584,qs2QcycggWU,This was incredibleüòéüò¨
4585,qs2QcycggWU,Great video explaining thoroughly
4586,qs2QcycggWU,Jesus fucking Christ
4587,qs2QcycggWU,I love this kind of technology. i wish i could work in a place that works with all this stuff
4588,qs2QcycggWU,It was amazingly explained
4589,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for your effort
4590,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video and explanation. Now the only one question is left, is it possible to programmatically change balance of QAM (download/upload phases proportion) in the dishy?"
4591,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing explanation,, üëè the video is much  beyond other YouTube videos"
4592,qs2QcycggWU,U r amazing! Thanks for the content!
4593,qs2QcycggWU,Question: can this technology replace the cell phone techonology and disrupt companies like verizon/Tmobile etc?
4594,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks you to make this video, I was very fascinated by watching the video. üòá"
4595,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome! As an engineer, I really can appreciate how Branch has simplified such a complex concept. Didn‚Äôt  have YouTube introduction during my undergraduate Engineering courses in the late 80‚Äôs. I would have done EE instead of MechE"
4596,qs2QcycggWU,Well done man keep it up  we need more Chanel like this one
4597,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing üòçüòçüòçüòç
4598,qs2QcycggWU,If us can sabotage the pipeline so does Russia can shoot down the satellite
4599,qs2QcycggWU,Wow the technological advancement that are now publicly available is beyond comprehension
4600,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a state of art
4601,qs2QcycggWU,Comment
4602,qs2QcycggWU,great video
4603,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible channel. Love the explanations!
4604,qs2QcycggWU,"Congratulations, so impressive subject and video realisation.  

Why a constellation diagram is limited only to 64 combinations? 
Is there a kind of theoretical physical maximum transmission speed limit for this technology ?"
4605,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video.  I was wondering how they were handling the satellite tracking.  I noticed that you didn't touch on the doppler shift of the frequencies involved as the satellite tracks towards and away from Dishy.  Presumably that is managed within the transmit/receive chain.
4606,qs2QcycggWU,yeah this is useful if you're just going on facebook. however if you plan to do any serious gaming with it. forget about it. the latency would be huge. wifi isnt sent at the speed of light. its a radio signal and as such recieving this signal from space and then sending the data back would be an enormous amount of lag between server and client.
4607,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video. Well explained
4608,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, thanks for all the information shared here."
4609,qs2QcycggWU,you also explained how f16 radar works as  bonus
4610,qs2QcycggWU,thanks the concise explanation. didn't realize phased arrays can also be used for internet access. (radars have used this principle for quite a while)
4611,qs2QcycggWU,I mean every physics class needs a projector to show such things
4612,qs2QcycggWU,No Argue. This has to be paid. Too good to be free. Congratulations.
4613,qs2QcycggWU,The presentation was mind blowing
4614,qs2QcycggWU,OMG ü§Ø EXCELLENT
4615,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done - good refresher for basic electronics too.
4616,qs2QcycggWU,"LOVE LOVE LOVVVVEEE this ... I HAVE A SCIENCE DEGREE & This SPECIFIC QUESTION has been BOTHERING ME FOR MONTHS. SO GLAD YOU WENT IN DEPTH.

4620,qs2QcycggWU,"Not someone who comments on YouTube but I did want to do it this time. Appreciate the level of effort put into making this. Clear concept explanations, perfect pace and depth for me. This cleared up a lot of things for me. Thank you for making this. Very cool stuff. Subscribed! Please keep making more!"
4621,qs2QcycggWU,Superb  explanation #india
4622,qs2QcycggWU,Wow Elon Musk salute
4623,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome content, thanks for your efforts in that topic."
4624,qs2QcycggWU,great video
4625,qs2QcycggWU,"@Branch Education, what are your educational qualifications? If you want to answer. Wow superb research and content."
4626,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic video and easily understandable by a hobbiest like myself.   I only which you have of portrayed ""broadcast satellite tv"" correctly as geostationary."
4627,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, it was very well made"
4628,qs2QcycggWU,Well presented! Thank you!
4629,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing job
4630,qs2QcycggWU,Lol wtf a video recommending itself to be watched at 1.25 speed and then again at 1.5.
4631,qs2QcycggWU,"that one is some ""flat"" electromagnetic magic
no company was able to achive that, and futhermore.... deliver actual product and profit. As far as i understand, Starlink (actually it is more of Earthlink) is part of Spacex. And yeah, i don't know why, but StarShip is rather MoonShip, or SunShip max.
PS Hey explain h.265 also!!!"
4632,qs2QcycggWU,"I was able to follow along fine on first pass at 2√ó because of the Iran Air Flight 655 shootdown by the USS Vincennes in 1988. 

In the aftermath, there were _huge_ feature articles in technical publications concerning the AN/SPY-1 phased array radar system and the Aegis Combat System which controlled it. The most convincing version of the story I read at the time was that a misfeature of Aegis was the largest single component of the debacle. 

This is a long while back, but as I recall the story, this was one of the first naval radar systems which automatically linked multiple ships into a combined combat map, when possible. The design problem: before the ships link up, they separately assign numbers to each blip. After they link up, consistent numbers are assigned across the combined map. This forces some blips to suddenly change their assigned number, as perceived by the person at the console on one ship or another. I guess there was supposed to be a way to make the operator aware of these reassignment events, but in this instance it appears that the operator managed to read some parameters from before the number change and some numbers from a different blip after the number change, thinking this was all one aircraft, with the net effect being that a commercial flight that should have been going up was seen as going down, on an apparent attack profile. In addition, they had incorrect information on board about scheduled commercial flights, and a few other factors (as always) that complicated matters, one of which I think involved use of incorrect radio frequencies to contact the aircraft. 

In any case, this particular theory behind the accident drew on incredibly detailed internals of Aegis and the phased array radar system, so everything here was already familiar to me, except for the extreme miniaturization, which is nevertheless mind blowing."
4633,qs2QcycggWU,Very good pace of explaination
4634,qs2QcycggWU,How are multiple starlink dishes not clashing wavelength with each other like if 2 dishes are used side by side
4635,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Good job on the video. You simplified everything superbly. 
4636,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.
4637,qs2QcycggWU,"Gran trabajo,  ojala puedan hacer uno sobre el funcionamiento del sistema de bluetooth"
4638,qs2QcycggWU,the best!
4639,qs2QcycggWU,Very accurate explanation of QAM modulation and RF principles
4640,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you very much for this very detailed and attractively produced video.  It was also interesting (but unfortunately not explained) why the lower modules of the PCB are arranged differently, possibly for alignment purposes?
What could be improved is that the communication between the satellites and the Internet was not properly executed, that would also have been interesting."
4641,qs2QcycggWU,Great thanks for this!!
4642,qs2QcycggWU,Just blown away. Enough said
4643,qs2QcycggWU,Just blown away. Enough said

4649,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely amazing
4650,qs2QcycggWU,GREAT VIDEO !  VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND .
4651,qs2QcycggWU,No one cares about this crap technology. And who gave Elon musk rights to pollute the space with his thousands of satellites?
4652,qs2QcycggWU,There are better and simpler procedures to achieve electron streaming!!!
4653,qs2QcycggWU,Just wow!
4654,qs2QcycggWU,‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
4655,qs2QcycggWU,"1) How many dishies can one satellite handle at the same time? 
2) Is the communication to many (or even all) dishies (partly) simultaneous or is it sequentially  interleaved? 
3) Aren't there collisions due to the big transit time and different distances? 
4) Does the satellite keep track of all customer's dishies' positions? 
5) Does the starlink ""feel"" the direction of an additional dishy or is it calculated by it's GPS coordinates?"
4656,qs2QcycggWU,I had some of the same question. I had a question about jamming the satellite or intentional DDOS
4657,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!!!
4658,qs2QcycggWU,Mind successfully blown. Thank you for your time and effort !!
4659,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video thank you!
4660,qs2QcycggWU,Wow .. thanks for your efforts
4661,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing way to explaining and visualizating complex topics like this
4662,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video.Electromagnetic waves are getting too old for communications ( too slow ). same with binary communication, ( serial communication with only 1 or 0 ). Specially for long interplanetary distances is very impractical. Moving electrons is like using a hammer and a nail to communicate. There are better instantaneous ways winning Nobel prices this days."
4663,qs2QcycggWU,Great work
4664,qs2QcycggWU,One of the greatest  video having lot of information
4665,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe this video exists... Very cool!

4668,qs2QcycggWU,It was a great video explaining starlink! Thank you
4669,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent video. It has been nice to remember physics that I studied many years ago.
4670,qs2QcycggWU,"What a good job, congratulations, it's an amazing video and magistral/simplified explanations. Im curious if you could do a video explaining how a professional audio mixer works, specially the signal sampling and processing.
It would be very useful.

4681,qs2QcycggWU,There's a lot of incredibly similar comments amazed at this crock of shit.
4682,qs2QcycggWU,Why do you exist
4683,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellite Communications Tech and Network Engineer here.   Your presentation was awesome, BUT,.  Let me add some corrected detail.  The satellite for TV and other ground entry points use a satellite that is locked in a geo-synchronous orbit. Relative to the earth,  the satellite stays in the same place as the earth turns. In the animation, your satellite for the TV was in a retro grade orbit. LOL!!    With that being said,  "" I LOVED YOUR PRESENTATION!!! ""     I really enjoyed how you showed the -/+ charges moving  on the wire in tune with the voltage phase which then gets induced onto the  copper patch.  I wish my Army COBET course had this video back in 1989.   EXCELLENT JOB!!  LOVED IT!   (fix the TV satellite animation üòú)"
4684,qs2QcycggWU,Just Amazing
4685,qs2QcycggWU,How? It is cutting edge! It just takes the money out of your account and puts it into Elon's account.
4686,qs2QcycggWU,Just. Wow.
4687,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely well done! As an electrical and control systems engineer with a strong g interest in physics, I love these explanations of complex topics and, like many of my colleagues who have also noted here, I can see this in my minds eye but I struggle explaining it to others .

4697,qs2QcycggWU,"Microchips & Satelite Operation
OMG.. Shock..."
4698,qs2QcycggWU,shit all this so that I can have slightly faster internet in the country ü§£
4699,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink funding in question: Elon Musk follows "" recommendation"" of Melnyk to ""fuck off"".
Melnyk is still Ukraine's ambassador to Germany. When Elon Musk announced that he could not continue to finance Starlink on his own and demanded support from the Pentagon, he annoyed not only the Pentagon, but also the above-mentioned ambassador, who threw a hearty ""piss off"" at him. That, he said, was ""his diplomatic response"" to Elon Musk's statement. So that's the Ukrainian payoff for making Starlink available, from which the Ukrainian military in particular has benefited. Melnyk is a full-fledged fascist who worships Stepan Bandera, who was a war criminal alongside the German Wehrmacht, particularly the SS Galicia Division. He is glorified as a national hero in Ukraine. But this is nothing new. Melnyk has also called Chancellor Scholz an ""insulted liver sausage"" and in an interview denied the crimes Bandera committed in league with the Nazis. Now the German public broadcasters are weeping after this son of a jackal and almost crying when they stand up and say: ""We will miss you."" ROFL!!"
4700,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool video!
Thank you for it"
4701,qs2QcycggWU,Grasped my attention throughout the entire video. I have no prior knowledge on all this stuff but I'm always seeking to learn new information. It's pretty amazing on how advanced satellite technology is. Thank you for this. Keep it coming!

4727,qs2QcycggWU,A comment bellow.
4728,qs2QcycggWU,"Now review the numerous ground stations which host the respective satellites in view, that service the internet path from satellite to ground.  The waiting period to get your Starlink is some of the stations build out density isn't enough yet to facilitate you. While physically built, the electronics capacities aren't installed as yet. But will be, thus opening the slots necessary for your home system.

Etc etc"

4747,qs2QcycggWU,"So many comments of people being amazed but sadly, because so much BS & lies started this I hardly could write as I know I wouldn‚Äôt finish watching! Dishy flat face üòÇ, well that information may be true abt the dish but the satellite part is straight lies as there are no satellites floating in space ‚Äú& they know it‚Äù! They do get the signals from electro magnetic pulses but it‚Äôs how they get it is the trick, quite complex as they found out way back that the higher altitude bounces back the signals sent so they have a dish to send & one to receive! I hope the don‚Äôt band me üòÇ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a deeper mystery as to how though but do some research & don‚Äôt just take the regular narrative, think & view alternatively."

Having said that, a smartphone engineer may help to make these sciences. Complexity to me is illustrated by chess game, and the periodic table as a game. Compare chess and periodic table in terms of complexity. Need a measure of complexity that applies to all. Like BIPM."
4764,qs2QcycggWU,Just what I was looking for!  Keep up the good work!
4765,qs2QcycggWU,This was an awesome explanation!
4766,qs2QcycggWU,"My goodness this was actually way more info then I expected, thanks guys! Exactly what I wanted to know! like a visual and explanation that makes sense and furthers my understanding wow."
4767,qs2QcycggWU,"would u also do a video about block chain, please‚ù§"
4768,qs2QcycggWU,I love this channel‚ù§i just feel bad why i didn‚Äôt find it sooner
4769,qs2QcycggWU,Can this work in something that is moving? like a sailboat or a van?
4770,qs2QcycggWU,all of the world now are depends on  this  techniques  starlink satellite internet  because of it's consider the basic of all the informations to starting in any science projects  ...
4771,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
4772,qs2QcycggWU,Best video on YouTube!!!! It can't be free!
4773,qs2QcycggWU,how can over than 2300 satellites cant get crashed into each other in speed of 27k km per hour!
4774,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine 2300 tables equally spaced and placed anywhere across the land and sea.  Then vary their altitude by about 1km and they can just float in the air.
4775,qs2QcycggWU,"what u present a critical marvel piece of engineering....which turns our head....right now i am thinking the complexity of the satelite receiver module....must be more more complex than this....cause it is receiving and sending 100 or 1000 dishes data by a single (or 4 maybe) antenna each every second....btw want to know is it suitable in all weather condition like heavy rain disrupt tv signals...one more thing why elon musk build this...in today we are receiving speedy data (like me..in a village of third world country India,getting 750 mbps BB speed @ 20 USd\mnth) most of the populated area(not earth surface area %) rest of the people exclude this area neither big volume subscriber nor they dont need data (farmer etc) and if needed ground based tower or fibre cable can increase the radius..... my point is how this will be economical (basically ROI)  and how much mass  selling will  be that volume turns profit to mr mars..... he must have some other vision...plz make ur opinion"

Being involved with 5G ORAN and 5G core testing, the complexity of this system is mind blowing, to the point that it‚Äôs mind blowing that everything works in the first place.  And phased array beam forming is a small but critical piece of the pie in the gNode B (5G radios), and the gNode B is a small but important piece of the pie of an ORAN network (gNB + O-DU + O-CU elements), of which the ORAN network is a small but important piece of the pie to the 5G core, and the many elements that make up the 5G core (ie AMF + SMF + UPF + all the other network services like the NRF + AUSF + PCRF‚Ä¶.and on and on and on) are themselves small but important piece of the pie that makes up the entire 5G ecosystem‚Ä¶.

But I can't fail to take a pause and appreciate all the Great work you guys put together to make this Video, one of the key points I enjoyed about it was the intro, in play and outro music/tone/ epic sound that's being used has a backing track to the narrators voice, has a sound Engineer myself I love the compressor and reverb effects they applied to the narrators voice. And the way they explained the Analogy behind the technology is on point, with all the extra information and hints found in the Canadian subtitles. Is so Fantastic.

4912,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of animation is astonishing
4913,qs2QcycggWU,Had our Starlink head north during hurricane Ian.  And absolutely NO response from Starlink about replacing it.  They're are neck-and-neck  with DirecTV in the bad service olympics .

4915,qs2QcycggWU,Thank u so much for this explication
4916,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question,we use phase relationship of units to change the direction,but we also use phase in QAM,so how does it works together? If we use QAM how do we control the direction at the same time?üòÇ"

A: badly! ... far slower despite having THOUSANDS MORE satelites WAY closer to earth (compared to other providers*). That's an achievement.
Instead of hiring 3 professionals they went with a kindergarden full toddlers. That's starlink for you. Another cheap failure branded as 'success'
ps and IF you are a musk fan and think thats oppinion, well, I AM NOT the one who just lost a *900 million* boost due to lacking performance..."
4918,qs2QcycggWU,Was is too expensive to create a dish that receives and transmits data at the same time? Or it is not technically possible? Also i thought the satellites are geostatic so no need to follow them with the beam

4926,qs2QcycggWU,"Allright. I understood all this. However. How does the starlink satellite send different data to so many dishy-s? 
And secondly‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the health hazards being in range of constant satellite beam bombardment?"
4927,qs2QcycggWU,so satisfying
4928,qs2QcycggWU,Another INCREDIBLE VIDEO
4929,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question about phase shifting. It is explained that phase shifts are used for angling the beam, but phase shifting is also used as a symbol for data transmission. So what if the phase shift required for angling the beam and transmitting data is different? I think I'm missing something here. 
The reasonable explanation I could come up with is that the starlink satellite have a standard phase and it will compare the standard phase with the incoming electromagnetic phase"

4960,qs2QcycggWU,what we are?
4961,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink works like this.... First you use your company to get government contracts under false pretenses like.... Bringing reliable internet to rural areas.....  THEN you sell your soul to the Military and offer early access to ""customers"" in said rural areas.... take their preorder money.... use that to buy stocks.. and then not ship said ""dishies"" to the early rural customers but instead offer higher paying customers a cut in the line for roaming dishes in populated urban areas while also allowing said wealthier higher paying customers to move their ""roaming"" services into their country homes in areas where you deny the early access poor customers sending out emails saying... your area isfull and then tell the poor people who paid early tehy are being charged more on their prepayment.... use that to buy more stocks while never intending to deliver.... wait for inflation to increase and tehn offer them inferior ""emergency"" service with severly throttled service..{because you have a behind the closed door agrreement with hughsnet to transfer said poors over to their inferior satellites for a cut of the fee} and then encourage refunds.... after inflation has reduced the value of the preorder fees,,,,, PROFIT ATTAINED!!!"

4977,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm using Starlink to watch this video and respond (obviously).  But what I find mind blowing is how simple the setup is, as compared to the complicated technology.
The setup is so simple, I spent 10 minutes looking for further instructions, thinking ""It can't be this easy"".
Mind blowing.  But not cheap lol."
4978,qs2QcycggWU,this video is amazing  thank you so much
4979,qs2QcycggWU,Great job

If you're ok with speeds/ping/lag/drop outs that are somewhere between dial-up and copper wire internet speeds, then you're golden.
As of Q3 2022, I know far too many streamers worldwide who've tried their luck with S.L. and it's been farcical as to usability in real time.
To consume social media it's OK at best. To consume streaming media... not good, usually a stuttery, buffering mess. Gaming online? You better be playing chess and other turn based games.
For the moment, it needs work. [cue Gordon Ramsay: ITS FKN RAW! meme]

The AM radio stuff was complex, the FM Radio much more complex, FM Stereo way more complex, B&W TV WAY WAY more complex and color TV infinitely more complex. (That is why I chose digital electronics over analog... My brain can handle 1's and 0's) But all of that is Pre-K compared to this.

5142,qs2QcycggWU,"I don't know diddly about satellites. What I do know is when I used to speak with my cousin by phone in northern Florida, he used to have to walk 1000 feet out to the middle of a country road to get enough reception to carry on a phone conversation with me. Now he can sit in his living room and have that same talk with me, all thanks to Elon Musk."

5207,qs2QcycggWU,Good
5208,qs2QcycggWU,"I watched the video to learn how Starlink works but didn‚Äôt expect to also learn about how QAM works, which I stumbled upon many years ago (as used by digital cable TV transmissions) and didn‚Äôt quite understand back then."

5227,qs2QcycggWU,I don‚Äôt understand any of these but I‚Äôve watched the whole video.
5228,qs2QcycggWU,Good stuff..differentiating wavelengths amid an array of levels of amplitudes gets us binary code that is very easy to send and receive...imaging implementing changing the intensity of the many colors in the spectrum to transmit said data..just another level of detail that can bring even more information in pico seconds..or the speed of light....
5229,qs2QcycggWU,Well done
5230,qs2QcycggWU,You said the whole earth my friend. how about Antarctica?
5231,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing
5232,qs2QcycggWU,mindblowing..? dude our military had this technology by the 60s/70s lol

5239,qs2QcycggWU,well explained
5240,qs2QcycggWU,"omg i love this video! The animations are insanely well done. One thing that was shown wrong tho is that in reallity the sattelites are launched in the same direction as earth rotates. and the geostationary ones don't seem to move at all from earth. 
Thanks again for all the great content, I just found your channel today and instantly subbed!"

5259,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You for the deeper tech researched.
5260,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
5261,qs2QcycggWU,fantastic explanation. Very good animation.
5262,qs2QcycggWU,"please read this carefully and to the end ;

Every one of us has sinned against God. We‚Äôve lied, we‚Äôve stolen, we‚Äôve sinned sexually, and we‚Äôve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .

The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he sent his son, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . 
Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God‚Äôs judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . 

Do this, and you will be saved .

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn‚Äôt even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .

You‚Äôve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .

Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ; 

‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô

GOD BLESS ANYONE WHO READS THIS. IF YOU HATE ME I FORGIVE YOU AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOU"
5263,qs2QcycggWU,Bwahahaha. Satellites don‚Äôt exist
5264,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. Thank you so much for sharing it for free on YouTube.

5276,qs2QcycggWU,"Great Video. The lobe formation and beam forming are very math heavy topics. Kudos to you for making it simpler for wider audience. They can increase antenna size slightly and can add dedicated antennas for both uplink and downlink. That may help to lower latency. Also, lens-enhanced phase array antennas can be used to improve DOA-related issues and Rx/Tx power."

5301,qs2QcycggWU,Yes school does not teach you how to use soft soft
5302,qs2QcycggWU,you'll guys are awesome. Thankyou for creating such knowledgeable and so accurate animated videos.
5303,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much for simplifying complicated antenna and wave propagation theory into simple-to-understand and inspiring visuals. We electrical engineers owe you for this!
5304,qs2QcycggWU,I was able to change the time on my microwave. So yea...
5305,qs2QcycggWU,Grate video!
5306,qs2QcycggWU,Isn‚Äôt this the same as how satellite TV works? How is it extraordinary? Only difference is it sends‚Ä¶ nothing extraordinary. TV satellites can be setup to send data‚Ä¶ but it would serve no purpose so they designed it only to receive.
5307,qs2QcycggWU,great great great work done.
5308,qs2QcycggWU,I'd like to see the visual representation and changes compared to the 2nd gen dishy.
5309,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible distillation.
5310,qs2QcycggWU,I wish Im a 16 year old now at the AGE OF ELON  interesting and exciting.
5311,qs2QcycggWU,"As a electronic graduate, I understand almost everything, it difficult to explain this complexity but the animation, simplest explanation of everything of how it works, you guys made this engineering a piece of cake..Your team really deserves appreciation."
5312,qs2QcycggWU,How many know 3b1b ?
5313,qs2QcycggWU,This is excellent science!  Thansk.
5314,qs2QcycggWU,Amen Jerryrigeverything.
5315,qs2QcycggWU,lol.  I'm already watching at 2.5 speed :)
5316,qs2QcycggWU,cool
5317,qs2QcycggWU,It would also be nice to have a high level description of how the ground stations track all the multiple satellites in orbit.
5318,qs2QcycggWU,How does the receiver know exactly when the next 6 bit signal starts and stops in order to calculate the phase shift of the next symbol? If there is any noise in the signal determining the exact boundary would be difficult and thus you couldn't work out the exact phase offset with any certainty
5319,qs2QcycggWU,"Generally, the receiver has to derive a clock signal from phase/amplitude transitions in the received data.  So there is an initial synchronization period before valid data can be recovered.  Once synchronized data is being received, the receiver must choose the most likely point on the constellation each symbol belongs in, a probabilistic decision process done by analog means (ie: amplitude comparators)."

5345,qs2QcycggWU,"I just read T-Mobile users will be able to connect to Starlink next year. That's going to be awesome, I just came back form Sequoia National Forrest and there was no reception up there. Only in certain areas. It was like 95% gone, I look forward for the day you can go deep in the forest and still have coverage."
5346,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for your work
5347,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing

5356,qs2QcycggWU,üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5357,qs2QcycggWU,Oh my god you explained QAM in a few seconds far better than hours of lectures  I've seen.
5358,qs2QcycggWU,wow
5359,qs2QcycggWU,"Good video, why did it take Musk to do this, why wasnt this done by someone else? clearly the technology was already in use..."
5360,qs2QcycggWU,This helped me a lot in understanding the basic principles of antenna communication. Although I'm currently researching satellite communication. A video on satellite-to-satellite communication would be awesome on Starlink.
5361,qs2QcycggWU,"I do love cutting edge technology! I love it more when it is fresh enough for me to not have its physical real time workings up to 100% accurate in my head. Most of the time this means I wind up muddling through my own research process to find some personal understanding. But your video has done an excellent job of explaining it all, in short order; to both to myself and also to my wife (who loves to call herself 'Technically challenged')! 
Very Good job! 

The technology explanations you presented were easy enough to grasp that even too old timers like the wife and I could follow it through easily enough. But the professional quality of the video clip you used really made this educational wonder amazing, genuinely very good entertainment (if that's not a big plus, then nothing can be)! ""A pure joy to watch!"" says the wife."
5362,qs2QcycggWU,"amazing video, the information available is crazy"
5363,qs2QcycggWU,"That was so ducking good, Thank you."
5364,qs2QcycggWU,This was addictively educational! Thank you for sharing!
5365,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video, just missing the part where the satellite gets the internet from (spoiler alert, the satellite doesn‚Äôt have a router in space). 
You just won another subscriber, greetings from Dominican Republic."
5366,qs2QcycggWU,Im bored by so many grossly over simplified videos on YouTube that make people think they fully understand something that they now only know a tiny blurry slice of. Im genuinely impressed at the depth of detail and real scientific information and intuitive graphics. I learned a lot and yet I'm challenged with many parts that I can tell I don't understand fully. Thank you for this balance.
5367,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!  I appreciate it!
5368,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent rendition and explanation.
5369,qs2QcycggWU,"All that waste. Just lase it to a relatively stationary satellite. That way you can increase the frequency without sending stray UV rays into the atmosphere. 
Build for the future ray.  
Anyways. You gotta love the push.
A slap on the wrist, to a bankrupt business, to life in prison. What comes next?"
5370,qs2QcycggWU,Super explanation. Keep on creating videos like this. Thanks a lot. Highly appreciate the efforts
5371,qs2QcycggWU,Love this channel!
5372,qs2QcycggWU,yes please create more videos like this ine
5373,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding video on this.  Very good work!
5374,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! I learned a lot :)
5375,qs2QcycggWU,It looks almost like an alien technology... Could you get Samantha Carter from StarGate series as voiceover? :-D :)
5376,qs2QcycggWU,Commenting for YouTube algorithm
5377,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting but we'll outside my understanding, but thank you for the video"
5378,qs2QcycggWU,As a starlink user for nearly a year now this explanation is very interesting. Speeds and service has certainly improved greatly since the beta testing phase as more satellites have been launched.
5379,qs2QcycggWU,20ms that was in the very beginning now it‚Äôs more like 300ms or more!
5380,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic! And how well explained too!
5381,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are amazing üëè ‚ù§Ô∏è üíñ  thank you for this incredible well done explanation
5382,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video! mind blown to see all the science behind my effort of wasting time on netflix
5383,qs2QcycggWU,very good explanation.
5384,qs2QcycggWU,"I took electronics engineering and I am a cable tech with SCTE training and a backgound audio and crossover design . This description was perfect. I was actually expecting moving parts, but not like the motor suggested. I was thinking more along the lines of a Texas Instrument chip from a DLP TV.. Entertaining and well animated. Thanks."
5385,qs2QcycggWU,"This educational video requires of one an understanding of the most basic concepts, in this case, of wave physics, to fully appreciate the fundamentals that are at work in this complex system.
Thank you for creating videos like this. New subscriber here.
One thing though that I would have wanted included in the explanation is how the phased array antennas are quickly repositioned for the next satellite to track akin to the horizontal retrace signal of an analog TV scanning. Or, did I miss it?  üòÅ"
5386,qs2QcycggWU,"Beautiful clear presentation ! For the next edit you could add the word ""reciprocity"" to explain how the antenna receives aswell as transmits. I have a question: If the beam direction is controlled by relative of phase of signal fed to patch antennas, how come the changing phases of the QAM signal don't upset the beam steering ?"
5387,qs2QcycggWU,"Beamforming works on the higher frequency carrier signal, while the modulation constellation is done on the baseband signal."
5388,qs2QcycggWU,"I absolutely love your content. I‚Äôm going to subscribe to Brilliant on the back of this, as I know it will help my daughter in further opening her mind."

5392,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW!, Just plain WOW!
You all made this video moderately understandable! Kudos to those who put this together, But amazings kudos to the scientists and technicians who figured all this out!"
5393,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks so much for sharing this explanation, not that I begin to understand all of the complexities, I do get the general concept. Be someone who hungers to know how things work I appreciate the effort an time put in to make this presentation.
I am definitely a new subscriber!"

5395,qs2QcycggWU,"In laymen terms, You got a microwave antenna. 1280 antennas are used to collimate the beam. Then by phase shifting you can move the beam to the desired satellite as it moves in location. How far apart is the next satellite to pick up the signal?  Just curious how many lines of machine code where written for this to work properly. So you have to relay info from one satellite to the other or to the source of info on the ground. So it‚Äôs another military technology transferable to spacex. I think this is a copy of the iridium satellites that were supposed to do the same thing. Awesome graphics."
5396,qs2QcycggWU,Its a hit
5397,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is so underrated
5398,qs2QcycggWU,Muy bien explicado!

5400,qs2QcycggWU,I bet it is no different then dish network and direct tv !! A storm and single is lost !!
5401,qs2QcycggWU,did u watch the video?
5402,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, I'm a robotics engineer with a physics background. I absolutely loved the amount of detail this video went into. Very pleasant surprise. I work on systems that use LTE networks and had a good amount of background coming in and still learned so much.

If you're looking for ideas for future videos I'd love to see one on how blood testing machines work. After watching all the Theranos content I could find online I'm left curious as to how modern day blood testing machines work and the physics behind them."
5403,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a serious question






What would happen if you put your testicles on Dishy"
5404,qs2QcycggWU,I honestly feel like I need to pay after watching this - truly well made and highly thorough! Thank you!
5405,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this about Starlink many thanks for the team effort‚Äôs
5406,qs2QcycggWU,First video I've watched from you guys... earned a sub instantly. Extremely impressive video quality and information sharing all around. Thank you!
5407,qs2QcycggWU,The micro geometric's involved are alone amazing. Your explanations have my brain buzzing and I haven't even finished watching once yet. I am often frustrated by lack of technical detail in technical videos; NOT here. If there is something I don't understand I will Google or Duck it. So please keep making excellent videos like this. Some may think this technology is yet more evidence that Elon Musk is an Alien or from the future. If so I hope he is a friendly forceüôÇ Thanking all of you for this great video.
5408,qs2QcycggWU,"I hated electrical engineering in university and eventually left it after graduation, there were so many confusing concepts and the classes were not helpful . This video seems very clear, especially with all the animations shown. Gives a better idea what‚Äôs going on in things we can‚Äôt see. I wish I watched these long ago."

5461,qs2QcycggWU,Quality stuff
5462,qs2QcycggWU,Are Star Link satellites still sending broad ranged signal waves to reach multiple different Dishys? How can really a lot of different people be provided with signals all in the same very narrow frequency band? Are data streams only separated as usual by initial address codes ans such established features?
5463,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing work and visual Performance!! Thank you!!!!!
How can phase modulation be used for the signal if phase is required as well for directing at the satellite?"
5464,qs2QcycggWU,"the visuals are great, all the infos are  well explained + your voice makes me sleepy. a perfect video, thank you for this high quality content :P"

5473,qs2QcycggWU,This is what we need to be teaching in school
5474,qs2QcycggWU,"Do you love musk? Do you worship musk? Do you want to be musk? Do you need musk? Are you tired of libs? Do you demand a free Amuskica? $100,000 donations to musk receive free entry to musk-give. Grand prize is one jar muskcav, made with real rotten musk collected by musk personal pedicures. Additional prizes include one-whiff muskjars, a rare capture of muskgas. Great for ritual wicca muskings or personal use."
5475,qs2QcycggWU,Wowi
5476,qs2QcycggWU,"Had NO IDEA that Starlink even operated in the 14 gigahertz range. Most people have no concept of how difficult that is to manage ... stray capacitance alone makes PCB design a nightmare ... which Im sure modern software can help with, but then add to that issue 1200 antennas ... mind blown!"

5484,qs2QcycggWU,"Opposing electric fields may not cancel out with one hundred percent certainty. It may just deflect the waves outwards and minimize the frequency of said waves past a point of interaction. I think we should rethink the way we imagine these interactions as information that our minds have evolved to interpret in the most efficient way possible. Like an aerodynamic colliding at a vertex and becoming very small as a result, assuming the Universe acts in the same way from a macroscopic and microscopic viewpoint we can assume that with the age of the Universe that these fields have likely reached a point of maximum efficiency by now. Like the singularity inside of a blackhole."

5486,qs2QcycggWU,wow!
5487,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video. As an RF engineer who has designed satellite ground stations, this is by far the best video and training I have ever seen."
5488,qs2QcycggWU,"I disagree with the design of the satellite, so little coverage, and SO MUCH SPACE DEBRIS! at his can lead to LOADS of future problems. I like his goal. But, space missions will be made way more dangerous by these.

5506,qs2QcycggWU,hatts off to you guys for simplifying the complex technology
5507,qs2QcycggWU,Cool
5508,qs2QcycggWU,But is it dangerous to have that many satellites in the sky? What if skynet creates judgement day and the sattelies decide to crash into earth ????
5509,qs2QcycggWU,Today I understood the EMW concept here in this video very clearly rather than in my graduate. I belong to ECE ‚úåÔ∏è Peace out.
5510,qs2QcycggWU,Amazingly clever technology and great video! I wonder if this technology can effect insects  and birds ability to navigate? We know that they all use the earth's electromagnetic field for navigation. And we've seen bees and other flying insects negatively effected by a number of frequencies used in GSM technology. And sure Starlink uses very different frequencies - but I wonder what research was done on this important issue.

5536,qs2QcycggWU,Oh yeah your all amazed I‚Äôm on my starlink now and it‚Äôs pretty crappy service I tell you. Technology oooooo so good. F@&k no garbage all this future bs make our lives easier hell no I used to drive truck with no problems b4 2005 then technology started messing with it and just made my work harder and by 2020 it was just beyond ridiculous that I quit cause I can‚Äôt be a slave and make less money and hate the job I used to be passionate about driving is my life now all I do is drive around in my classic cars and trucks that never break down and give me no problems and burn way less fuel than a rocket burn that burns as much as 2-1/2 billion of my vehicles every second. Yeah technology is so much better. NOT. Wake up masses of brainwashed morons.
5537,qs2QcycggWU,"I have starlink, it's more consistent than my cable provider, a rocket o lying burns the fuel of 15 gas cars in their life time not billions, and it replaces infrastructure that would have created a lot more pollution if we didn't build it in space, keep your head in that hole."
5538,qs2QcycggWU,@@miguellopez3392 wow you are quite uniformed about rocket fuel it burn 2 million times more than a family car per second open your eyes while reading lies. Do sum research then argue. I‚Äôm not educating you do it yourself. You dam liberal hugger. Unreal

5543,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, Sir."
5544,qs2QcycggWU,Knowledge can not be destroyed it can only be transformed.
5545,qs2QcycggWU,"TLDR version:
We have given a billionaire halfwit free reign with no oversight, to litter the sky with thousands of very short lived temporary satellites in a desperate attempt to provide some reasonable coverage for a very expensive service by comparison to regular fixed line services, giving not a damn about potential Kessler syndrome from the folly of these rich idiots. Starlink has already has a few near misses, wont be long at this rate before some of Elons junk takes out something potentially more important."
5546,qs2QcycggWU,"TLDR, I don't know that starlink satellites have krypton ion thrusters that de orbit them and menouver to avoid Kessler syndrome, I also don't know that the service it's replacing for many is $200-1000 month internet that is 1/40 the speed and reliability because it's geo stationary satalite and the nerest cable provider won't build in your area unless you pay the $30,000 just to run a line let alone pay $2k a month for it."
5547,qs2QcycggWU,"@@miguellopez3392 Do you seriously think that I am not aware that they de-orbit after a time, only to be replaced with ever more junk in their wake to perform the same function. I could not give a flying fuck if they did a loop d'loop on the way down, that does not stop the fact that they are as much a menace as is Elon himself, nor does it alter the fact that they have already been involved in near misses in terms of collisions.

As for satellite broadband in general, that has been with us for 20+ years without Elon's Junk, I can buy that right now for ¬£20 to ¬£80 depending on what speed I want and have been able to for those decades and there is  the option of mobile broadband, signal permitting.

Here is a more professional debunking of the bullshit of Elon's and Startlink:
https://youtu.be/2vuMzGhc1cg

After which, once you've watched it, you will be left with a choice to either cling on to personal beliefs or accept reality and alter those beliefs accordingly.

But in brief, my opinion is the rich should be banned from space by Law. They did nothing to earn their money and should be allowed to burn millions of dollars they extracted from their piss poor workers just to give the rich a fucking joyride of no scientific benefit, so he can keep his flailing ventures afloat via mass subsidy and the stupidity of venture capitalists. Hopefully, his ventures can only go on so long before he will have his Theranos moment, given they all tend to lose money hand over fist while he lives off of the stupidity of others."

5584,qs2QcycggWU,Wow ! thanks a lot !
5585,qs2QcycggWU,I am watching this over Starlink.  Impressive and interesting information here!
5586,qs2QcycggWU,Crazy technologies oufff....could it be disturbing the planet ..
5587,qs2QcycggWU,THIS IS AMAZING. THANK YOU
5588,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome graphical illustration!
5589,qs2QcycggWU,"This has been one of the best explainer videos on Dishy I've watched, fantastic...  Thanks to all at Branch Education, keep up the great work!"
5590,qs2QcycggWU,so their feeding of wifi and spreads out like an big hotspot?
5591,qs2QcycggWU,"Watching this via Starlink makes my Dishy even more impressive. 

Really interesting video. Thank you!"
5592,qs2QcycggWU,It is astonishing how well you explain it!!!
5593,qs2QcycggWU,"This was way more fascinating that I thought, would be interesting to explain how the satellite broadcasts and receives signals from multiple dishy's simultaneously"
5594,qs2QcycggWU,Great
5595,qs2QcycggWU,Great vid
5596,qs2QcycggWU,üí™üèΩ
5597,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!!! One question though how the satellite determine the GPS location so accurately.as per my knowledge GPS has errors in pinpoint location.signal to be locked in GPS has to be extremely precise how do they achieve that?
5598,qs2QcycggWU,Musk is from another planet and his engineers are from where he is from. I have proof of that.

5613,qs2QcycggWU,12 gigahertz or 1.21 gigawatts? Why giga? Let's turn it up to 400 terahertz. You should be able to see a visible hue at that level of frequency.
5614,qs2QcycggWU,This is mindblowing. Thank you for providing this truly amazing content!

5620,qs2QcycggWU,"Your video is Discover,National Geographic level.Thank you for give such informative video."
5621,qs2QcycggWU,I love how you break down engineering in visuals it‚Äôs so educational
5622,qs2QcycggWU,Great!
5623,qs2QcycggWU,Man this is what TLC use to be.
5624,qs2QcycggWU,"I thought a satellite was just sitting in its fix orbit position towards certain area or country and serving data transmission (traveling with earth), and not traveling around the globe like a International Space Station do."
5625,qs2QcycggWU,"That is a Geo stationary satalite, it is 40 times further away than a low orbit satalite and therfore is slower at communicating information."
5626,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!  Always wondered how Starlink worked.
5627,qs2QcycggWU,"The distances above ground are basically correct, but how is it the producers of this video do not show that a satellite broadcasting TV signals is geostationary - ie. orbiting around the earth at a FIXED (""stationary"") point above the ground?  

If that fundamental function of how all (non-Starlink) broadcast TV satellites work is not understood, how can we trust that the rest of this video is even halfway correct?!"
5628,qs2QcycggWU,"This is BS, there is no SPACE out there, only WATER exists above, don't buy this BS, You can't fool me ."
5629,qs2QcycggWU,Then go swim in it.
5630,qs2QcycggWU,"Please more videos like this. This was incredible to watch and you guys make innovative technologies make so much sense minus the jargon. Amazing work, keep going this is an awesome video."
5631,qs2QcycggWU,"Not one mention of alien technology,  lol . I didn't  think I was going to understand how it worked,  but you did a great  job."
5632,qs2QcycggWU,Spoiler alert: it works as well as full self drive
5633,qs2QcycggWU,You explain things well. üòé

5637,qs2QcycggWU,Super
5638,qs2QcycggWU,"Spectacular review, now I can show others about this fantastic improvement to mankind & communications!"
5639,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant video there, BE! I have two 2 questions.
1. I wonder what would be the signal drift encountered (and how it's corrected on board) in that 2ms uplink and 2ms downlink delay between dishy and satellite. 
2. How does the satellite maintain its on board clock frequency to prevent relativistic errors, considering the communication is light speed."
5640,qs2QcycggWU,"1. Software seems to be a fix.

2. Satalites usally communicate with other satalites that have atomic clocks and reference them, kind of like block chain."
5641,qs2QcycggWU,"If they get Dishy at a low enough price, Dishy can have the whole world."
5642,qs2QcycggWU,I'm blown away at the speed that this technology operates.
5643,qs2QcycggWU,I am grateful for brilliant people who bring us these cutting edge technologies. Schools must never lose site of the importance of stem programs.
5644,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice
5645,qs2QcycggWU,I‚Äôm in awe of this channel. I‚Äôve never found anything that can explain such complex topics so deeply and clearly. If only school was this educational.

5661,qs2QcycggWU,This can‚Äôt be good for human bodies.  All those signals being blasted at earth constantly.  Think about it! Sounds like population control though cancer increase.
5662,qs2QcycggWU,"uhh...there's nothing mind blowing to be honest...it's just enhanced old technology. 
If they create a phone without the dish and receive signal directly from the satelites...then that's mind blowing
kind of dumb to boost Starlink as if it's very innovative and technologically advanced...."

5684,qs2QcycggWU,"Great work and so simple to understand.... thanks !

Would it be possible in next generation to send and receive at the same time ?  If so, will the whole setup (Dishy and Sat) will require change in HW or just a piece of SW update would do ??

How maintenance of Satellite would look like and what is the average Lifecycle of their operation ?

How do you control the Satellite SW if needed ?  remote connection ??  

how to make sure connection with terrestrial big Sats to transfer internet from and to Starlink is at best ?  if GPS fails to give the exact details or synch ?

So many things ...but that's good for now."

5799,qs2QcycggWU,"Idea for video: wifi is going in speed of light, so why is one of highest latency communication, compared to cable. :)"
5800,qs2QcycggWU,AWESOME!!! thank you.
5801,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content!! Well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5802,qs2QcycggWU,Love it
5803,qs2QcycggWU,"26:00 why did you skip the crispy detail of delay lines used to implement beam forming in phase antennas ? 

Also the first whide use was in French military planes, and they were te first radars able to ¬´ see ¬ª many ¬´ invisible ¬ª American planes   during Gulf war  ... They are used both as radar and communication device. They have the advantage to not move physically 1nd still point a chosen place. 1also, you can transmit a data to your friend a way that enemy can't even sens you are existing, or worst, send pure noise to enemy."
5804,qs2QcycggWU,thank you!
5805,qs2QcycggWU,Great intelligent and interesting content!
5806,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing üëç
5807,qs2QcycggWU,"This is an verry good video, but you nead to uppdate the animatons, becuse the the satellite receiver can tilt 45 degrees, and rotate 365¬∞ to track the satellites in REAL time. (live) 
I say that becuse in the video you make it seam like the satellite receiver are standing still, its yousing the rotaton and tilt to expand the field of communication wave area to always have the best possible contact with the satellite."
5808,qs2QcycggWU,I was an electrical engineer a long time ago. It‚Äôs great to see some of the fundamentals of transmission lines and signal processing in a clear visual manner. Great work.
5809,qs2QcycggWU,"crazy how everything is pretty much oscillations and phase. music creation work by swapping oscillation and phases shapes, speaker produce sounds the same way. noise cancelling in headphones same principal. light and color same principal."
5810,qs2QcycggWU,8:22 fringing fields
5811,qs2QcycggWU,Why can we get real video of all this? Why is all of this cgi?  I want to see a real picture of a satellite.
5812,qs2QcycggWU,The most understandable explaining of 64 QAM I've ever seen
5813,qs2QcycggWU,yes my mind is blown....
5814,qs2QcycggWU,How does it handle more than one user at a time?
5815,qs2QcycggWU,Totally mind blowing explanation and animations. Learnt a lot. Support from Bangladesh üáßüá©
5816,qs2QcycggWU,Wow - the graphics/animations are just amazing - excellent. This is the cutting edge of tech in 2022. I learned about QAM early 90's in Digital Switching for Telecoms.
5817,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
5818,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink satellite manage to searve 1000s of dishes on the ground with just 2 phased array antennas? How does it know to which dish it has to send the data?
5819,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, the video has surpassed the ugly video of Comment Sense Skeptic :))"
5820,qs2QcycggWU,Speed 1.5 is too slow to understand. It should be 1.75 or 2 already for the first go.
5821,qs2QcycggWU,amazing best explanation ever
5822,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work
5823,qs2QcycggWU,10000 satellites in low earth orbit sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Surely this this is a practical and economic barrier for this tech to.. take off..
5824,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent information‚Ä¶
5825,qs2QcycggWU,These types of videos deserves more views than pranks and nonsense.
5826,qs2QcycggWU,Mind Blowing !
5827,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
5828,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! Thank you!
5829,qs2QcycggWU,Good job!!!!
5830,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!!!
5831,qs2QcycggWU,"Bro, if you don't mind, can you do a small favour for me? It is, pls keep a video which is about ""how the digital touch screen smartwatches works?"" Ok?

5832,qs2QcycggWU,"Would be cool if this tech wasn‚Äôt just used to make some techno pig even richer than he already is. The tech is great, needs work like everything. Now make it free for all."
5833,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool part is that techno pig is using it to directly fun his other space projects so it doesn't sit in a bank account, hey can you work for mee for free, it's a lot of labor and I'm not paying for your Gas but can you?"
5834,qs2QcycggWU,Magnifiquement bien d√©taill√©.
5835,qs2QcycggWU,"Praise for the explanation and 3D Animation (Pls think of creating one video about same, showing about how you do it).
I can draw a parallel between sender/receiver set-up in Satcomm and Telecomm. Important level of detail that you have researched, explained and projected is fantastic. Your video can serve as start point for anyone who is looking to learn phased array antenna, beam steering, beam forming and 64 QAM. Visually amazing animations clearly show the EM and antenna concepts. Good luck to you for next video !! üòä"
5836,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink works the following way: 
1- Convince Starlink investors it's a good investment
2-Take the money, make a satellite with 20% of it.
3-Use the remaining 80% to send a Space X rocket, and put a satellite into space.
4-After some time, the fact that 1 isn't true will appear. File for bankruptcy.

You got yourself a nice transfer of capital from a company that has no future to another company that needs to show it has a market."
5837,qs2QcycggWU,"Months old numbers say they have 500k subscribers which bring in $600mil/year. Now martime and contracts. with Starship they can launch 300 satellites at once, so it's profitable with only a couple million subscribers."
5838,qs2QcycggWU,"@@timc7035 ""They can"" ? OK, you're a Musk fanboy. FYI, Starship doesn't work yet."
5839,qs2QcycggWU,@@piwi2005 lol so when it does what other poor excuse will you make of why starlink won't work? Especially now that the pentagon and US military have given high praise for the system ls preformance in the Ukraine? In its first year it already matched the user base of the other largest internet satellite provider in the world with significantly better average speeds and up time with just falcon starlink launches.
5840,qs2QcycggWU,"@@piwi2005 It will by 2023. Betting that Srtarship can't make it to LEO is a fools bet, but you can make that bet all you want."
5841,qs2QcycggWU,"@@timc7035This is an empty phrase. It's like saying that  if the hypertube can do 1000 mph in a vacuum tube, it can certainly do 100. You are taking as present facts things that just do not exist yet."
5842,qs2QcycggWU,@@piwi2005 I said it's likely it will be working by 2023 not that it presently works. Unless you think Starship will only happen by 2030 or never a year or two delay past 2023 still ends up with SpaceX easily filling out their constellation at very low cost. Betting that they won't make it to LEO therefore bankruptcy worked out terribly for F9.
5843,qs2QcycggWU,"Highly researched video!, it certainly shows the amount of time it took to make this documentary.And the video animation are on the next level. Loved every bit of this video"
5844,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful! I am a telecom engineer and I approve this video. Sound information!
5845,qs2QcycggWU,My brain hurts.
5846,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Video explaining a hard topic with lots of details very clearly and passionate about understanding.
5847,qs2QcycggWU,excellent explanation of so many hard to understand concepts in one minute. This video has the potential to be part of undergrad syllabus!!
5848,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible stuff, very well explained. I lost my mind every time I encounter electronic signals and communication"
5849,qs2QcycggWU,Mind boggling! üëÅÔ∏è Still can't belive how far we humans have come.
5850,qs2QcycggWU,I think even musk didn't know this much depth knowledge about this....  You are great... Not only for your knowledge also for best explanation with avatar-y animations
5851,qs2QcycggWU,Great video üëèüëèüëèüëç

5856,qs2QcycggWU,"I am happy to find such YouTube channel. 
I work on similar domain. Yet your video helped me a lot. Detailing is great too."
5857,qs2QcycggWU,amazing
5858,qs2QcycggWU,I can weld that
5859,qs2QcycggWU,Long time ago tv dishes moved by changing channels
5860,qs2QcycggWU,"Well-made presentation and animations, I have an EE degree and work on MRI scanners, this video made sense to me. What is impressive is how Starlink is employing phased array; magnificent work by the Starlink researchers, developers and chip makers. BRAVO!"
5861,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm mind bown with this video and the engineers of Starlink, I appreciate you all"
5862,qs2QcycggWU,make more videos like this one
5863,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is Blown to smithereens. now I Respect E.Musk More
5864,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
5865,qs2QcycggWU,They used Blender
5866,qs2QcycggWU,I love watching videos like this & testing my knowledge by pausing & attempting to answer some of your rhetorical questions. This was amazing to watch. This is why I love space because the technology & science employed is absolutely INSANE. I am in awe.
5867,qs2QcycggWU,WOW!!!
5868,qs2QcycggWU,I like the information I was laid out in this vide
5869,qs2QcycggWU,"Great, very thorough."
5870,qs2QcycggWU,"Can the Russian regime block reception?  Not likely, and that‚Äôs the good news."
5871,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for easy to understand video
5872,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video
5873,qs2QcycggWU,"Never seen a video request the viewer to zip thru it at various speeds!!


To me it‚Äôs like saying this movie has been adapted to your TV screen size‚Äîhow do they know what screen size I have?

Similarly, how do they know viewer‚Äôs cognitive absorptive capacity?

More could be said but that‚Äôs sufficient.

PS [Difficult to edit] The backstory is also fascinating: time to produce, original length, revisions, research, omissions, etc. Fascinating!"
5874,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!!
5875,qs2QcycggWU,yeaah... I'm first from Indonesian
5876,qs2QcycggWU,Really cool video.
5877,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible
5878,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video! Very informative
5879,qs2QcycggWU,üôèThank You.
5880,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm impressed by your work. 
But you must add the translation to Arabic"
5881,qs2QcycggWU,anyone knows why 120 wavelengths represents only 6 bits? the wavelengths are somehow duplicated to verify error checking or something like that?
5882,qs2QcycggWU,"brilliant explanation, I wish my engineering college teachers were able to teach technology this way"
5883,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm sitting here stunned by how well I learned how this technology worked. I don't just know, but I actually understand how the 64 QAM encoding works and in general, how digital information is encoded and like... what it looks like. I'm stunned. This is an incredible presentation."
5884,qs2QcycggWU,"This is all thanks to the behavior of light. So if our communication system gives life to your devices then what electromagnetic frequency encompasses your conscious? Probably the sun. Entanglement could be Entangled mind. You could really be in two places at once. As a wave in the corona of the sun and as a particle, which is partial, here on the earth."
5885,qs2QcycggWU,"Hold onto that! I don't know if you have a background in STEM but if not, this is a very strong indicator of your inclination towards it."
5886,qs2QcycggWU,Hi
5887,qs2QcycggWU,Holey Moon Rocks! What a busy Dishy!
5888,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much for the effort to make these videos!
5889,qs2QcycggWU,"Around 9:00
Quick question:
AFAIK A magnetic field is induced by the Current and not Potential. So you either have a current and a magnetic field or no magnetic field and a charge potential. Both forming together a wave with the energy transmitted oscillating between the magnetic field and the electric field if recorded at one point in space over time. It is basically the same as an RLC oscillator with the energy oscillating between the capacitor and the inductor but the capacitor and the inductor are so to speak ""in the air""."
5890,qs2QcycggWU,"The word is ""Data"" not ""dada""."
5891,qs2QcycggWU,"Good explanation of beam steering by phased array. Also interesting to see how the individual antenna elements work, I had some inkling of these technologies but now I know quite a bit more."
5892,qs2QcycggWU,Love how detailed the video is!
5893,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing
5894,qs2QcycggWU,- great video!
5895,qs2QcycggWU,I feel like I got a discount buying Dishy after watching this video! :)
5896,qs2QcycggWU,What an astonishingly good video
5897,qs2QcycggWU,Very explainative. Bravo !

5902,qs2QcycggWU,"As a Starlink user I really enjoyed this video's explanation of Starlink at a much deeper level than a typical consumer oriented video might do, but yet it still remains accessible to us non-engineering folks.  The only piece I was waiting for that wasn't included was how the satellite network connects to the internet backbone.  Presumably Starlink maintains strategically located terrestrial stations for this purpose."
5903,qs2QcycggWU,"StarLinks require a large number of ground stations to function.  The low orbit of the satellites gives each satellite a vary limited transmission range.  The ground stations, about 140 miles to any side of it. Signal quality toward the edges of that range will also suffer, due to the signal traveling through more atmosphere. 

They have some plans to correct for this by allowing the stalites to talk with each other via laser transmission,  but that doesn't seem to have made it past the test phase yet."
5904,qs2QcycggWU,"Perfectly demonstrated, Thanks so much for the effort you put in in order to educate us! Brilliant."
5905,qs2QcycggWU,Knowledge is running to and fro..:‚ù§Ô∏è
5906,qs2QcycggWU,Wow üò≤
5907,qs2QcycggWU,Love this video!
5908,qs2QcycggWU,holy crap...
5909,qs2QcycggWU,How does one starlink satellite beam form to many dishy mcflatfaces simultaneously?
5910,qs2QcycggWU,"AMAZING
LOC 2 the BONE"
5911,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! That is a great explanation! Love this content. 
Now I'm wondering, since Dishy is doing alone all the math and engineering of targeting the satellite, how is it possible for the satellite to do the same thing, multiplied by 100 or 1000, or whatever the number of Dishys it serves at a particular moment? Especially since the satellite is doing 90% of the emitting and Dishy only 10%. Is there a max number of Dishys a satellite can serve? 
It most definitely knows the coordinates of each of the Dishys in range. It probably has way more than 2500 mini dishes on board, and I guess at a given moment, 5% talk to Dishy1, 5% to Dishy2 and so on.
Glad there are smart people in this world doing this."
5912,qs2QcycggWU,You should cover the Starlink v2 satellites with laser links.
5913,qs2QcycggWU,"Gerek animasyon, gerek konu≈üma, gerek seslendirme, gerek tasarƒ±m; M√ºkemmel olmu≈ü"
5914,qs2QcycggWU,Insanely good... Mind blown.. loved the detailed explanation for a normal person
5915,qs2QcycggWU,"very nice that you cover phased array and then you say each starlink satellite has 4 antennae .... hmmm .... Musk probably want there to be million of starlink customers down there so ..... how will the satellites cope with that? How many satellites will musk have to send up in reality? Is there something they are not talking about?
When everything is launched will bandwith go down in the end cause of load?"
5916,qs2QcycggWU,I WILL RESURRECT KOBE BRYANT.

5930,qs2QcycggWU,"""we recommend watching it first at 1.25x speed and a second time at 1.5x speed""

So hang on, does this mean that if I normally watch videos at 1.5x speed anyway I should be watching this one at 1.75x speed the first time around, then 2x speed the second time around??"
5931,qs2QcycggWU,Verry impressive clear video !
5932,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for providing the world with eye opening and well described animated technologies. One can only imagine the future ! Thank you !

5944,qs2QcycggWU,Such a detailed video. Hats off to you for all the hard work
5945,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is the only reason I'm not leaving YouTube. The quality of the content is superb and visuals are unmatched.
5946,qs2QcycggWU,Hello from Starlink space
5947,qs2QcycggWU,wow. such a deep physics oriented video. I am engineering student but still can't comprehend how details this video. OMG.
5948,qs2QcycggWU,This channel might be the very best one to take off in the last few years
5949,qs2QcycggWU,excellent
5950,qs2QcycggWU,5G?  AAAAAAAAAA  [running around in panic]
5951,qs2QcycggWU,good endeavor but so many mistakes and wrong explanations... facepalm
5952,qs2QcycggWU,I love this information about how Starlink User Terminals work! Thank you so much for putting out.
5953,qs2QcycggWU,"I am not sure how you worked so dilegently for so long on one script.. but wow I am glad you did. What a pricese explanation. All universtiy students of EMC and Radio comunications need to watch this video several times. 
Were you doing a PHD thesis this would be 50% of your doctorate!"
5954,qs2QcycggWU,simply thankyou
5955,qs2QcycggWU,Kemey ke selam do
5956,qs2QcycggWU,"It doesn't... None of it exists as you think..

There are no satellites from star link. Balloons are used to keep ""satellites"" up for a small period of time..

Why do you think mobile towers have been popping up at alarming rates? 

This is all smoke and mirrors...

Question everything for yourself people and you will start your journey to waking up... 

One might wonder where the billions of dollars actually go..... I assure you it's not in star link BS satellites.

This is all fraudulent.. spend time doing your own research and you will soon find out..

This nonsense is designed for a couple reasons.. primarily to make you believe you are completely irrelevant and just a fluke... I won't get into the why. But look around and you can see.

God is much closer than you think........"
5957,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant!
5958,qs2QcycggWU,Perfection!
5959,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video... Thank you
5960,qs2QcycggWU,Your work is insanely cool! Keep going with it!
5961,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. I am blow away with the amount of technology that goes in this Starlink internet platform. Thank you so such a detailed video and understanding plus the animation was cherry on the cake. Thank you so much for the information and the content.
5962,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, so much research. Well done!"
5963,qs2QcycggWU,"Exactly  the same as the other satellite internet services, but because Elon is an idiot his system requires thousands of satellites which need replacing every few years whereas the other systems manage global coverage with just 3 satellites. StarLink will be another failure"
5964,qs2QcycggWU,"Video is mind-blowing. The quality of animation, the narrative, level of details. All are higher than A+. I rarely subscribe, but I did for more videos like this"
5965,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful. This video has enriched many concepts. Great work by the creator
5966,qs2QcycggWU,"13:08 looks more like 5000 x, not 1280 x"
5967,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome
5968,qs2QcycggWU,So cool and mind blowing!
5969,qs2QcycggWU,"I am do IT work for a living and this literally blew my mind.  This was very well done and for me, it could have been dumbed down a bit more.  You did an exceptional job on the visuals and explaning of details. Kudos to all who work on this. Color me very impressed."
5970,qs2QcycggWU,"Goddam I can‚Äôt express how much better this video explains things compared to boring lectures, I just don‚Äôt know much about the feasibility of this technology since I‚Äôm quite ignorant about this topic but.
How costly is this technology?
How many satellites does this need to work worldwide?
How do you avoid those satellites from crashing into each other?"
5971,qs2QcycggWU,"One of the greatest video I saw, I think it took ages to create such precise animationsüí™üèºüí™üèº"
5972,qs2QcycggWU,"How do they deal with red shift and blueshift due to high velocity movement, earth rotation, and gravitational well?"
5973,qs2QcycggWU,"I must say I never subscribe to many  channels but I just had to like and subscribe to your channel üòâ 
Please make many more videos."
5974,qs2QcycggWU,How have I not been recommended this channel sooner. Instant sub great work.
5975,qs2QcycggWU,wow so complicated
5976,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, that is an excellent explanation and the technology used is mind blowing. Few questions from my end -

Question 1: How do these EM waves does not interfere with other Dishy placed nearby each other? I mean how is my Dishy is recognized a separate entity from my neighbor's Dishy (which is placed literally 2 feet away from my Dishy) ? 

Question 2: Also, how does my data is safe from lets say hackers when it travels through space in the form of EM waves ?

Question 3: Will these orbiting satellites be able to handle millions (billions) of Dishy requests in future?

I love your channel and all other videos (especially SSD one) <3"
5977,qs2QcycggWU,Great work..
5978,qs2QcycggWU,"Watching on starlink rn! Getting crazy speeds out in a rural area. About 150mps. 

Got 20kbs over mobile data before in the same area."
5979,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Mind blown. Both dishy's technology and your video explaining it. Seriously. Just wow.
5980,qs2QcycggWU,"so what your saying is ""RF is black magic""...... ya i agree"
5981,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks.
5982,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.
5983,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done.
5984,qs2QcycggWU,I think what you do is awesome
5985,qs2QcycggWU,Phenomenal production and explanations!
5986,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome blew my mind hats off to the creators, scripters and simple explanation"
5987,qs2QcycggWU,My head hurts
5988,qs2QcycggWU,I just want to see a satellite in space why all this crap
5989,qs2QcycggWU,"It absolutely blows my mind I can watch this for free, thank you."
5990,qs2QcycggWU,"What a high quality content! You're making this whole world smarter and our future brighter! I am glad that kids these days can find something like this, thank you"
5991,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!
5992,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation!
5993,qs2QcycggWU,The old dish satellites don't move relative to the ground.  They are non-geosynchronous.  I am sure the author knows this but yet the animation shows the opposite.

6015,qs2QcycggWU,"The dish is said to get very hot and it's dangerous to approach it while it's in operation (radiation).  Also, the costs of the service make it a less attractive option for anyone with other, cheaper alternatives. Especially in Canada, which seems to be getting price-gouged by Starlink!"

6027,qs2QcycggWU,mindblown
6028,qs2QcycggWU,This was an excellent video that I happened to stumble across. This may be my newest favorite channel!
6029,qs2QcycggWU,"Tanks to my audiophile phase, this was sooo easy to understand :))"
6030,qs2QcycggWU,"Poetic, Theoretic explaination of Starlink internet technology. I liked the video even though I don't understand every part of it. Please make more videos about telecomm sector. LoraWan network maybe."
6031,qs2QcycggWU,This is a really great video. Well explained mindblowing sacience.
6032,qs2QcycggWU,"As a retired Navy engineer this was very informative and interesting. I worked on phased array 3D radar, so this was not entirely new. Although the technology is very advanced from my work in the 1980's, the basics are the same. This was done in such a professional manner with super graphics that one run through pretty much brought me up to speed. Super job, folks."
6033,qs2QcycggWU,"Ayy, SPY fam?"
6034,qs2QcycggWU,AN/SPS 48 mostly!
6035,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball I feel happy to classify that as ""SPY extended fam"". 80s, so that's NTU-era deployment of the 48 yeah?"
6036,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, that was my later years. I retired in '84. I started out on 55b tracking radar, but quickly saw that opting for a different school would be a good Idea. I went 48 while it was still young, about 1966, and then kept up with all the schools on the radar until my retirement. I was lucky to stay either a technician, or teacher, until the very end of my career when I made E8."
6037,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball So are we FC fam then, though? All my schools were in Dahlgren, and though that's mostly AEGIS central, iirc there were a couple of non-Aegis schools there. Feel like maybe something 48 adjacent was one of them. Something SSDS related maybe, idk."
6038,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball You're probably typing it but looking up the 55, that was definitely ET gear, so I'm guessing it's maybe less likely that you were reclassed to FC and more likely that your 48 tech billets were for ETs at the time, and then you went to teach?"
6039,qs2QcycggWU,"You're thinking of the SPS55, a short range surface search radar. I meant the 55B tracking radar associated with the Terrier missile system, which is maintained by missile FT's."
6040,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball Ah! Okay so you would be an FC, in current ratings. IIRC (and as you probably know) FT generally merged with FC, except I think some NECs would have become GMs iirc. Anyhow my very first NEC before branching out was 1143."
6041,qs2QcycggWU,"‚Äã@@mm8ball (Second reply:) If 1143 isn't easily meaningful for you -- I am literally you + one gen! 1143s own the illuminators (designation AN/SPG-62) plus their respective transmitters and FCS computers on Aegis ships.

Oh. Also at some point TPTB dumped ORTS into 1143 as well, bc on early BL Aegis, ORTS ran on a computer of the same kind as the ones that run FCS. (Specifically, UYK-44's.) For whatever reason they / we were not assigned the 44's that, at certain times as BLs evolved and stuff upgraded, were also present. 

Also also, 1143 techs going for ESWS early on may relate to this: Becoming unexpectedly helpful to VLS-type GM or STG friends, upon realizing their troublesome casualty or fault was on equipment they owned that was essentially identical to equipment we owned, but that they had relatively inferior training on. Not complaining that I didn't also own two more 44's as a brand new E-4, just pointing out an absurdity from that era, haha."
6042,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 I'm even older than that! I think I mentioned that I retired in 1984. I was in for almost exactly 20 years. In 1964 I went to my first school, the Mk119 computer. It used gears, resolvers, and many other unknowable doodads to compute lead angle for the launcher, and other parameters needed to track targets. I shipped over in order to get a different job, and was kind of forced into going to school for the tracking radar (the heart of the Terrier system.) By the time I had two years in I had all the schools in the Terrier FCS. Very unusual, but it worked for me."
6043,qs2QcycggWU,Navy RADAR. We needed a whole room of equipment to do the same thing.
6044,qs2QcycggWU,"So it works as i wuld have thought more or less. I meant phase shifting to direct beam, but to design and build PCB, amplifiers that works on 12GHZ, this is astonishing for me."
6045,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for this video!!
6046,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely well made video!
I just havent understood yet, how they are able to modify the bits sent by changing the phase while also using the phase change to move the beam in the desired direction.
How can the phase change be used for 2 different applications?"
6047,qs2QcycggWU,"Network engineer here, with a physics background. 

Refreshing to see an accurate, techy video that breaks down so much of the system. 

It's a rabbit hole of information but you managed to cover everything in enough detail to introduce it, while allowing the audience to choose whether they want to go further into the rabbit hole. 

Many of the techniques used by starlink are used in your home WiFi, or other systems you're familiar with. Starlink brings a lot of things together (including Elons infinite wallet) in a way that hasn't been done before."
6048,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!!  I appreciate it.  Yeah- I like to think of it as supplements to courses that could fit in any 11th / 12th-grade science curriculum, and really expose students to engineering."
6049,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation bro you are a genius please make a video on how to make my wife touch me
6050,qs2QcycggWU,Like kessler syndrome?
6051,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool
6052,qs2QcycggWU,i wonder if in the future this Starlink will be able to takeover all our telco services :D
6053,qs2QcycggWU,"‚Äã@@Chryeon - Technically yes, but in terms of cost and capacity, probably not.  And that's ok, there are plenty of lower cost terrestrial internet providers with even higher speeds and lower latency, but those who travel a lot especially in places with little to no internet service, Starlink is a great option."
6054,qs2QcycggWU,"That's correct. Beamforming/band steering has been used since 802.11ac WiFi around 10 years ago. Likewise, 64 QAM mentioned in the video was used in 802.11n WiFi around 15 years ago. Starlink is still very impressive technology when you consider the distances, throughput and a fast moving ""target"". Given that we are currently at 1024 QAM in ax routers (and will soon be a lot higher), it will be interesting to see if this makes its way to newer Starlink satellites to increase throughput further."
6055,qs2QcycggWU,üëç

6060,qs2QcycggWU,"Truly incredible technology. I am always a bit terrified each day of how much there is to know and understand out there, and know I‚Äôll never grasp it all. In any case, videos like yours make me feel a little better and smarter than before. Thank you."
6061,qs2QcycggWU,Perfection

6064,qs2QcycggWU,"God, I love technology."
6065,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question why wouldn't disturbances, obstructions and other local environmental factors like rain,fog not affect the transmissions?!"
6066,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow what a good video! Thank you!

Random note to everyone: TV satellites actually rotate with the earth (geosynchronous orbit, no need to hop satellites). The image shows them spinning around the earth but they actually stay in place relatively speaking around the equator."
6067,qs2QcycggWU,"How many eyes, arms √†√±d l√©gs do earthlings h√†v√©. I think the females also have a  orifice  that broadcasts gibberish to males so long √†s male w√≠ll  strand  for for it..She nas spell on him. Cal√ü sex. imprisonment until  he coop√©rates until"
6068,qs2QcycggWU,.
6069,qs2QcycggWU,"Will weather conditions affect the connection, like say, cloudy? And how strong are these waves, Can it pass through buildings? And can data be stolen somehow in between? I guess there should be encryption, nvm."
6070,qs2QcycggWU,This is such a detailed and informative video! Also love the fact that it doesn‚Äôt seem boring at any moment. But there‚Äôs one thing that I wonder: why don‚Äôt they transmit and accept data at the same time? Could they use different antennas with different frequency bands to transmit and accept data at the same time? Or is it just too costly?
6071,qs2QcycggWU,"Much appreciated.   Yes, it really comes down to cost."
6072,qs2QcycggWU,"yes, but more specifically, no. I believe starlink uses what's called PESA, which is one transmitter/receiver controlling every antenna on the array, and using the array the steer the beam. This is how it tracks the satellite so precisely. An AESA, which is found on modern military aircraft as a radar, has a separate transceiver for every single antenna, and can broadcast and receive many different frequencies at the same time, which as you can imagine is very complex. Starlink might be using something a little more sophisticated than PESA to let it broadcast a few frequencies at once, but I'm not sure. But what you're thinking of is AESA and it's very advanced and expensive"
6073,qs2QcycggWU,@@moonasha thanks for the additional info!
6074,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation Perhaps the two broadcasts would interfere with each other if they were to be used at the same time, polluting the medium and distorting the message content. Loved the video!"
6075,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video!!! But, how can one satellite support multiple dishies?"
6076,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely brilliant. Great work üëè üëè üëè
6077,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent description of some very cool technology.
6078,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Explanation...
6079,qs2QcycggWU,By far one of the best channels on YT!
6080,qs2QcycggWU,"You mentioned the patches are around 1400 in number but then in later discussion and animations the number is 1280, why is that?"
6081,qs2QcycggWU,"How does the network handle congestion and airtime.  Is it TDMA (Time  Division Multiple Access), CDMA (code division multiple access) or most likely FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple access)?"
6082,qs2QcycggWU,"Do starlink dishes use Forward Error Correction (FEC)?  If so, is it known what the coding scheme is?"
6083,qs2QcycggWU,No one has or uses starlink internet. This is a joke right? The satellite dish on your roof goe to a ground based tower. Haha ask a technician
6084,qs2QcycggWU,Great work.
6085,qs2QcycggWU,"Super invincible. Especially your dubbing like Star Trek, or the dubbing of the home game. Thank you very much for your work."
6086,qs2QcycggWU,Totally Impressed. No words. This is the way to convey the knowledge . Super simplified the complexity and yet interesting than watching a si-fi mmovies

6098,qs2QcycggWU,"amazinngg! cool research! ,3"
6099,qs2QcycggWU,This was a great video! As a computer engineer I was honestly curious how this technology works
6100,qs2QcycggWU,"Does the satellite need to distribute the 540 Mbits between all its users, and if not, how?"
6101,qs2QcycggWU,That was very interesting and I think very well explained with my intermediate knowledge of technology.
6102,qs2QcycggWU,"fantastic content, thanks!"
6103,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
6104,qs2QcycggWU,Isn't it kind of dangerous for all the people in airplanes if there are tons of microwave lasers zapping through them all the time? Honest question.
6105,qs2QcycggWU,"What happens when, during the shifting time in the 100 degrees aperture (for example from left to right), someone is sending data? Are they buffered in a memory on the dishy side? 
How long it takes to take on the incoming satellite from the previous one? How data beams are handled during that time?"
6106,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is a goldmine
6107,qs2QcycggWU,I would love to see what happens after the signal gets to the satellite!
6108,qs2QcycggWU,"Super Cool!  Would be interesting if you could have given a brief reference to how Starlink satellites ""talk"" with one another.  Once the satellite talking with Dishy is out of range, the conversation somehow gets passed to another satellite?  Finally, what is the physical size of Dishy?  Thanks for this video.  I might have pursued engineering had these kind of videos been available back when I was a kid."
6109,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually I understood some concepts from this video deeper than I did before!!!!
Absolutely mind blowing tech!"
6110,qs2QcycggWU,Great stuff!
6111,qs2QcycggWU,OK just give me explanation about that. For that beam change I use Phase Shift OK but for different data I use again Phase Shift so how Im able to transmitt data during that beam change becose first is affecting second. Thank you.
6112,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing
6113,qs2QcycggWU,The technology is very impressive! Thank you for making such a high quality educational video!
6114,qs2QcycggWU,Wow cool
6115,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't work though!
6116,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work? The satellites hang from balloons.
6117,qs2QcycggWU,No wonder Electrical Engineering is considered to be an alien tech knowledge;)
6118,qs2QcycggWU,By whom?
6119,qs2QcycggWU,"@@tgstudio85 many, who are aware of, that science of electricity and magnetism give them basis for marveling miracles in the field of engineering.

6181,qs2QcycggWU,I  love how something so complicated is called dishy mcflatface
6182,qs2QcycggWU,Also video like these let you know how far the human mind has come
6183,qs2QcycggWU,"This INCREDIBLY long video can be summarized in four words: large, airborne 5G network."
6184,qs2QcycggWU,I live in Montana I drove to the middle of nowhere which took me about 5 minutes. Went to see the meteor shower
6185,qs2QcycggWU,Great video I am new sub  please make a lot more  hire more people if you have to because it a lot of work but we need Content like this
6186,qs2QcycggWU,Overpriced and won't work under heavy load. Good if you're in a very remote part of the globe though but I prefer my low latency 5gbit down 1gbit up glass fiber that can do way more if I ever need it.
6187,qs2QcycggWU,"Great technology But VERY EXPENSIVE! NOT WORTH IT IN MY COUNTRY IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. First, it was worth DOP 7,080 (133.21USD) a month this does not account for the additional fees of buying the equipment which is + another (500.00 USD) plus shipping fees that's (60.00 USD). They don't understand that in these third-world countries people don't make that much to afford not just the monthly plan (D.R. $2,900 DOP) but the cost of buying the equipment and also paying another (100 USD) if you decide to move to another location in the same state, the country city, I believe that once Elon Musk and star link understand this and make it much more affordable they will succeed in being the number one worldwide internet provider around the world, I believe that an affordable well, not an affordable but for now a reasonable price tag and competitive would be 1# for the equipment anywhere from (150 USD to 200 USD) for third world countries and with options of different monthly price plans instead of just one that can range from (30 USD) to (60 USD) and not charge (100 USD)  Fee for changing location not at all if it's in the same city  now if you go out to the country side and you have a farm that you like to visit ones in a few it would be great that insted of paying an aditional fee for chanbgin location and yo only go there mayb ones every other week it would be great if starlink and elon musk allows you to inste of paying a fee everytime you like to swicth  location that they allow you a one time fee to buy locations that you might go offten, with that said I believe that starlink would be an amazing option and would be the next Big thing as a comunication provider! Best of Luck and in GOD SPEED hope this may come true sooner than later, cheers!"
6188,qs2QcycggWU,This the most detailed how it‚Äôs made I ever seen
6189,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Thank you SOOO much!!! Half an hour passed like 5 minutes, I swear!!! Greetings from Mendoza, Argentina!!!"
6190,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative just subscribed.  üëç
6191,qs2QcycggWU,You can actually see these starlinks at yosemite night time
6192,qs2QcycggWU,"Second comment here...again loved the video. A question I have thought of many times (and my apologies if already answered somewhere), is how a satellite (i.e., StarLink, HughesNet, etc, ) receive countless user transmissions at the same time? They would have to be sharing frequencies, correct? Like HughsNet, millions of subscribers on one large satellite...how do they keep the many subscriber's data packets from interfering with each other?  For that fact, how do cell towers do this too?  This would make a great video for you guys."
6193,qs2QcycggWU,"Muy interesante, complejo y a la vez simplificado video. Me encant√≥, desear√≠a poder entender m√°s esto. Gracias por su dedicaci√≥n y tiempo."
6194,qs2QcycggWU,Never thought something could be so interesting and boring at the same time I think my brain is melting down I'm going to have to take some shrooms and rewatch this to comprehend all of what's been said or at least tricking my brain to thinking it understands LOL.
6195,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this. I have a StarLink and am a fan. This video was fascinating.
6196,qs2QcycggWU,comment removed by branch eductaiojn way to go when i correct you guys you remove my comment real nice
6197,qs2QcycggWU,Seems like the dishy works in similar way as Active Phased Array Radar which is such a high technology. Hard to believe that those high technology is affordable and applied on civilian products right now. I just say wow.
6198,qs2QcycggWU,why don't they teach like this in school?
6199,qs2QcycggWU,ü§Ø
6200,qs2QcycggWU,"That's the best explanation for many topic I didn't understand well until I saw your video specially for Antennas, Constructing coherent of waves,  Digital Modulation. Thank you."
6201,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
6202,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive work
6203,qs2QcycggWU,Thank youuu
6204,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant. More please
6205,qs2QcycggWU,"Can you please do a video from the other end ? Explaining the satellite , 
Thanks"
6206,qs2QcycggWU,Way over my head. Understood just a bit
6207,qs2QcycggWU,Really It's a great work. Thumbs up guys
6208,qs2QcycggWU,Another concern I have as future  customerflat dish  out the opening sound wonderful for a mother bird to make a nest  on  right there on top of all Nick pretty flat face that doesn‚Äôt happen the snow the rain will cause dirt intoD  Bree in short  will there be a dome over this flat dish to protect it from birds weather rain animals sticks and such
6209,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Wish I had this 20 years ago when I was learning about this stuff.
6210,qs2QcycggWU,I really admire people who invent all this
6211,qs2QcycggWU,I am incredibly impressed with the way you broke down this information. It was far more informative than I thought it would be going into it.
6212,qs2QcycggWU,It's a 24/7 world-wide surveillance system paid for by the tax payer to the tune of 260 billion$ (the amount Elon made in the last 2 years).
6213,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are really good! Got yourselves a subscriber!
6214,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent info, brilliant presentation !"
6215,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, and fckk my Gov. leaders . i am talking about iraq"
6216,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible.
6217,qs2QcycggWU,Well done!
6218,qs2QcycggWU,impressive!!!
6219,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for making science accessible. This video is just absolutely, mind-bogglingly good. So very well explained."
6220,qs2QcycggWU,Woow! Excellent video
6221,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
6222,qs2QcycggWU,"ty m8s, well done"
6223,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting explanation of phased array antenna. Great job!
6224,qs2QcycggWU,thanks
6225,qs2QcycggWU,very well done!
6226,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! Animations are well done
6227,qs2QcycggWU,So cool..
6228,qs2QcycggWU,This is a fantastic explanation with an important level of detail that is left off so many other explanations. As an electrical engineer I could see this being useful in universities as an introduction to the topic to help give people a baseline understanding to build on. Great work üëç
6229,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for spending so much time on this topic! I watched a video where a student studying networking utilized wifi frequencies to make a rudimentary radar/lidar based on the same principle of phase shifting. This is super cool to see how it is used in commercial settings.
6230,qs2QcycggWU,"This is unbelievable, both the depth explanation and the tech itself. It's like learning some super advanced alien technology. I want to ask, how does one Starlink satellite communicate with multiple ground antennas?"
6231,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing! Lol
6232,qs2QcycggWU,Use of phase shifting for beam alignment is so smart.
6233,qs2QcycggWU,"Now that the wiring is complete the question is , who will control the global network ? We know that before the Christ returns a false messiah will partner with a religious leader to unify a global church and global currency. Government and religion under one leader . A body implant will monitor all economic activity and all human interactions.The leader will demand all to submit to his requirements or be deleted from the system.
If you submit to the govt. system of control, you will be cast into the lake of fire on judgement day."
6234,qs2QcycggWU,$100 per month and ¬£600 hardware cost. Not a chance it will ever be profitable.
6235,qs2QcycggWU,Do you not know how much typical satellite internet cost?
6236,qs2QcycggWU,"@@user-RCST Didn't they say $100 000? Add to that launch, engineering, marketing and administration costs  It cant work."
6237,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy mcflatface, elon musk is a master memesmith."
6238,qs2QcycggWU,What a good explanation of phased array beam forming! Great job! Good visualization!
6239,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, I watched it at 2.5x and got everything. Clear voice indeed."
6240,qs2QcycggWU,crazy!
6241,qs2QcycggWU,OMG ... Best explanation of the covered topics I have ever seen!
6242,qs2QcycggWU,"Now you can stream porn 24/7.
Thank you Elon for saving the planet."
6243,qs2QcycggWU,"Thaaannkkks man!
Love you!"
6244,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Excellent graphics. And Starlink is amazing stuff.
6245,qs2QcycggWU,Sopa interesting
6246,qs2QcycggWU,Yes!
6247,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredibly fascinating technology described in incredibly friendly way. Also many thanks for nice pronunciation, so this video could be used for practicing English for intermediate and mid advanced English students."
6248,qs2QcycggWU,Will this available on ships. And made for a marine environment.?
6249,qs2QcycggWU,Love it!
6250,qs2QcycggWU,I think the explanation of the coupling between Wire and Patch given at 8:00 is wrong. The electrons shouldn't fly away and the coupling ist simply due to electromagnetic Induktion.
6251,qs2QcycggWU,excellent  video
6252,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant video ‚ù§Ô∏è
6253,qs2QcycggWU,*Now we know why 5G would kill us!*

6274,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome stuff man
6275,qs2QcycggWU,This is gold... Thank you for bringing science and technology in such a beautiful and precise way.
6276,qs2QcycggWU,"That video is jam-packed with information, thanks. Now I'll need to watch it a bunch more times to absorb a bit more each time  In my career field (I'm now retired) I brushed momentarily into QAM in modem technologies. As for packet processing, voice latency, priority queueing, error correction, T1 channelization and more, I can apply it to your discussion while realizing much has changed since 1973. In future videos I'll also be looking for something similar on Neural Net processing. Thanks again and cheers to all you and the team's efforts."
6277,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video! The technology is a masterpiece of engineering. 
I have a question though How does satellite beam to several antennas at the same time?"
6278,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for all this knowledge‚ù§Ô∏è
6279,qs2QcycggWU,Great work keep doing...üíô
6280,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you... Thank you .. thank you so much.
I love the videos..."
6281,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, right down to the antenna theory.  James Maxwell applauds you :)    I'm an RF design engineer and have been working with phase array antenna systems for the last 3 decades. Now days I do a lot of the beam steering control code.  I'm passing your link on to some of my young coworkers, and others."
6282,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, great content!!"
6283,qs2QcycggWU,very naice
6284,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, this give me an even higher admiration for Elon and his great team of engineers.  

And gives me something to point to when I find in my recommended videos some idiots criticizing Elon with incredibly ignorant bullsh#t.  

There is this particular guy Thunderf00t who is always 'BUSTING"" Elon's achievements, with titles like ""Elon's neural link ""BUSTED"""", or ""Elon's tunnels 'REVEALED'... BUSTED""
 , yes he useS capital letter for that... and when you actually watch the vid, it is all speculations and more questions, never a ""busted"" thing... but if you read the comments in those videos you see tons of people agreeing with him on things they obviously do not understand. 
The thing is, I  have never known why they hate him so much."
6285,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
6286,qs2QcycggWU,The speed has slowed down too much to stream 5 HD movies anymore.
6287,qs2QcycggWU,This is incredible ‚ù§Ô∏è
6288,qs2QcycggWU,"Subscribed and liked, great videos and  great voice guy"
6289,qs2QcycggWU,Really great !
6290,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent work, thank you! Easily one of the best channels on YT."
6291,qs2QcycggWU,could you tell us the impact of having thousands of satellites in the lower orbit and the impact of the data transmission to our atmosphere in regards to; heat exchange and or disturbing the natural atmosphere? thanks
6292,qs2QcycggWU,"The videos quality is incredible, you deserve the world"
6293,qs2QcycggWU,I hope people always enjoy this kind of content.
6294,qs2QcycggWU,"Wanted  you 2 show us where EM wave radiation got its source? Is it only from battery or electricity? And show us in detail how datas r transfered? keep the good work, tx"

6297,qs2QcycggWU,"this video try to let me understand how it works,good good even i dont understand"
6298,qs2QcycggWU,fascinating
6299,qs2QcycggWU,yes
6300,qs2QcycggWU,"hey Jerry, would you like to scratch an antenna?"
6301,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible job!  Helps to understand how phased array radar works also.
6302,qs2QcycggWU,things like this is why i love engineering
6303,qs2QcycggWU,The phasing portion was awe inspiring. I love technology.
6304,qs2QcycggWU,"I've had StarLink since May of 2021 and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
We live so far back in the woods of western NC that we have to pipe in sunshine! No cable, no fiber, heck we barely have cell signal due to the mountains. But StarLink changed everything for us!! My wife is a teacher and she uses it for remote learning during Covid. And I get to enjoy youtube & HD movies from Netflix for the fist time :-)
Thank you StarLink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6305,qs2QcycggWU,Amazingly complex and mind boggling. But well explained
6306,qs2QcycggWU,"Could you please make video about Boinc distributed computing software, zooniverse, citizen scientist, Quantum moves, foldit, folding@home etc?"
6307,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive depth of this video. I'm truly amazed.
6308,qs2QcycggWU,If frequency phase is used to steer the beam. Why is it also used in signal sending. Wouldn't that affect the beam's direction? Thanks in advance for explanation. üòä
6309,qs2QcycggWU,"subscribed, liked, commented. now create more videos!"
6310,qs2QcycggWU,POS need to be removed
6311,qs2QcycggWU,No
6312,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink = spy = fandoghi
6313,qs2QcycggWU,It makes so much more sense when explained like this!
6314,qs2QcycggWU,Best explanation ever...  üëçüëç
6315,qs2QcycggWU,"So,  basically magic."
6316,qs2QcycggWU,I an writing a comment below

6319,qs2QcycggWU,Hexagon is the bestagon.
6320,qs2QcycggWU,"super educational
it can't be perfect but as a mention, there was a moment when the octagonal array was called hexagonal lol"
6321,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for explaining
6322,qs2QcycggWU,What a confusing story!
6323,qs2QcycggWU,"This is how all school subject should be presented, in the perfect world."
6324,qs2QcycggWU,Luv My Dishy!! Thanks

6328,qs2QcycggWU,That‚Äôs an amazing video‚Ä¶.I feel guilty watching stupid tik tok  videos
6329,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent
6330,qs2QcycggWU,I like this. Please make an Indonesian version of this channel
6331,qs2QcycggWU,My question is... How does the satalite manage all the data from all the dishes below them... And transfer them to another satellite after it passes the area with multiple dishes?
6332,qs2QcycggWU,How do the sattelite individually talk to thousands of starlinks? Does the sattelite have a Tbit connection or something?
6333,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant video - very informative and makes the topic interesting.
6334,qs2QcycggWU,"this video is crazy, subscribed"
6335,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent work
6336,qs2QcycggWU,"'watch at 1.25x speed the first time'
oops i was watching it at 2x speed the first time üòá
'a revolutionary engineer like elon musk' HAHAHA WHAT!? i thought this was a factual learning channel"
6337,qs2QcycggWU,Even if you don't like Elon you can't deny that he's an engineer
6338,qs2QcycggWU,Wow antennas are much  more complicated then i thought.
6339,qs2QcycggWU,the interruption on the connection because satelites move out of it's range can be quite annoying.
6340,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful!
6341,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is cool and stuff, but i am afraid we might lock ourselves on our plamet with thousands of satelites in low orbit. If a chain reaction occures leading to destruction of multiple satelites, we might be fucked"
6342,qs2QcycggWU,"Freedom from sanity and vision is amazing for the internet so, make it reachabke for all and safe"
6343,qs2QcycggWU,"I researched (=read everything I could get my hands on, there being no internet at home yet) about phased array radars way back in the 80s, when I was a kid diving into ""cool"" military stuff, like the Ticonderoga cruisers. Haven't touched it for a long time in my head, now it has come back and you have greatly added to it. Thanks a lot! Actually, I feel unreasonably motivated to get Starlink myself, just for the engineering fascination. Hope that goes away soon. :) Thanks again, you have a new subscriber."
6344,qs2QcycggWU,great  worküòçüòç
6345,qs2QcycggWU,You're right about 12 GHz RF being different to DC. Super high RF has a black magic component LOL. Great video BTW. Have a like and sub. Thanks you.
6346,qs2QcycggWU,"Does someone know how the Starlink satellites are communicating with the servers, e.g. the YouTube servers which contain the data to watch this video? Or isnt it any different than the communication between Dishy and the Starlink satellite?"
6347,qs2QcycggWU,It gets sent to the home dish then the satellite receives it beams it down to a ground station which is connected to all of the databases and then the same process in reverse.
6348,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! It blows my mind üòÅ
6349,qs2QcycggWU,"Very elaborate and interesting approach to explain all of this.
Thanks Branch Education"
6350,qs2QcycggWU,Easier and great explanation of complex topic. Thank You.
6351,qs2QcycggWU,Very detailed video. Especially I liked the explanation about beamforming and phase shifting. That was a great visual representation!
6352,qs2QcycggWU,This was unbelievably informative.  The animation combined with the clear and concise narration made this one of if not the best science/tech videos I've seen on YouTube.  Thank you!
6353,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing. Great video. I'm waiting for explanation how the starlink satellite looks like and how they communicate each other.
6354,qs2QcycggWU,"4 men slaughtered 3thousand yanks poisoned 10 thousand  in 30 mins  ira showed them how to set  bombs

6357,qs2QcycggWU,This deserves more than 300.000 Views! Really cool video!
6358,qs2QcycggWU,Hope your chanel can reach to 1M sub soon!!!
6359,qs2QcycggWU,"First things first -  This is more than a great video! I am amazed!  Everything you said and showed is how the ground antenna communicates with the satellite, but how does the satellite communicate with the multitude of antennas on the ground? Does this mean that everything explained for the antenna on the ground is multiplied many times for the operation of the satellite? Because a lot of users are connected to one satellite every moment, and that means that the satellite must have many more ""beams"" pointed at all antennas on ground?"
6360,qs2QcycggWU,Great explaination
6361,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating for a simple housewife like me..thank you.
6362,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn that's an amazingly comprehensive video, way to go!!!"
6363,qs2QcycggWU,"your content is above par .

6368,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
6369,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing? Here's a fun fact, satellites have been around for quite a while. Thanks for confirming we're evolving backwards"
6370,qs2QcycggWU,Speed and latency already outdated before it even became popular and affordable for the mass of people. Besides it pollutes the sky at night massively and produces extremely amount of carbondioxide. Governments and space agencies all around the world should stop this bullshit initiated by one pubescent billionaire.
6371,qs2QcycggWU,Sounds like you live in the city and not a place that actually needs starlink.  Get off your high horse.
6372,qs2QcycggWU,"@@user-RCST do you really believe Elon does this to help people? Why don‚Äôt he build up a way cheaper and way more co2 friendly LTE or 5G system? He goes 400km from ground to space, why can‚Äôt he go 400km from ground to ground. Do you really believe people there can afford satellite equipment for 400dollars plus 70 dollars per month for an internet with shitty latency and low reliability? 
Please, folks, finally stop believing public companies are planning to help anyone."
6373,qs2QcycggWU,@@michaelp.6511 SpaceX isn't a charity they have to make money.  LTE and 5G would be much more expensive to get into these parts of the world.  The latency is pretty good and below 100ms for some.
6374,qs2QcycggWU,Mind is blown
6375,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
6376,qs2QcycggWU,no one really knows how it works but its theorized it works something like a mesh router system
6377,qs2QcycggWU,"As a qualified electro-mechanical engineer, I just want to say - this is truly mind blowing.. I feel like I just smoked a 2ft joint in a string theory lecture.. I have been staring at the wall in wonderment for 15min"

I got 26 shooting stars maybe I'm wrong."
6388,qs2QcycggWU,What about doppler shift effect? is there system implemented in satellites/dishes to stay locked on transmitting frequency even though it's changing constantly through orbit of satellite and it's location above surface?

6421,qs2QcycggWU,the technology in it is crazy
6422,qs2QcycggWU,If you listen to it at 2X speed he just sounds like that guy that tries to give you the rest of the details at the end of a commercial. you know the disclaimer guy that talks really fast and tells you how screwed you are buying this piece of crap but it's so fast you don't quite catch it
6423,qs2QcycggWU,YT is getting bold with these double and triple ads. Like im interested in drag queen 2FA smh

6425,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic explanation and visuals - thx!!
6426,qs2QcycggWU,GREAT! Video. I love the hard work u put into making it. SUBBED!
6427,qs2QcycggWU,"It's so cool that some of the tech used by Dishy was from the early 80s when modems were still used for data communication.  As we multiplexing these signals, tech had to be created to for combining then breaking multiple signals back out again.  The phone company had been doing that for decades with analog signals.  Let us not forget, though, that the first electrical digital data was made popular by Samuel F.B. Morse in the early 1800s and within 100 years the Teletype Corporation was transmitting readable print electronically -- the beginnings of modern data communications!  Hat's off to the makers of this video for making new technology understandable to those of us who worked the grandparents of this tech when it was new."
6428,qs2QcycggWU,That was a superb tutorial and I learned a lot.  Thank you for making this effort and sharing it.  Greetings from Arizona.

6432,qs2QcycggWU,"Production quality: max. Price: free. 
If I can give a million likes, I will."
6433,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question regarding amplitude modulation. Doesn't varying the amplitude mean sending at a lower output power when the value is represented by a low amplitude, thereby decreasing the range of the signal at that precise moment? Or am I missing something"
6434,qs2QcycggWU,"Yup, the SNR decreases if the amplitude is lower, but if done very narrowly it won't have much effect."
6435,qs2QcycggWU,@@timc7035 Ok I see

6441,qs2QcycggWU,Brah.
6442,qs2QcycggWU,Super video !!
6443,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing animations! The phase shifting appears to work a lot like how VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) in aviation navigation, a technology that's been in use since the 1940s. This allows aircraft to follow a degree-accurate beam to or from any VOR station. 2 VOR stations can be tuned in to pick up an intersection between both stations."
6444,qs2QcycggWU,awsome

6465,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
6466,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! I'm a retired Nuke Engineer with a BS in Physics. This brought me back to the days of being an undergrad trying to comprehend antenna theory. My early career was in submarines where I got to see the phased array stuff in the real world with sonar and radar. Great video!
6467,qs2QcycggWU,Nice video.
6468,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best explanations of antenna theory I have seen in decades of being an EE.
6469,qs2QcycggWU,I've never seen a more simple yet comprehensive breakdown of SATCOM. This was amazing! Please do more!
6470,qs2QcycggWU,Who thinks of this? I‚Äôm surrounded by people that can‚Äôt ties their shoe laces . I‚Äôd rather feel stupid and be surrounded by people that think like this.
6471,qs2QcycggWU,Very good video but I'm pretty dissapointed that there was no mention of how the satelites communicate with/through eachother and only one short mention of them comunicating with the ground stations.
6472,qs2QcycggWU,"I just realized that l am very STUPID 
thanks"
6473,qs2QcycggWU,I'm amazed by the high quality and detail presented in an incredible series of animations here. Good work guys.

6476,qs2QcycggWU,It's beyond my comprehension...
6477,qs2QcycggWU,You got yourself a new subscriber due mostly to the last 5 mins of the video. Knowing it took 2 months to make and the cleicfications at the end whilst obvious things wernt to scale i like the fact you cleified the fact
6478,qs2QcycggWU,"I think YouTube recommended this because I was looking stuff up for Starlink, the video game. But I love technology videos too, great job! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
6479,qs2QcycggWU,informative but EM waves do not interfere with each other.
6480,qs2QcycggWU,I sometimes feel incredibly inadequate when I realize how smart other humans like me are! I wonder how much effort it goes into the creation of such ingenious products
6481,qs2QcycggWU,Nise effect
6482,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
6483,qs2QcycggWU,Thankyou for the effort put in for this video!  Very well explained!
6484,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome... engineering to next level...love it
6485,qs2QcycggWU,great video. one nitpick is that tv satellites are almost always geosynchronous and the video didnt show that
6486,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink wasn't for people who lived in big cities with fiber optic internet already available, but for rural areas where there is no FO or Copper (Coaxial) cable internet available nearby, since most satellite internet today are came from geostationary orbit satellite, it's too slow with 1000ms or more ping (you simply can't play online multiplayer game on satellite internet) or too expensive to install cable internet, starlink is the solution."
6487,qs2QcycggWU,"I'll give you a tip....
Anyone that says this..
"" with 1000ms or more ping""
is broadcasting to people that do know that they don't know what they are talking about

If you're  a gamer and you're going to talk about something AT LEAST KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

I hear this all the time from gamers, then i ask them ""and what exactly is ping ?""
and they usually don't know

so...
some tips
1. PING is the test ,  Not the speed .
saying ""I have 50 ping"" is an incorrect and illogical statement , it's on the same level as driving in a car at 50km per hour and saying ""I'm doing 50 Car""

2. it's also not measuring speed, but speed can be derived from it, 
it's actually measuring round trip time in (ms) milliseconds,  this is referred to in terms of LATENCY (or Delay)

it works like this (simply stated)
PING is not a test,    it's a program
Now, this program uses a sub protocol called  ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
so.. the ping program sends out an ICMP Echo request to the destination server

if the server gets that request it will ack (Acknowledge) it and ""Echo"" Resend the same request back to the destination server
THIS IS CALLED ""A Round Trip""

Now you also need to consider other things like 
TCP/IP vs UDP
so generally speaking when you use speedtest.net or ookla you are using TCP/ IP
Meaning....
When using TCP/IP  it incorporate Error correction , Meaning.. IT'S SLOWER Because it has things to calculate

UDP on the other hand is used in gaming (as one example) because 
WHEN YOUR'E PLAYING CSGO (for example) and you shoot some cunt in the head
well. it goes like this 
Your computer (because you shot him) sends a signal to the server (say  ROKSTAR) then it sends that signal of bullet data to the guy you shot

THERE IS NO NEED TO VERIFY IF THE DATA WAS RECEIVED CORRECTLY
because after you empty a clip of say 50 rounds
who gives two fucks if 1 of those bullets were not delivered correctly 
so.. UDP is faster and used in gaming
which is why it's not fair to run a ping test from google vs from your game

Now...  this is the part i call
GET A FUCKING LIFE
i see gamers debating the difference between 23ms Ping and 20ms ping
well... GET A FUCKING LIFE
You are literally debating the difference of 3 milliseconds
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO NOTICE ANY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR GAMEPLAY 

GENERAL RULE OF THUMB,   Anything under 50ms is fine and nothing to worry about 
if you're debating the difference between 40ms  vs 30 ms  you need to get a life
I've had gamers who had 12ms latency and they were trying to achive 8ms latency 
that's like having a lamborghini that can do 300km per hour and saying i need it to get to 300.2 km per hour
WHO GIVES A FUCK... Seriously !!!

so now we get to the end of this shit

HERE IS HOW YOU SAY IT CORRECTLY

You do not say 
"" it's too slow with 1000ms or more ping""

YOU DO SAY
""With a latency of 1000ms or more, it's too slow""
or
""With a latency of 1000ms or more on a ping test it's too slow""
or
""During a ping test you receive a latency of 1000ms or more and it's too slow""

You are measuring time
you are measuring latency
You are not measuring ping,    PING IS A PROGRAM that runs a communication test"

6512,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent!!!
6513,qs2QcycggWU,"This was very well done. Pretty accurate too. I'm familiar with most of the concepts from my days as an aviation nav technician. For example phased arrays were used for instrument landing systems. In those cases the modulation sent to the left and right sides of the array varied, one side 90hz, the other side 150 Hz. The plane found its position buy balancing the volumes of the two tones. I'm sure things have moved on considerably from then 30 years ago, a subject for another video?"
6514,qs2QcycggWU,Nope.  The ILS and VORs still work the same as they did 30 years ago.  GPS can't beat the precision that you get with narrowing radio beams as you get closer to the glideslope and localizer antennas.
6515,qs2QcycggWU,Sorry but ILS glideslope or localizer antennas are not phased array and never have been. They use polarization and a different frequency for either side of the runway. Phased array means steering the beam without physically moving the antenna. ILS ‚Äúbeams‚Äù don‚Äôt need to move at all.
6516,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
6517,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the best explanation of beam forming and phased arrays i've come across

6524,qs2QcycggWU,You must profoundly debilitated to accept that the night sky would be totally polluted with all these useless satellites
6525,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video, thanks for the time you put into it. Could you also explain how many dishies one satalite could connect. And does the Starlink satelite also directs its signal to dishies or is it more like a television satelite. Still, how would one dishies know what data was meant for it."
6526,qs2QcycggWU,this video has blown my mind
6527,qs2QcycggWU,"5:21 Did you use a Gilligan's Island radio on purpose, for this graphic?"
6528,qs2QcycggWU,That background noise is awful.
6529,qs2QcycggWU,"Absolutely blown away by the quality of this video. I covered a lot of this during an MElecEng but none of it was ever explained in such a concise  and detailed manner.
You managed to go from near-basics up through advanced antenna design in logical steps whilst still retaining core concepts and making it broadly understandable. Bravo!"
6530,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video! 

Question: In the notes you say that the other satellite internet providers use geostationary satellites, and then that the ground dishes they communicate with continuously move on motors in order to point at the satellite. I don't understand this part. If it's a geostationary satellite, wouldn't you just need to point it that one time at the satellite and just keep it pointed in the exact same direction all the time? The satellite should be staying fixed relative to you, shouldn't it? Or is not as accurate and thus you have to compensate for some small deviations (just guessing here, I have no real idea about it)...?"
6531,qs2QcycggWU,"I think you may be mixing ground stations for geostationary satellites with the low earth orbit ground stations used with Starlink.  This video discusses both at different times.  Geostationary ground stations do not need to move, but Starlink ground stations do move on motors.   See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isp0jfoj8nI where a lady ""tours"" a Starlink ground station.  There is a nice cutaway diagram of a ground station at 4:25 of her 7 minute video."
6532,qs2QcycggWU,"@@randyarmour6774 No, I was talking about his comments in the notes. As in English (Canadian). I wasn't mixing up the types of ground stations."

6546,qs2QcycggWU,Having that many separate antennas is it possible to create not one but few main lobes and track many satellites at once? Is it how military phased arrays radars track multiple targets?
6547,qs2QcycggWU,The Starlink Dish is similar to the BSB Satellite dish but the BSB Satellite does not have transmit capabilities.
6548,qs2QcycggWU,This video was awesome. Hooked within the first 14 seconds
6549,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video!
6550,qs2QcycggWU,This video was extraordinarily well researched and presented. Thank you very much for making this!
6551,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent. Another subject that is fascinating is the development of the Compact Disc, over 40 years ago. Philips has published the complete story of this and I bought a copy. Its practically as mind boggling as Dishy is and works on the principle of the wave length of light. Its a lot more clever than many give it credit for."
6552,qs2QcycggWU,"im more fascinated by the design of the array antenna than the satellite itself. although, its still fascinating that the satellite connected by laser light which timing is precise. i tried to build a wifi atenna long ago and still couldnt really understand the nature how intricate of the diameter of the length for the signal to actually works. even though there were some who gave the layout, i think i couldnt installed it exactly at the length to capture and or receive signal to boost signal."
6553,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this so much!
6554,qs2QcycggWU,cool thanks
6555,qs2QcycggWU,EFFECTIVE radiated power of the main beam and the side lobes would be nice to know as well as how far away some grounded aluminum screen would protect our hippocampus from brittle diabeties LOL?  ;-)
6556,qs2QcycggWU,I'm most amazed that this can be made cheaply.
6557,qs2QcycggWU,This is an incredible video! Thanks for explaining this so well with visual models!
6558,qs2QcycggWU,How do satellite transmitters not interfere with each other? Is there some sort of orthogonalization like what happens in radio waves in WiFi?
6559,qs2QcycggWU,How apm and phase of waves dose involve in both the angle of bim and the data in bit? Doesn't it interact with each other?
6560,qs2QcycggWU,"Years ago in electronic class, one of the most mind blowing lesson i can remember was when i learned about 64QAM, and while watching the video I was so amazed to see that they use it for Starlink. 
I had no clue about the steared Beam and the complexity of what i thought was a simple dish antenna and it really amazed me ! 
What i'm most impressed with, is that we get to watch such good quality content for free on the internet.
 Keep up the good work !"

6586,qs2QcycggWU,"Interesting though sometimes incorrect:

- https://youtu.be/qs2QcycggWU?t=170: 
The geostationary satellite is not moving relative to the earth

I still liked the explanation of beam forming antenna."
6587,qs2QcycggWU,Pretty awesome üëå üòé
6588,qs2QcycggWU,That is great presentation. I have a question in my mind that you explained very well how terminal communicate with satellite but how satellite communicate with the GROUND STATION?

6594,qs2QcycggWU,Congratulation branch education you  got subscribers from India
6595,qs2QcycggWU,Good research and simplified explanation with very good quality animations
6596,qs2QcycggWU,"This was very pleasing to watch!
You definetly delivered appealing high production value content!

Keep up the great work!"
6597,qs2QcycggWU,amazing work
6598,qs2QcycggWU,Very good one
6599,qs2QcycggWU,"Do the satellites have propulsion? How long do they stay in orbit? After separation from the launch vehicle, how do the satellites move into their array positions?"
6600,qs2QcycggWU,I doesn't work at all... as I'm still waiting on availability in my Area (central Missouri)
6601,qs2QcycggWU,"Wonderful video, thank you Branch Education"
6602,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for that giant effort in the research and animation üëåüèªüî•
6603,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explaination ! Brilliant !!
6604,qs2QcycggWU,thanks you ..so much one of the most informative videos I have seen at present...
6605,qs2QcycggWU,That is crazy-level complex... and very interesting.
6606,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video, thank you. If I would subscribe to brilliant I would use your link just to honor the awesomeness of the work put in this video."
6607,qs2QcycggWU,"Nothing new really... this is similar technology as Satellite TV mixed with a bit of cellular tower tech, nothing new really... Problem with this idea is the amount of Satellites you will need to make this viable,  10000 Satellites sound like an expensive public project to cover areas that very few people need internet access because the rest of us live in a city were internet service is faster than any Satellite internet out there... I bet Elon is going to ask for huge Government public loans and grants to make this possible. Assuming the size of the Satellite and based on what Nasa said about the price of sending one of these into low orbit, it will cost around 1 million $ dollars x 10 000 = 10 billion $ dollars just to send them into orbit. Do not forget that building these is very expensive and operating them is not cheap either.... All this to offer internet to areas were internet is not needed by a large amount of people...is wasteful.  100% this is going to cost people a lot more in taxes then they realize it."
6608,qs2QcycggWU,"Sorry this does not make any sense, the satellites sit in geostationary orbit, meaning they travel at the same speed as Earth's rotation and therefore remain positioned above the same point on the ground. The dish initially locks on to a satellite and once it is locked on it doesn't continuous follow a moving satellite, that just wouldn't make any sense as it would have to keep on switching to another satellite."
6609,qs2QcycggWU,"Martin  No, Starlink isn't in geostationary orbit.  He was referring to others which are."
6610,qs2QcycggWU,"What an informative video, you nailed it Teddy. I will watch it once again tomorrow. The video is so rich in information "
6611,qs2QcycggWU,Hlo lesics
6612,qs2QcycggWU,Good to know I'm not the only one who does that lol
6613,qs2QcycggWU,Branch Education and Lesics are my favorite YouTube channels.
6614,qs2QcycggWU,You usck at explaining.
6615,qs2QcycggWU,Incredibly fast internet. Really. They've managed to break the speed of light?  No. if its above 25mS it lags. End of.
6616,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, 20ms one way, 40ms round trip. Plus the distant of the server, you‚Äôve got at least 60-100ms of lag. That‚Äôs just unacceptable"
6617,qs2QcycggWU,"@@peterthegamer9334 From here in London GB my ping is usually somewhere between 13 to 17mS if it goes to 20mS  I stop playing as my characters are Solo /Hardcore  and the aim is not to get the character killed, Starlink is a non-starter for anyone that even thinks they are a gamer.   "
6618,qs2QcycggWU,@@IbnBahtuta I bet its incredible coverage can be good for anything else other than hardcore gaming though. Especially in remote areas.
6619,qs2QcycggWU,"im glad I already understood some of this stuff, its very informative regardless of expert skill level.
QAM PSK modulation is used on cable modems also. Phased arrays and beamforming used on 5G. The whole system is like 300 different cutting edge scientific/engineering technologies put together. But the RF microwave stuff is whats really black magic. The holy grail."
6620,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for your work
6621,qs2QcycggWU,Wow.. what an explanation and details with video
6622,qs2QcycggWU,"I liked, subbed, and heres my comment. Good channel üëç"
6623,qs2QcycggWU,"I am impressed with the animations and technical details, yet surprise with the lack of accuracy of showing TV satellites in a geosynchronous orbit."
6624,qs2QcycggWU,"@Branch Education 
I hope these gets read,...
But in the animation at 2:50 the TV satellite is not geostationary... but it should have the same angular velocity as the earth... But still great video the criticism is on a very high level"
6625,qs2QcycggWU,"Felix  Starlink isn't but other TV satellites are.  He was talking about both, but they orbit differently."
6626,qs2QcycggWU,@@SMHman666 Ofcurse there are diffreces... for example are the TV ones always above the same ground around the globe and all of them are around the equator. they are locked with the earths rotation !
6627,qs2QcycggWU,@@Flix_us His animation and his explanation could've been better.
6628,qs2QcycggWU,@@SMHman666 Well i guess it just wasn't that important and the video is always full of Information
6629,qs2QcycggWU,"While I was watching this video, my mind began to wander in reference to other applications to the technology.  We all know there is a lot of radiation in space.  Could this technology be used to collect the radiation electrons and channel and concentrate the electron flow it to provide propulsion electrons for a space craft?  This might solve a few problems, the collection process would lower, if not eliminate radiation in the direction of travel, depending upon the velocity of the craft and the concentrated exit of electrons would move the craft.  Another benefit of the system would be that the abundance of fuel would be virtually in exhaustible and would not be needed storage space on the vehicle.  I am about as smart as a mud fence in a monsoon rain, I am assuming that this has already been thought of by people much smarter than me.  While I have many more thoughts on this, I will stop inconveniencing electrons, which could be used for other purposes, and close.  Thank you for your time.  Have an excellent day."
6630,qs2QcycggWU,Highest quality content on YouTube. I love this channel.
6631,qs2QcycggWU,The work it might have took to get to the root of this is commendable! Bravo üëè
6632,qs2QcycggWU,"This is really cool and well-conveyed! I'm glad I found this channel, and I'm definitely subscribing for more :)"
6633,qs2QcycggWU,Why now 4K? because of the Render Times?
6634,qs2QcycggWU,Very well made and explaining of beam forming.
6635,qs2QcycggWU,This video is so underrated I love it!
6636,qs2QcycggWU,If I'm not wrong.. there's 12 shooting stars all-in-all.
6637,qs2QcycggWU,Magic?  Obvious downvote.
6638,qs2QcycggWU,"Complex and amazing, but what about the signal coming from the ISPs/ground stations? Does Starlink have many ground based stations to beam data to each of the satellites, or is there less ground stations with the satellites communicating between themselves and then beaming it to the dish? What I mean is, does the data chain go ground-satellite-dish, or ground-satellite-satellite-satellite-dish with potentially more or less satellites in between"
6639,qs2QcycggWU,"It's Ground->satellite->dish and vice versa. Laser link hasn't been enabled yet.  Each ground station has to be in view of a satellite or a satellite can't provide service. There are over 90 ground stations and the satellites have 900km range. Each station costs a couple million dollars in hardware, but the lifespan is much longer than the satellites. 10% of all internet traffic is netflix, so it's possible for them to install a CDN system on a satellite that would allow the satellite to communicate with the dish and seldom interact with the ground station for certain traffic and there are other CDNs they can add to the satellites, too."
6640,qs2QcycggWU,Who believes this nonsense? Anyone with a brain knows space is fake.
6641,qs2QcycggWU,"Once again, incredible video. You are one of the top creators on YouTube to me. Your research and visualizations are second to none. Thank you for what you do! Please never stop!!"
6642,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, excellent video."
6643,qs2QcycggWU,My only concern about Starlink and signing up with Mr. Musks smartphone service is Putin.  Musk has been pissing Putin off for awhile now and I could see Putin sending satellite busters up to knock down areas of Starlink.   Just a thought.
6644,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
6645,qs2QcycggWU,You definitely got my sub for the awesome video. Great Work!!
6646,qs2QcycggWU,"Interesting facts, but to much verbal Diarrhea, for me would have been better split into smaller video chunks."
6647,qs2QcycggWU,kjm 1955  Not at all.  Maybe watch it again to clarify things you didn't understand first time.
6648,qs2QcycggWU,Can‚Äôt get any better
6649,qs2QcycggWU,"How does the satellite receive and send from many ""Dishies"" at the same time? How would it distinguish multiple dishes? Does it use something similar to WiFi/ethernet algorithms (like, try sending, if many send at the same time, stop and try again after random delay?) and if so, would one single malicious ""Dishy"" take the whole thing down by continuously sending to a satellite?"
6650,qs2QcycggWU,"I would imagine it would use M.A.C. (Media Access Control) Addresses to do that.
this would also explain how, if in the future he wishes to add more dishes to the network, how he would do that 
Basic Layer 2 networking and you just go from there

as for the communication, it's 2 way , but not simultaneous
so... Not Full Duplex,   but Half Duplex Transmission"
6651,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this amazing video.
6652,qs2QcycggWU,"To all of my techy friends, I'm going to show this to them

6653,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for the time spent in generating this video. I think I have come to understand 70% of the physical phenomena detailed in the video, but this means that I am infinitely closer than I knew before watching the video."
6654,qs2QcycggWU,one of the most instructive videos on youtube i have ever seen... very nice work
6655,qs2QcycggWU,ü§Ø all I need now is an NZT pill to apply this new found knowledge lol
6656,qs2QcycggWU,"I think the bigger question is, who did the Transcripts for this? Canadian English transcript is whacked. I would initially say it is more scientific, but even your numbers are off, 1400 antenna vs 1280. The differences in the two transcripts are borderline offensive. You obviously have not checked them."

6684,qs2QcycggWU,"It's insane how brilliant minds super smart theoretical physicists, come up with the science to verify and put stuff like this into production. It all starts with a theory."
6685,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best explanation of how radio signals and data transmission works. This could literally replace weeks of classes and yield much better results.
6686,qs2QcycggWU,Beam Forming well explained without Maxwell Equations!
6687,qs2QcycggWU,Well done! That was a great explanation.
6688,qs2QcycggWU,"That graphic at 2 minutes 30ish is totally wrong, the tv satellite should be moving in the same directon as the earth at the SAME SPEED, thats the whole point, They are geostationary. also I think starlink satellites move in the same direction as the earth too"
6689,qs2QcycggWU,Marvelous video of a great eng design!!

6691,qs2QcycggWU,this is interestingly amazing
6692,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, great presentation, loved it"
6693,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes my mind was blown.  But if the satellite is talking to one dish, and there are a mere 10,000 satellites in orbit.  Only one satellite can be over a single geographical point of the earth where they could be many dishes within the 100¬∞ arch of the dish. How does it communicate with many dishes at one time.  I know that the speed of exchange is fast. So it the satellite only transmitting and receiving from one ground dish at a time?"
6694,qs2QcycggWU,Really interesting content. Well done! Can you make a video about the ground-station satellite broadcast? And one on multi-dish satellite communication?
6695,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for sharing...
6696,qs2QcycggWU,Is starlink satellite internet susceptible to black out due to weather such as thunder storms as direct TV satellite is?

6709,qs2QcycggWU,Phased array antenna was first used in the 1980s MIG fighter jets to track multiple targets.
6710,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm curious.. does the phase modulation of a signal not obstruct the performance of the phased array? 

It seems like it would be much harder to steer a beam into a certain direction when the phase already needs to have a specific value because of the modulation."

 A bit more connectivity in a world that already has coverage pretty much everywhere is certainly not worth losing the ability to enjoy natural beauty anywhere at night anymore, but now those horribly bright and obnoxious satellites make their unwelcome appearance no matter where you go and the sky is ruined perhaps forever. Whoever decided this was OK is absolutely Evil."

I'm near Newport, Oregon, and trying to find a specific spot without trees would be easier if I could narrow down ""The northern half of the sky"" to ""A specific 90 degree cone"". 
Still, this is a GAME CHANGER for rural internet. DSL operating at 1-3MB/s, Cable at 100, and no Fiber at all. Starlink? 120mbps."
6743,qs2QcycggWU,I love it
6744,qs2QcycggWU,Content of this video is above and beyond discovery channel. Starling is mind blowing. The only thing annoys me is how little I know and how fast I'm staying behind the world through my life. I'm 30 and still helping my dad with his new smartphone or pc issues.

6750,qs2QcycggWU,But if the bandwith can be 540 MB then why starlink offers only 150?
6751,qs2QcycggWU,"Hello, first time on this channel,
I checked also your pinned channels and I do have a question.
im 100% sure I know your voice but its 1st time ever where im on any of channels here.
so did you ever had other YT channels? or maybe you were in some science TV show?"
6752,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video. Thanks for the super detailed explanation. I am star struck by how awesome human technology is but at the same time, we have murder hobos. LOL"

With my experience in electronic, my military experience, and being a HAM RADIO operator experience most of this Video was very clear to understanding, but some was over my head.  When starlink first came on line I did not understand its concept, but this video cleared up much of how starlink worked. Great work in explaining this video how starlink operates‚Ä¶.."
6760,qs2QcycggWU,"Really awesome video. Wanted to know about the the data encoding, would the amplitude be reliable all the time, when using amplitude and phase shift? What if the medium change and the amplitude changes a little."
6761,qs2QcycggWU,"Well yes, the US was pretty good of making a junkyard of herself so why stop there. There a whole lot of space right on top of the world we could do the same. F#ck all the scientists and cosmologists with their telescopes trying to do fundamental science, One cannot have enough spacejunk."
6762,qs2QcycggWU,"there is no space junk. there is plenty of lies to this story. just keeping this space junk in LE orbit would be massively costly for even trying to do that. all of elon musks endeavours mostly exist only on the internet and media. because if it was tried to do in reality, there would be no money to fund it. immense amounts of energy spent, for little temporary effect before it all comes back to equilibrium."

6770,qs2QcycggWU,This is one of the best videos on YT right now. Amazing. Thank You so much.
6771,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting, I watched this at 1.5 speed and understood it all I think. It is feasible to have NEARLY 1.5Gbs at 2 TO 5ms latency if you used two Dishys with one in receive mode ONLY and one in NORMAL MODE if I am understanding this correctly. The reason for possible increased latency is since each dishy has about a 100 degree field of view, you could potentially have the two dishys pointed in different directions about 720 meters apart, using cat6 or better to a central location and have a much wider coverage, especially if at the peak of a mountain with one dishy not physically being able to ""see"" the other. This would provide, while both are operating, much faster speeds in both uplink and downlink, and if one goes down, while link speeds will slow, it will not die entirely.
A few questions:
1. How many sats are currently in orbit and what is the number per year on the planning board to put the required amount in orbit for continuous coverage with a few hundred extra thrown in for redundancy?
2.  Will the cost come down as more sats go up?
3. What is the reason for NOT using geostationary sats? Seems that if the sats were geostationary, then the beam steering would not really be needed and used only to fine tune the signal strength!
Thank you for an outstanding video. For me it was informative and makes me want to learn more!"
6772,qs2QcycggWU,seriously multideciplinary
6773,qs2QcycggWU,I am a phased array product manager  for the satellite industry (25 years).  This is an amazing explanation and perfect for engineers to understand how this technology works
6774,qs2QcycggWU,Do you have a transcript of the Canadian subtitles?
6775,qs2QcycggWU,@@gerencher isn't canadian english?
6776,qs2QcycggWU,"since you are, phased array product manager for the satellite industry, for 25 years, how much do you think this is real, and profitable? it seems, way too much effort for very little benefit. 
firstly 99% people of the earth already have internet that is faster better and stronger then starlink. 
so how does elon come up with the magical funds to fund this, loss making venture? it requires 1000's of sattelites to operate. not even 5% of sattelites are engaged as a given time. most of them floating over oceans and deserts. the sattelites will need to be replenished for power and propelant. this means it will need to replace the sattelites every few years. knowing LE orbit means probably even faster.
is this a scam of some sorts? and for what? to spread panic and fear? thats the daily bread of people now a days.
so can you tell?"
6777,qs2QcycggWU,"The Starlink ""Dishy McFlatface"" (cute name) sends out the radio wave to a big wide direction. 
The power is sent wide. 
Happens to be, if you time it right (slight offset each), they add in one angle of their beam."
6778,qs2QcycggWU,"How long before this technology will be available on smart phone? I've seen the ""Tesla Model Pi"" Be leaked or teased, but am hoping we arent too far from getting that in our hand. Verizon Service is trash. Never have service lol"

Its one thing to know about it and how it works in your head but to see it so perfectly animated was satisfying AF like a massage for my brain. would be super awesome to see and understand the math. Around 24mins seems to be missing quite allot but PSK/phase shift keying is a video on its own. You need a reference and a lock because as it stands as explained in the video qam 64 would be defeated by atmospheric aberrations while attempting beam forming. What a serious bit of kit. its brought up too in creators comments. curiousmarc and his Apollo comms series explains PSK. its a really wild concept and takes a while to grasp. Took a few resources for me and I could still use a refresher."

6849,qs2QcycggWU,"One question: AFAIK, clocks between any two electronic devices aren't easily synchronized; and I imagine they might be too slow to catch these pico-second period of carrier signal anyways.
So how are the antennae detecting the phase shift accurately? If it mis-calculated the phase shift one symbol, then does it affect the next symbol too?"

6856,qs2QcycggWU,Pretty good but there are a few mistakes.
6857,qs2QcycggWU,Traditional dish antennas point to geosynchronous satellites. Your animation should show the satellite in sync with the Earth's rotation so that from the ground it appears to not move its position relative to the ground.

6889,qs2QcycggWU,"that is why it is soo expensive,"
6890,qs2QcycggWU,"Realy? no tv satellite has internet possibility?
....
No way for smaller dish for lets say a moving car?
...
Wouldn't higher altitude allow for less satelites at expense of ping which honestly for use of satelite internet is actually pointless?
...
Does ammount of antenna differ from regular satelite internet dish if so why?
...
You explain greatly how regular radio works but is it any different from how walkie-talkie antenna works - how is this new?
....
Pico second sounds amazing... Oh wait 10^-12 thats basicly saying gigahertz but how many hertz there was...sounds amazing till you realize you can buy such antenna for decades and build long before
...
Amplification is nice but is it new? Anything to do with parabolic shape of the thing?
Does realy hexagonal matter? What would happen if i used any other pattern to fill a plane?
...
No 1280 is actually 1 antenna same as we although used every single radio telescope to get picture of a black hole it for sake of a ""lense"" was 1 telescope
...
Phased array is neat way of saying if satellite isn't where you aim you have no connection...dont believe me... Move that thing to face 30 degrees any other direction.... Oh look no more connection that is also a reason why 10k satelites are needed for full cover
....
And software requires something not mentioned... accurate clock...accurate to that picosecond long-term wise...that requires battery... Cr2032 replacers will know what that means...since you cant disassemble
....
6 bits ... Pst he is talking about packets 
....
Damn do you like switching hz to seconds ...  Well i dont mind 
Let me try i like seconds per joul why not talk in these terms?
...
You are doing a video representation ... Yes you can show a pixel let me introduce tou to scaling used on maps since 2 dudes in france and their offspring
 1:500000 should show anything you want to show"
6891,qs2QcycggWU,I might sound salty... But i stand by what i wrote
6892,qs2QcycggWU,This beamforming and beam steering is also the fundamental working principles in 5G.
6893,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, McFlatface is SO much more complicated than I could have ever imagined ....totally mind boggling would be an understatement !!"

I would point out that in addition to receive only satellite TV antennas that communicate with geostationary satellites, there are also two way antennas that communicate to GSO satellites as well, along with other variants which provided two way communications with other non-geostationary satellite networks in different orbits."

6939,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation  Wow!  What a candid, honest answer.  The world needs more educators like you."
6940,qs2QcycggWU,"RideGasGas, thanks for your comment.  Glad to know there are few old guys still interested in this stuff.  I first worked on analog computers in nuclear bombers 55 years ago.  It wasn't until 37 years ago, though, that I got the chance to work in computer data communications for a large telecom.  As a sys tech in a major data center, I was disappointed that their tech was so old school in the late '80s.  All the computer data connections were via RS-232c (25 pair) cable.  It wasn't until the very late '80s and early '90s that they began using TCP/IP and RJ-45 in house.  Even then, it took them many years to replace everything.  By then, I had retired.  You'd laugh at the punch cards and paper tape we used  on some minicomputers to load data.  LOL!   All that was from a center where we monitored datacom from several mainframes, 2,000 minicomputers, and around 30,000 servers on a WAN that covered 9 U.S. states."
6941,qs2QcycggWU,"Would you mind taking a look at this? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwfO_bOeQU"
6942,qs2QcycggWU,@@ron.v this is always the case businesses grow organically and witgout a plan of the whole garden soon becomes a wild mess. Unfortunatly putting a rotorvator tgrough it all and replacing it is rarely an option. The cost of maintaining a legacy system while running up a new replacement (modern technology) system is unfortunatly something few financial directors are willing to pay. Even when it is by far the best option. So 95% of your time is spent fire fighting existing issues and 5% trying to work up a replacement peicemeal. The compromises that have to be made then usually cripple the updated parts of the system and bring few improvments for many years. Which then get picked on by director level people who have no understanding of modern systems (thay frequently having set up the old ones and usually do not want to see their work retired by something they then do not understand) lol. Oh the joys of IT polatics.
6943,qs2QcycggWU,"@@williamarmstrong7199  Very well explained.  I watched the same things happen in the steel industry where my father, uncles, and brother worked.  The leaders milk the old tech for all it's worth then do exactly as you said.  It has nothing to do with whether the new tech is better and everything to do with whether investors get an immediate return on investment.  Start ups almost always do better because they have no out-of-date investment to deal with. 

What amazes me is how existing companies can misjudge new tech when they could have profited from it big time.  Examples are how the founder of Digital Eqpt. said,  ‚ÄúThere is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home"" and how Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center literally gave away the GUI and mouse, etc. because their corporate leaders didn't recognize their value."
6944,qs2QcycggWU,Are there any safety concerns mounting dishy above a living space?
6945,qs2QcycggWU,"@@scottferguson527 SpaceX filed a radio frequency exposure analysis as part of their application to the FCC far a blanket license to operate Dishy and the newer rectangular version.  Both antennas are well below both the FCC and international limits for exposure. 

Keep in mind that the antennas radiate power up in a narrow beam, so there is very little power behind the antenna or off to the sides.  Also, at these frequencies there is very high attenuation of the radio frequency energy by the housing materials between the antenna and the living quarters inside.  Even a normal dual pane window provides quite a bit of attention at these frequencies.  This is one of the reasons Verizon‚Äôs 28 GHz 5G service is struggling."
6946,qs2QcycggWU,"@@ron.v While I never actually programmed a computer with punch cards, I have carted hundreds of pounds of them to the trash.  I worked as a janitor in high school at a Western Electric plant in Millard Nebraska.  They used to load trash cans full of them which were then really hard to lift.  At my first job after the Army (where I got started as a satcom tech) we programmed IBM mainframe via CRTs and keyboards so between 1975 and 1981 the punch cards went away.  I learned System 370 assembly language, JCL (more like DOS batch file than an actual language), and APL.  Fun stuff."
6947,qs2QcycggWU,"@@RideGasGas  Thanks so much for sharing that.  I always wondered when the punch cards went away.  The only JCL I learned in school was enough for our Fortran jobs to run on the 370.  Those jobs were on punch cards during the spring quarter of 1980.  I didn't actually learn the tech behind it until Bellsouth promoted me from my job in supply to a system specialist (tier-2 support) in '85.  Most of our systems (2,000 of them by the late '90s) were AT&T UNIX minicomputers but one of the systems we supported was an app on a mainframe.  All used CRTs as you said. 

When I was in the USAF in the late '60s we supported analog computer hardware and one early digital system  In school '79-'84, I learned BASIC, PL1, and Fortran but on the job '85-'04 what little programming we needed was in shell scripts.  Nothing was compiled.  Our jobs focused on system support at the OS level.  It included datacom and front-end processors.  Your stuff was probably a lot more fun.  Ours was hands-on at first.  That was the most fun 'til we went remote in the early '90s."

6949,qs2QcycggWU,"@@johnw9585 Thanks for sharing your experience with Magnavox.  I  once read a book called ""Fumbling the Future"" about how Xerox's CEO told his Palo Alto Research  Center (PARC) that their inventions of the mouse and GUI were silly because no one would want a computer in their home.  Sometimes it seems executives are a couple French fries short of a Happy Meal."
6950,qs2QcycggWU,Can you receive tv channels and satellite channels and is a box required
6951,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mariogarza7796 Not a Starlink user, but my understanding is that it provides a connection to the Internet.  You'll be able to watch TV without any extra hardware to the extent that you have a computing device that can connect to an Internet streaming service that has the desired channels available.  For example Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, and others have bundles where you can get popular TV and movie services and pay one bill.  The alternative would be to subscribe to them ala carte.

This is different than a DISH or DirecTV satellite offering which are designed from the ground up as a broadcast TV service and require a receiver box.  Since DirecTV was acquired by AT&T I think they are pushing to deliver more of their services via fiber and other land-based methods and are bundling both Internet and TV together, or so I heard."

6954,qs2QcycggWU,19:26 it's ok if The contractive and Destructive Pattern is only one but in reality there is lots of dark and bright fringes or beams  so what happens to other un directed beam to un proper location
6955,qs2QcycggWU,They just go out into the space.  But it's possible to reduce these side lobes by having different powers sent to antennas along the edge.

6964,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is good, but mildly missleading"
6965,qs2QcycggWU,"15:05 wait a minute , i think i am getting it ....
You mean ..
 Any beam Generally spread in space by Inverse-square law so over distance it spread to many undesired location so only tiny amount reached to the receiving end 
Mean Inefficient or signal loss 
But on the other hand ...
If we use Wave interference than the wave not only Focus but they also became seprate parallel beams just like in Double slit Experiment we can see dark and Light patterns so overall all darkside beam combines to Bright side and adding up the Intensity of the signal by Constructive and Destructive manner interferences ,  otherwise same signal have to pass by filling all its wavefront plane right ?"
6966,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah.  It's rather counter intuitive, but having destructive interference somewhere means that the constructive interference elsewhere is more powerful."
6967,qs2QcycggWU,More of this please  !
6968,qs2QcycggWU,Will do!
6969,qs2QcycggWU,Basically the aperture couple patch antenna is a capacitor that allows higher frequency through. am i getting that right?

6979,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredibly well-made video.

One question: does the satellite aso do beam-forming in order to speak to each Dishy antenna individually, or does the satellite transmit more in a broadcasting way?"
6980,qs2QcycggWU,Yes- the satellite has similar beamforming antenna arrays.
6981,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation Yes, but does the satellite target each Dishy individually, or does it just use beam forming to target a specific area of earth?"
6982,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz The satellites would have to ''flood'' the earth I guess. As the earth wobbles and shakes around, the gps satellites have to flood because of that. We will be exposed like never before. not good imo."

6984,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz A familiar, civilian version of what happens can be read into by taking a look at what ""MIMO"" is, in the context of modern 802.11 wifi. I'll try to remember to come back and expand this (mobile; typing >>> swyping for this kind of writing). I'm case I do not, or if you wanted to start exploring, here's a quick topic dump and tldr. 

Phased arrays can create one powerful main lobe, but multiple main lobes of lesser strength is also possible. Clients are assigned timeslots and several clients are targeted at once. This is actually a way to harness side lobes somewhat. Rather than suppress one, augment and steer it a bit if it was already near enough to be in direction of a client. 

As for how the information is modulated so that it is meaningful to multiple discrete clients at the same time, check out a thing called OFDMA. It is fucking wild."
6985,qs2QcycggWU,@@MoritzvonSchweinitz it has to target each dishy
6986,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 Thank you! I learned a lot, I think!

So it's basically an in-between? Intead of focusing on just one Dishy at a time, a special hedgehog-shape is generated which beams to multiple Dishys at once, and the pattern is then changed to beam at a Different set of Dishys?"

6988,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth.

6991,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Do not trust these science clowns, they are hiding God from us. They have no evidence for a spinning ball earth. We are living on this Jesus-created flat earth for this whole time. If you dare , research the shape of our earth, you will be shocked."

_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic. Shame on those who believe globe earth nonsense, globers keep whining but still they don't have a single proof that earth is flying, spinning, or having curvature. 2022 is the year of waking up."
6993,qs2QcycggWU,@@Almighty_Flat_Earth I hope you are kidding/trolling?
6994,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Yes in that you are grasping the idea well. No in that it's always more complex than that. So, right now, where client density is pretty sparse, it will basically always be like that. Multiple individuals targeted each with their own lobe.

You could imagine a scenario in the future where multiple Dishys are in close enough proximity that Starlink could decide that the tradeoff (in terms of its own resource utilization: a combination of time and power etc) makes sense to schedule some TxOps with a slightly less laserlike, more conical lobe because that will cover those clients all at once more efficiently than the individual lobe route.

As another followup, if you get into some of this, much is made these days of OFDMA in context of 802.11ax, and how it will be the killer feature, and how MIMO (aka MU-MIMO) has been kind of a disappointment for wifi. Interestingly, the reason for this is that even the top end 8x8 radios are pretty coarse in their ability to beamform. Whereas Starlink, the MIMO-like aspect is doing a lot more of the heavy lifting than OFDMA. Just something I thought was interesting regarding the discourse.

edit: Clarity. To make explicit what I left to the imagination, yes, these things can be done together. So you could get ""hedghog"" patterns (love it) where all the quills are the sharpest type and the maximum number; hedgehogs where some of the quills are a touch thicker than others, but still some are the thin ones; or any variety you can imagine. 

Also, any time there is literally only one client in a beam, and this is still a little simplified and also depends on exactly how SpaceX designed the revision of Starlink in question, then essentially OFDMA doesn't do any of the heavy lifting in terms of allocating resources and isolating comms, and it's all the beamforming (""MIMO"") side. And any time clients do any beam sharing, OFDMA gets in."
6995,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 this is all so incredible! I have problems ""groking"" even a simple antenna pattern, and the voodoo priests that are RF engineers are doing all of that crazy stuff.

Do you know by any chance how many ""quills"" are feasible per phased array? I imagine the calculations needed to generate a specific hedgehog pattern would get exponentially more complex?"
6996,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz You're thinking the right way about it. So, at some point, computational complexity would be a limiting factor, even if everything else going on would permit additional quills. 

""Everything else"" includes things like, for example, what is just possible at all, as a matter of beamforming because of the physics of it -- you can imagine an array with 1280 elements has limitations that an array of 2560 (etc) would not run into. And the intensity* of each quill needs to be comfortably above the background noise. Simultaneous quills must naturally share the power output of the array. 

[*So, not sharpness, as that's our metaphor for more and less pinpoint-targeted lobes; rather, the amount of power sent into that lobe. One solo quill can get the whole of the array's power, and such a signal can be seen in even relatively adverse environments; think, jamming attempts in the context of Dishys deployed in Ukraine, say.]

Additionally, taking some of our knowledge here a layer deeper, at the expense of the metaphor a bit, using all the array elements to form one main lobe? That is the most focused the beam can be. Creating multiple beams means they will, all of them, be duller/blunter/less focused/you get the idea I hope. If 1280 elements can create a tightness of focus of [X], creating 4 otherwise identical beams simultaneously would work out to be, in terms of the beam,  analogous to that which could be made by a system with the same engineering and architecture and only 320 elements. (This is not quite right and the video itself alludes to the existence of some factors that scale a bit superlinearly but it's not wildly important now.)

So note then, there's two penalties in terms of delivering a clear signal to a target when you send multiple quills. The power is already shared between them, *and* the cross-sectional area is larger. 

(Bonus: You might notice the penalty from the former looks like it scales linearly, whereas the latter at least quadratically. As such, not exact figures but to convey the idea: You could imagine a tradeoff where 1 to 4 or so Dishys in close proximity get individual dwells, but 5+ in the same area is a tipping point where it would save resources to create one larger dwell, just in terms of delivering received power intensity.)

Hopefully this tickles your brain better than the more literal answer to your question, which wouldn't be possible to provide without making use of non-public information (which, even if one had access to it, would be a big no-no)."

Typically QAM is reserved for terestrial lines like coax which is 256 QAM. The signal to space is usually too dirty but the low orbit makes it possible. Typical SATCOM to geostationary satellites run QPSK or 8PSK.

7035,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent presentation!  25 years ago this was Classified technology used on phased-array RADAR systems that could scan the sky in 360 degrees thousands of times a second and could see a bird 20 miles away.  This technology is still in use today on Navel vessels and by NORAD to scan the skies.  If you look you can see them as very large circular or hexagon shaped pads on the sides of the ship.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Phased_Array_Radar

A VERY simplified version of this, phase-steerable antenna systems, have been used by ham radio operators for years but they are limited in resolution to only several degrees."
7036,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the additional info!!  Perhaps someday I'll dive more into phased array radar.
7037,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation The principle is virtually identical to StarLink but steered much more quickly and with much higher resolution.  Usually it's at around 24GHz-36GHz.  Much higher and you get into atmospheric absorption of the signals (usually oxygen and water vapor); lower bands limit the resolution.
7038,qs2QcycggWU,"quality video, great content and tech"

7043,qs2QcycggWU,there are 2 generations of the Dish now.  we used gen1
7044,qs2QcycggWU,"As an EE engineer, RF stuff is a black magic to most of us. Capacitor stop being a capacitor, open circuit may become short circuit. You can design a LPF using only bare PCB. That's insane.

The fact that Starlink sells at ""cheap"" price amazes me. They are cutting edge technology."
7045,qs2QcycggWU,It definitely is crazy how cheap it is!  Who knows what tech will drop in cost in 10 years.

7077,qs2QcycggWU,"Great explanation of phased array antenna (first saw them in the US Navy many years ago).  And a lot about how 'dishy' steers to the satellite.  But what about the other direction?

How can a satellite with only a few phased-array transmitter antenna 'download' to some hundreds of customers simultaneously?  Is it 'steering' toward each 'dishy' in a round-robin method?  Or just broadcasting to a swath of ground under it?   How does my 'dishy' separate my download signal from my neighbors just a few hundred feet away?  Would love to see some more info on that side of the communication link."
7078,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a super fan (and supporter) of your work and yesterday when I saw you were doing a Starlink project I literally got excited.  Your work as a teacher and story teller are best of class and I love how you‚Äôve given some deep perspectives on some of the technology ingredients that are easily taken for granted.  I‚Äôd love you continue your exploration of Starlink by discussing how once the data makes it to the ground station some how it traverses the internet to its destination server.  Another video topic I‚Äôd love to see is how these massive data centers such as Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft Azure, or Meta process data in a global network of data centers.  (Hint hint)l.

The dis also has a heating element that in winter melts snow and ice off of the unit. The directions had no words, only three pictures that a 5 year old could follow. Starlink and Musk did a great job on this!"
7085,qs2QcycggWU,What problems / disruptions if any have you encountered so far with this system?
7086,qs2QcycggWU,"@@yahshua1110 no disruptions in rain or snow, but every sunday it seems they do maintenance that cause some issues on those evenings...otherwise it has been flawless"
7087,qs2QcycggWU,@@TheLazyM Good to know. I'm lucky to have fiber but for those in rural areas it must be amazing. The maintenance issues will probably subside when they get any bugs out and it goes mainstream.

7127,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. Thanks for explaining it in detail. Had one question, What really happens at the satellite end while transmitting? Since many dishes are receiving the the data from a single satellite, how the beam is steered? How is it able to serve so many dishes with just two antennas?"

7139,qs2QcycggWU,Really good
7140,qs2QcycggWU,"The idea that phase array multiplies the total energy is false, they still radiate all around them, the strength is multiplied in one direction and all of the spherical radiation is wasted. You lose power in total but get one strong beam out of it. Also, the destructive interference pattern is not full, we get plenty of secondary beams... that can be used to monitor your internet traffic."
7141,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, great info!   subbed."

7146,qs2QcycggWU,"The video mentions H.264, which requires 5 Mbit/s for HD quality. One way to alleviate congestion of Starlink could be to have a cache on Dishy that downloads the videos that the user is subscribed to in YouTube when the network is less loaded. It could maybe detect users sharing interests in a given area and broadcast the data, instead of sending it individually."
7147,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are just awesome .

7170,qs2QcycggWU,"i don't know what's more breathtaking here: engineering behind Starlink technology (rather: combination of old ideas like beamforming stuffed into one pair of devices) or amount of simplifications contained herein allowing majority to understand concepts while not ommiting interesting details allowing to actually understand concepts' principles. 
No to forget visuals without which understanding interferences would be much harder. Great work!"
7171,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video. It's mind boggling to me how so many antennas are so precisely coordinated. I suppose the lengths of all the pcb traces from the control chips to the antennas need to be accounted for.  How would such precision be achieved? It only takes a few picoseconds for current to travel one cm.

7200,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation via beautiful animation
7201,qs2QcycggWU,Unfortunately due to the limited bandwidth only a limited number of users in each user cell can access the satellite at one time. This is fine in rural or remote regions of low population but not in larger urban regions. Even Elon Musk stated that Starlink was aimed at mainly these rural and remote users that have little or limited internet accessibility.  In the cities you can bet it's only the government and financial institutions that will access the satellites while the rest of us get by on fibre optic or landline based communications for internet.

explanatory video about how the Starlink satellites 
build their local network. 

How they maintain their local neighborhood network. 
How they bring a new Saiellite into their local 
network and let another one out. 

How each satellite aligns its Laser Communication 
Units (how many LCUs does each satellite have?) 
with its neighbors (how many neighbors does a 
satellite have?) and what information it needs to 
send a long signal sequence to a dishy and then, 
if necessary, pass that signal sequence on to 
a neighboring satellite. 

So what is the signal path of a long sequence 
from a base station on earth to a user somewhere 
on earth and from there back to the base station.

How does it come about, how is it preserved?"

7230,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content!  ü•∞üá®üá¶üá∫üá∏
7231,qs2QcycggWU,comment!
7232,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe you guys modeled and animated this all out. Very educational stuff.
7233,qs2QcycggWU,Nicely done.  Thanks for all the research and polishing.
7234,qs2QcycggWU,This is hands down the best educational YouTube video I have seen. Thank you so much for creating this video. I have EE background and man.. It‚Äôs amazing.. really. Thank you. Thank you
7235,qs2QcycggWU,Dang this is cool

7237,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing details and excellent efforts on taking complex processes and making them understandable. I knew when my Dishy arrived and I plugged it in, the hardware was light years beyond anything I'd seen before. Now that I know it's even more elaborate than I could ever imagine, I'm going to pay homage by watching Netflix and not focus on how it works."
7238,qs2QcycggWU,"Really love this video I had to watch it 3 times!
Great job branch education!
I Really absorb some knowledge!
Thanks"
7239,qs2QcycggWU,The technology and explanation are both supreme
7240,qs2QcycggWU,Great presentation... Guess this explains why the antenna cost so much... Interested in knowing how the antenna used in an airplane is configured & sized...
7241,qs2QcycggWU,These gadgets are EXACTLY the same as I was trying to build with my Legos when I was eleven!
7242,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating! Excellent! Hurrah!
7243,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blown.
Any info with regards to blockchain?"
7244,qs2QcycggWU,"That's heck of a lot of information in such a short video, nice job"
7245,qs2QcycggWU,most RF technology is basically magic
7246,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible content. Informative, clean animations, just the right amount of detail, and the audio is perfect. Thanks for all the hard work that went in to this video. I very much enjoyed the knowledge share."
7247,qs2QcycggWU,PERFECT! THX!
7248,qs2QcycggWU,"that clarified me not only starlink, also other antennas; thanks!"
7249,qs2QcycggWU,"this channel should have atleast 20m subscribers, now i know why there's crowd in parlours and not in libraries"
7250,qs2QcycggWU,"Unbelievably clear explanation of several complex technologies.
I feel enlightened!"
7251,qs2QcycggWU,I'm mind blown by this fascinating full of simple information YouTube video
7252,qs2QcycggWU,"I think the most impressive part of the video is at 6:55 where they properly model electricity around a wire. Since most don‚Äôt know that current and charge , which is a lot of what electricity is to my understanding, actually occurs in a field around a conductor. When asked with how does power go through a cable most think it travels inside the metal conductor which is not entirely false as electrons do still bounce off atoms in one direction depending on the charge."
7253,qs2QcycggWU,excellent explanation!
7254,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
7255,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7256,qs2QcycggWU,"waw i have never seen anything explained so comprehensively well! you are very good. i did'nt follow the advice of doing it in two shot of different higher speed, but i gawked at the idea of the proposition xD thank you very much. 
In the dark age of influencers, you are upping youtube's meaningfulness"
7257,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video quality! Well done! I can imagine the deep technical knowledge and research done behind the video, but still kept it simple and understandable yet for the everyday person. Bravo."
7258,qs2QcycggWU,"trees block wifi because they say your signal sucks, wrap access points around their trunks and get global wifi and plug in by wire around tree internet ... TADA"
7259,qs2QcycggWU,using wires arond trees one could broacst internet around the world .. using a wire around any tree one could have internet anywhere ...
7260,qs2QcycggWU,"Next level mix of visuals and in-depth explanations, bravo! The only thing I‚Äôd say is off is that electrons don‚Äôt travel as fast in the conductors as your visuals suggest when we go on picoseconds scale, electric field however does transmit change of potential at the speed of light."
7261,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation... I always wondered how they keep track of satellites.
7262,qs2QcycggWU,"I grew up watching The Discovery Channel back when it was...well, about discovery. Now that media is moving in a different direction I've always wondered how and if kids now a days will get a fair chance at being exposed to science in an engaging way, and I must say this video does not disappoint."

7264,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome animated explanation. Thanks
7265,qs2QcycggWU,Antidote
7266,qs2QcycggWU,How does the satellite point to many dishes at once?
7267,qs2QcycggWU,"Thing is it does not need, client fishes need that to be low power, while satellites have a lot more power so they can just send stronger signal, same as tv satellites signal feeding large land surface. It for not use directional antennas, it also not require to use beam forming, but it technically could use that to optimize signal distribution by satelite dishes sending gps coordinate, as explained in video dish has gps and it knows where it is. In fact there proof it actually does that as they block of service when you move dish too far from your home. So signal spreads like a dome and an be received from any point in range of signal. 
On single signal, you can send data to multiple devices via multiplexing, by giving air time for specific device target it and switch between them, data is addressed so receiver knows it should decode this data not other one. this is basic concept used in most wireless technologies, wifi, cell network, thats also how digital tv let you have multiple channels same frequency and why digital tv can have more channels overall. The same thing in cables, like ethernet, router simply directs forward data to right device or to another router or switch to distribute data feather. So it a concept used in communication technologiesoverall."
7268,qs2QcycggWU,"@@ShadowriverUB Nice, thanks."
7269,qs2QcycggWU,"Sub'd, liked & commented - well done!"
7270,qs2QcycggWU,Thx for explaining starlink. It brought back memories of when i was in electronics school way back in the 70's. I was wondering though... why was the dish changed from round to rectangular?
7271,qs2QcycggWU,great content.   just brilliant
7272,qs2QcycggWU,incredible work as always
7273,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you man!

7275,qs2QcycggWU,"GREAT video, guys! Definitely appreciate the time you took in doing the research :)"
7276,qs2QcycggWU,The amplitude modulation doesn't fade before reaching the satellite?

7281,qs2QcycggWU,These videos make my nerdy heart sing.
7282,qs2QcycggWU,Your videos are just amazing.. Every single video blows my mind. Description is really easy to understand (almost) and animation is simply top notch. Kudos to the entire team.
7283,qs2QcycggWU,"It is amazing how such technically complex can look so simple and direct. I am looking at Starlink for my next service, once we move out of town."
7284,qs2QcycggWU,super
7285,qs2QcycggWU,Now I know!  Great video!
7286,qs2QcycggWU,"For the people who appreciate such things, this is one the greatest videos on YouTube"
7287,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this video!!
I have subscribed to the channel and I am going to check out Brilliant.

Can you describe please, are the satellites rotating up there, or spinning on an axis somehow?
I am wondering about the ""mechanics"" of why we see them ""flare"" up there in the night sky when they go by sometimes.

Thank you very much."
7288,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowingüî• How much electricital power is needed for the antenna to send one bit?
7289,qs2QcycggWU,"Re: ‚ÄúDon't Let DISH Disable Your Internet - VoterVoice.‚Äù Around July 6, Elon tweeted that Dish‚Äôs excessive hoarding of 12GHz channels will kill Starlink (& revenues needed to sustain SpaceX/Starships). How is that going?"

7292,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video! Thanks a lot
7293,qs2QcycggWU,It‚Äôs hard to believe that it is that complicated
7294,qs2QcycggWU,Good educational video
7295,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the best explanation of phased array antennas that I have ever seen, especially from a layman's point of view.  Great job!"
7296,qs2QcycggWU,It feels like I actually understood something rather than in some discovery channel documentary about any physical/technological topic where they simplify so much that you can't really understand it and they interview a dozen scientists making emotional statements about how marvelous and mysterious it all is.
7297,qs2QcycggWU,"Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once againüòÅ solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
7298,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing thing about this video, is it explains what  defence departments around the world spend so much money on. The amount of effort in phased array applications in electronic warfare are insane!!! Billions and billions of $$"
7299,qs2QcycggWU,AT & T ARCHIVES -A 20 YEAR HISTORY OF ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILES - from 1962 will show phased array radar using a multiplicity of microprocessors to track and intercept all missiles with 100% accuracy - this tech is 60 years old // AS A FORMER HOG FARMER IM SURPRISED HOW WELL THEY DUPLICATED A 60 YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY

That much lovely animations need a lot of time and perfection for preparation...
But you have nailed it!
Great work...and I love that dedication ‚ù§Ô∏è"
7305,qs2QcycggWU,I did the mistake of watching this full video in the normal speed instead of the advised fast forward speed and my brain is overloaded. But I seriously enjoyed it. One question I have is if a phase shift is introduced in the QAM stage and other phase shift during the beamform steering stage then how are the two phase shifts are recognised?? Won't they just combine together and like mess up the signal?? Is it possible that the signal transmitted also contains the information of the phase shift which is then received and then phase shift is reversed according to the info received??
7306,qs2QcycggWU,The phase shifts combine but they combine in a way that is understandable. The phase shifts in QAM are separated by time and the phase shifts in the array are separated by space. Care has to be taken so that things do not interfere with each other. There are complicated rules that prevent signal from one time frame to not interfere with the signals of other time frames. Similarly the shift on each tiny antenna needs to be calculated precisely to prevent them from canceling each other's signal.
7307,qs2QcycggWU,Despite you continuing to call it that annoying name. Its not a good or cool name. its stupid and lame. good video
7308,qs2QcycggWU,"Haha.  Part of the reason is because 'Dishy' is shorter than saying 'the Satellite Dish' or 'the Dish'  thus saving time.  When you have a 28min video with of all text, ya save time where you can."
7309,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video

7326,qs2QcycggWU,This video is freaking amazing!!!!
7327,qs2QcycggWU,Clickbait
7328,qs2QcycggWU,Is it tho?
7329,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing, your videos never fail to leave me amazed at human ingenuity."
7330,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, thank you!"
7331,qs2QcycggWU,this video is an absolute materpiece
7332,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video!  One minor correction(?) on the four panels on the satellite...they are all Ku-band user traffic.  Three are used for downlink, and one is used for uplink.  (This is also consistent with the asymmetric up/down traffic.)  The two mechanically-steered dishes are used for Ka-band traffic to the gateways.  At least as far as I understand, since there's no official documentation."
7333,qs2QcycggWU,"Huh.  I'll 100% research into this more, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were correct.  There have been so few technical specs on the satellite thus it makes me hesitant to do a satellite deep detailed explanation.  If you know of any solid sources for satellite specs, send them over.  Also- of course, there'll never be a satellite teardown as getting hold of one is impossible."
7334,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation yap uplink gateways use a steared direct dishes in protective domes to send all users data to a sat and there's 6-9 of them to be linked to different sats
7335,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice explanation & video however how much more effort would it take to also use miles equivalent to kilometers so you don't have to use a conversion table.  Seems to be
7336,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah.  I should have put the conversion in a corner note.

7345,qs2QcycggWU,mind=blown.
7346,qs2QcycggWU,"After watching this entire video, i felt a warm feeling of satisfaction and the way Neo felt, when he learnt Kungfu in Matrix"
7347,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing scripting and production value. Thanks so much!
7348,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a couple of questions.   With all these millions or more beams that will be eventually be going through the atmosphere, will there be any negativity or harm to it and people, insects and animals?
Second question .  All these thousands of satellites, if a collision were to happen between them or from other satellites or even a meteor,couldn‚Äôt that cause a shot gun effect sending millions of high speed peaces hitting other satellites causing a domino effect which maybe make it extremely difficult and dangerous for launching anything including people into space because of a blanket of debris that could surround or envelope our planet ?"
7349,qs2QcycggWU,"For the first question - the answer would be no, because much much more ""beams"" come from our Sun. It is emitting significantly more energy on the visible wavelength which is in hundreds of THz not (GHz). The Starlinks uses aprox. 12 GHz which is much smaller frequency than visible light. So if visible light does not harm people, insects or animals, so does the starlink with much smaller energy and frequency."
7350,qs2QcycggWU,"Also to add to Kryzsztof.  Different wavelengths have different amounts of energy in them, and specifically the higher the frequency = more energy = more dangerous.  e.g. for UV you gotta wear sunscreen.  Whereas the entire opposite side, radio waves has MUCH less energy = no danger.  As for satellites- the Low Earth orbit results in these satellites burning up in the atmo much more easily in the case of collisions."
7351,qs2QcycggWU,"Why isn't anyone annoyed by the fact that inital iterations requiring so many ground stations renders the low atmosphere infraestructure useless. 
Musk should be penalized per every kg of combustion burned to deploy unnecessary infrastructure."

7356,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!
7357,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video -- one minor nitpick: It is not the case that 2 of the Phased Array's on the satellites are used for ground station communication. There are 2 parabolic antennas on each satellite for ground station communication. It is likely that 3 of the phased array antennas are TX, and 1 is RX given the spacing."
7358,qs2QcycggWU,"Gotta research this more, but I'll add this to the errata."

You've done an amazing job at explaining 64QAM, and other technical details to the public in this video, even though we engineering students have to spend an entire semester for learning it ground up. I am truly impressed that you could explain such complex topics in such simple terms. Keep up the good work."
7437,qs2QcycggWU,I love these videos.
7438,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!  We appreciate it!!  64 QAM was simplified as mentioned in the video, but hopefully, it'll inspire someone to pursue EE themselves."
7439,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best videos.
7440,qs2QcycggWU,"TV Satellites do not orbit the earth, if they did no one would receive a signal with their fixed dish. TV Satellites are geostationary so appear to be in a fixed positon in the sky hence people being able to aim their dishes at them and lock them in that position."
7441,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding work. Talk about Revolutionary technology. I‚Äôm sure the military might have it years ago but it took Elon to bring it to the masses.
7442,qs2QcycggWU,Question! How on earth you could know all these things?

7460,qs2QcycggWU,Hell yes I'll leave a comment üëç
7461,qs2QcycggWU,You said ask anything so.. How is it possible to use the phase shifting technique for both controlling the beamforming and determining the data? If I need the beam at a certain phase but the data requires a different one what's going to happen?
7462,qs2QcycggWU,Such a simple explanation for way too complicated subject of wireless communication. Really appreciate your efforts to simplify things down to this level. Thank you so much. I learned something new today.
7463,qs2QcycggWU,That's great to hear!
7464,qs2QcycggWU,"Beam strengthening requires phase shifting but QAM also uses phase shifting to encode signa, so how it is resolved not to destroy data send when beam changes angel?"

7481,qs2QcycggWU,"I am amazed how Elon Musk is doing so much different mind blowing technical leaps in 1 time. He has not a single company but a dozen, each blowing every competitor away, and combine it also it with it's own rockets and his own satellites to reduce the costs. He is in so many types mind blowing technology that he single handling the tech race to a new point. 

I can hardly understand this already simplified video but he and his workforce is inventing the new world everything from top to bottom and back..."
7482,qs2QcycggWU,Those brilliant engineers who work for Elon's company did all of this tech. He is an entrepreneur he can't do this complicated physic and math.
7483,qs2QcycggWU,"@@hamka1288Yes without them they wouldn't be successful. However i praise Elons entrepreneurship doing all those thing and bring everything together to make this possible. There are companies that fail because as simple as 2 people can't work together. 

Elon put the best people, resources everything together to make things possible like NASA couldn't bring a man to the ISS. How would that go now with Russia's war on Ukraine as an sample. NASA funded with billions couldn't build a rocket for bringing people in space."

If there is a second  video in this series, please cover (if possible) the process in which the user terminal is seamlessly transferred from satellite to satellite.  My suspicion is that doppler shift at 12GHz is a substantial challenge. (?)"
7487,qs2QcycggWU,"There's definitely a doppler shift, but a good question as to how much.   Hopefully, eventually, we'll get into the satellite more."
7488,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video to introduce a complex technology to common people, it brings many science domains in a single piece, the animations are very well designed to visualize what underneath real life. Thanks for sharing."

7491,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant thanks much!
7492,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
7493,qs2QcycggWU,How many antennas in the new smaller rectangle dish?
7494,qs2QcycggWU,"I like your ""break-down"".  And it even seems a ""no-brainer"" when it comes to talk between the sender me(customer) to the satellite.  But on the other end.  When the satellite is the sender.  How many customers can one satellite handle at a time?  Your video mentioned that a satellite has (4) antennas.  But I'm pretty sure the limit doesn't stop at (4).  SO, where does it stop?  And WHY?  And how does that part work?"
7495,qs2QcycggWU,That topic is very complicated. First you have TDMA or time division multiple access. Every user have a time schedule where they are allowed to transmit or received. Then you have FDMA frequency division multiple access. Each user is assign a slightly different frequency to transmit and received. Then we have CDMA code division multiple access. It Is a mathematical trick where each user is assigned a numerical key and these key is use to transmit and received signal without interference. OFDMA orthogonal frequency division multiple access it is sort of all the above techniques combine. The entire channel is divided into chunks or sub channel using all the tricks to pack as many subchannel as possible. MIMO multi input multi output this uses multiple antenna to serve different users. With phase array you can have MaMIMO Massive MIMO uses more than a hundred antenna per user to gain more efficiency. NOMA non orthogonal multiple access. This has yet to be implemented in real world application but it uses different power levels for each user and signal has to be process to remove the signal with different power. I don't know which technique Starlink uses but to get maximum number of user it has to be a combination of OFDMA and MIMO.
7496,qs2QcycggWU,"@@kazedcat I'm with you.  And it makes a lot of sense.  Except, the question that remains is.  (How many)?  How many subscribers can ONE satellite entertain, while keeping the user base up to 1Gbps down at least."
7497,qs2QcycggWU,@@vangildermichael1767 Currently per satelite is limited to 40Gbps that gets divided to how many active user is connected to the satellite. It was originally limited to 20Gbps but newer satellites has twice the bandwidth. Future bandwidth improvement will be done by increasing the number of satellites. Starship will carry larger satellite so there is a potential of increase per satellite bandwidth capacity once the Starship rocket starts carrying satellites to orbit. Assuming the satellite lifted by Starship gets another doubling that will be 80Gbps per satellite.
7498,qs2QcycggWU,"@@kazedcat And (on the surface), that doesn't seem like much (40 Gbps).  Until, I realize, that each user is only on there for a nanosecond.  So, when the method goes around, 40 Gbps is enough for well over an hundred people."
7499,qs2QcycggWU,@@vangildermichael1767 This is why Starlink plans to have 40 thousand satellite. Even with that many satellite. Starlink could not cover the entire population of highly dense cities. I think they also have license application for use of higher frequency but frequency above 30Ghz needs a lot of power to overcome atmospheric attenuation.
7500,qs2QcycggWU,*Sir make a video on how does reusable rocket work üôÇ*
7501,qs2QcycggWU,Sir please make more videos on engineering üòç
7502,qs2QcycggWU,"As you add more and more of these one next to another at each home, how does the destructive interference not interfere with the other antennas?"
7503,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good video. But I would call this video more of ""How a Starlink Terminal works"". I think you can do another video of how it works overall. You did not explain why there are Ground Stations, what they do, and why they are needed. Then you can add why the version 1.5 satellites are important with the laser communications between the satellites are important. Why it does not work over large spans of water / ocean (at least not right now)."
7504,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, you guys really knock these videos out of the park. Like these are the most detailed and best explanations of technology I can find anywhere on the internet. Absolutely keep up the great work, love it."
7505,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  We appreciate it.
7506,qs2QcycggWU,"That is absolutely awesome! This could be a part 1 Starlink Series... The other part, 2, could be how that 10000+ Starlink Satellites communicate with each other, when it reach to this number. I heard that, in the future, they will be able to receive data from the initial Dishy, talk to each other over the space till the destination and head back in the same way to the initial Dishy, making the fastest communication ever. For instance, from America to Asia, the initial Dishy in Earth sends data to Satellite in Space that sends data to another Dishy in the Earth that sends it again to another Satellite in space till it reaches Asia and heads back to the initial Dishy in America using the same process. It could face Death interferences. But with Starlink Satellites talking to each other, the data leaves the initial Dishy in America,reaches the first Satellite that sends it to another Satellite, traveling on just only in space, till it gets to Asia. I think no Earthling interference during the process will be fantastic! I am sorry, I am not good at explaining things but... Well thank you very much for this wonderful video and channel Branch Education!"
7507,qs2QcycggWU,Indeed! In the future we're planning on making a really comprehensive video on what's inside the satellite.
7508,qs2QcycggWU,As if there is only 1 dishy per satellite. In reality the satellites transmit to  hundreds if not thousands of dishies.
7509,qs2QcycggWU,Really great video!!
7510,qs2QcycggWU,This is one of the best videos that this channel has ever made
7511,qs2QcycggWU,22:50 how changing in phase for coding  doesnt cause to changing the oriantation of tha waves ? As you told for tracking the sattelites
7512,qs2QcycggWU,The intricacies of how that works is ü§Ø. I hope we could have that in my country.
7513,qs2QcycggWU,"Beam Steering. What you showed was a 2D Beam Steering, yeah? Does Dishy do 3D Beam Steering? I can't figure out how it would be 3D by just manipulating a phase shift."

7516,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7517,qs2QcycggWU,"What a pleasure to watch <3 well made and very interesting!
But what is not clear for me is how the satellite can send so many different signals to many different dishes? It has just 2 sending dishes right?"

Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth.

Globe liars got busted once againüòÅ solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST.

7531,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation If earth and atmosphere spin 1600 KMph in the eastward direction, then flights traveling west at max speed 1000 KMph, must be having hard time to cruise and would never reach its westward destination. But in real life scenario, flights reach the destinations between A and B at the same duration regardless of the direction. This one fact alone is enough to prove that the earth is NOT a spinning ball, but rather a flat disk.. Globe model is illuminati deception, and it's been busted.. checkmate.."
7532,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation  Satellites don't exist. GPS not working in ocean. GPS is just the triangulation of cell towers. Internet cables are buried under the ocean. Time to wake up. Trust your senses..
_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth.

_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic.

7564,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool. Hard topic shown with ease. Simplifications at proper level to understand the concept. The hardest and more detailed part was implemented by full time employees at Starlink. I guess the steering committee don't have much broader general idea than this explained here (of course they know much more, but in other areas). Thank you!"

7567,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, this is a fantastic video. I have a question. How is the 64QAM implemented if the phase is already shifting to form the beam?"
7568,qs2QcycggWU,"The phase shift for beam forming is relative to each antenna. The 64QAM phase shift is global to all antennas. So if you have a signal going in with phase 0, that could be sin(t + 0). Then pointing forward, two antennas would have: sin(t + 0), and sin(t + 0) as well. Now if you point to the right, then the antennas may be sin(t+0) and sin(t+45), respectively. Then when you phase shift the main signal for 64QAM, it may shift to sin(t+30), where pointing forward the two antennas would be sin(t+30) and sin(t+30). Pointing to the right again, they would be sin(t+30) and sin(t+30+45). 
That may sound like a lot of work, but it's done in steps. First the main signal is shifted and modulated as per 64QAM and then distributed to each of the front-ends. The front ends then individually apply an additional shift for bream-forming. Essentially, the signal being transmitted (or received) and its phase shift are independent from the phase shift used by beamforming."

7584,qs2QcycggWU,"I first encountered phase steering 40 years ago. It's amazing to see how far it's come.

Likewise the first 64QAM kit I used back then was a 7 foot tall 19 inch rack for 140Mb/s @ 12GHz terrestrial linking and only went 20km. 3 years later there were 7 of them in the same 7 foot tall rack

Each rack drew close to 3kW for 200mW transmit power


As an aside, audio modems used 64QAM for 33k6 and DSL uses hundreds of discrete 64 QAM carriers. The difference is the carrier frequency and symbol rate"

7650,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah- I found out also that it's in 5G, but decided to focus on the other fields- like mid-flight internet because 5G is a little heated of a topic on YouTube."
7651,qs2QcycggWU,5G is actually a lot more complicated because of multipathing. So the transmitter does not have the advantage of knowing the exact angle and direction to send the signal. This is a limitation of Starlink communication there must be a clear path with no obstruction between the dish and the satellite. 5g can work around obstructions.

7663,qs2QcycggWU,one of the most underrated channels in yt community...i pray that you guys deserve a hell lot of reach and you guys rightfully deserve so i loved the explanation and animation
7664,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a stunningly good explanation, huge thanks from this retired nerd! . Its amazing how simple and reliable SpaceX have made this highly complex technology to use. I know a few people here in NZ with Starlink, and it absolutely rocks for our relatively tiny rural population. One friend had his zero-techie wife unbox and set it up, and within 5 mins they had 250 Mbps. And even the US military were gobsmacked by how SpaceX managed to drop in 000's of terminals into the Ukraine military 2-3 days after the war broke out, and completely neutralise Russian's prior mega attack on the Ukrainians' Viasat satellite military comms system. The Ukraine military now have the world's best integrated comms system for weapons targeting and control, and Starlink is one of the key reasons (along with Ukrainian tech brilliance). The Russians also tried to radio-jam the Starlink terminals, but Starlink downloaded a patch to all terminals immediately to stop this jamming in its tracks. Starlink is now Ukraine's military backbone as well as providing wifi internet to 100,000+ Ukrainians in areas where the Russians have destroyed the mobile infrastructure. And, amazingly, these hugely complex terminals can all run off a 12V vehicle cigarette lighter."
7665,qs2QcycggWU,The situation in the Ukraine is not of Russia's making. It is all down to NATO aggression which is led by the US and the UK. Agreements and commitments were not honoured by NATO. It takes brilliant minds to build this technology but it takes commonsense to stop us all getting killed and you people seem to be lacking in that.üå±
7666,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah.. but not. This will not help the Ukrainian, Nazi authorities. You have no idea what signal jamming is. A patch alone can't fix it. For Russia, it does not cause any inconvenience, the presence of Starlink access points for Ukrainians. Ukrainians need this in many ways only to send fakes to the West. Each access point is a transceiver. If this transmitter is located in a special operation zone, it will be localized and destroyed. Over time, depending on legislative decisions, these access points will be taken away from the population, or deactivated."
7667,qs2QcycggWU,"Even tho it took forever, it was a super fun video to research because of just how impressively complex it is. I agree, it's soo awesome how this tech is helping out the Ukrainians defend their country.  It's also crazy to think that this tech was designed by a fewer than 1000 engineers."
7668,qs2QcycggWU,You need to reread history of Ukraine and check your propaganda sources. You will find that all of Zelenskyy's and Azov data is monitored.
7669,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation you did a great job! Have you noticed the two panicked Russian trolls in my replies?üòÇ
7670,qs2QcycggWU,"And when the Ukrainians needed their Dishies to respond fast enough for a moving vehicle, Starlink flipped a switch and it worked for everyone around the world, even after they told the rest of us it was a feature that ""maybe"" would happen in the future."
7671,qs2QcycggWU,IF IT IS THAT GOOD - HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
7672,qs2QcycggWU,"@@thatguy-art6229 
Because Ukraine President Zelenski said so.   In no uncertain words. According to Zelensky's office when Musk was asked to help, he had the first terminals in Ukraine THE NEXT DAY!  Over ten thousand StarLink terminals have now been delivered with still more on the way.  Ukrainians on the ground are reporting that the ease with which these are employed is amazing."
7673,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation Upon the shoulders of giants. Military and commercial did the heavy financial lifting in making phased array useful. Starlink made it economical.
7674,qs2QcycggWU,"I think this is a really poor, often wrong (on the antenna gain for example) , explanation of how a phased array antenna (an old concept) work, wikipedia does a much better work at it.

7720,qs2QcycggWU,For the algorithm
7721,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for producing this.
7722,qs2QcycggWU,"Honestly, I'm more interested in how the Starlink satellites communicate with a central network. I would assume that all of them are in visual range of at least one other at all times. I assume that they transmit the signals through each other until it reaches one that is over a ground station. But I'd love to learn exactly how that process works. How much additional latency does that add to the signal? How many ground stations are there?

I'd also be interested in how the Starlink satellite itself is able to communicate with multiple dishes. If one is over say New York, or some densely populated area, how does that affect its bandwidth for each individual receiver? In this video, you said that it has two uplink and two downlink dishes, so how would it manage to communicate with multiple users with only two downlinks? Initilly I thought it would utilize a time share like process. But that would essentially mean each users bandwidth is halved for each additional user connected to that same satellite, which seems infeasible. Most wireless networks would dedicate a certain number of channels at slightly different frequencies, but is this even possible for Starlink? Does it need to direct its beam like the ground base dishes have to? That would seem to make channels effectively useless. Or, does it have a stronger more complex method of transmitting signals that does not require the beam to be directed?"
7723,qs2QcycggWU,"The eventual plan is for laser links to route traffic between the satellites, but don't think this is working yet. Currently I believe the data is sent to a groundstation within the same footprint. It then gets routed to the local internet. Starlink is a contended service so data rate is time sliced. If the satellites phased array is made using similar design, it doesn't look possible to send multiple beams to different users at the same time(5G does this). Hence it's likely time sliced. There are reports now of users data rates suffering significantly in heavily subscribed areas that back this up. A key question for starlinks viability it how it can gain enough subscribers to foot the bill for all those launches without diluting the data rate to the point where it becomes unusable."
7724,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a solid understanding of electronic circuits in general, but the complexity of the Starlink satellite system totally blows my mind. The electronic circuits that are used to transmit and receive extremely high-frequency signals are quite different from common circuits found in your average consumer electronic gadgets. Thankfully, Branch Education makes understanding complex subjects like this one much easier and more thoroughly than if I tried to learn them on my own. Thank you VERY MUCH Branch Education!"

if they then go and build shit and use their knowledge to accomplish useful things , if they then go and help the world with the knowledge that they know if they make a difference in some way in the world that positively impacts the world  THEY ARE BY DEFINITION ""AN ENGINEER""

You build antenna's from the ground up, THAT'S AN ENGINEER.
the discipline is Communications, therefore you are a Communications engineer . if you posses the engineering knowledge to build the antenna, if it works, if you give it to the world for practical use you are a communications engineer, simple as that

I find people tend to get oversensitive about not stating things that they don't have a degree for 
in saying that, i have seen many come out of a degree and know very little, to the point where i would not agree they are engineers
the degree is not the decider of whether one is or isn't an engineer
THE KNOWLEDGE WE POSSES , 
WHAT WE DO WITH IT 
Decides if we are engineers or not, and what i have learned over a few decades is ... the one conclusive way to decide if you are an engineer is OTHER ENGINEERS HAVE TO AGREE THAT YOU ARE AN ENGINEER
There is no degree, there is no bullshit, there is nothing you can pay for , it's just a simple fact of..... Show us what you can do and we'll decide if you are.

and that way the term will always have respect and mean something

You're a communications engineer mate (on top of whatever else you are)"
7743,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Actually, someone who designs antennas would be called an RF engineer."
7744,qs2QcycggWU,"@@brianbaker876 
i know that, although he didn't say he was an RF Engineer he said he was an Antenna Engineer and my point was there is no Uni course called ""Antenna Engineering"".
it sounded strange and out of place, usually indicating that one is new to the field or that they are full of shit, that was my other point"
7745,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Telecom describes the general overall field of moving bits around, while an antenna üì° engineer specializes in the wireless aspect of telecommunications.

yeah, that's called an ""R.F. Applications Engineer""  Not an Antenna Engineer.
As i said earlier, many months ago, there is no course of degree called Antenna Engineering, there is however R.F. Applications Engineering"

OK, What country are you in ?"
7751,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Hello Martin!
Thank you for your reply. I live in San Pedro, CA., nearby to SpaceX. We're soaking from all the rain here, but we need every drop."
7752,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Hi Martin! You're probably correct that there is no 'Antenna Engineering' degree. But if you scour university websites you can probably find a school with that title. Mostly it's a matter of semantics.  I know near to nothing about antenna engineering,  so it's a moot point for me. For many years I subscribed to a magazine called Wireless Design and Development (WD&D), which is kind of the trade magazine for wireless technology. Exciting stuff, but it's so specialized, and just doesn't excite me as much as basic computer science and IT work. However, wireless technology is becoming more and more pervasive every day. So, I salute anyone working in that field. Finally, as in the video,  nice to see wireless technology being used in the civilian sector, not just in military applications. üòÄ"
7753,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 Fair enough.
well mate, i've never attended Uni in the states,  I'm in Australia , Sydney
I've spoken to people in europe, U.S.A. India, Africa and U.K.   Never heard anyone mention the degree Antenna Engineer
it's also Telecommunication Engineer or E.E. or RF Applications or Wireless Application or something like that,  The Antenna part of it is a given,  if someone were an Antenna Engineer here in australia, they would have only 1 job..  To build Antenna's
so maybe this is a U.S. thing
but yeah , to me it's really fucking weird that i've never heard that before

we all accept that Engineering courses are like    Electrical and Electronics or  computer Science or things like that,  and.. they are universal Titles for the most part,  aren't they ?"
7754,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 
Hold on.. So.. You're NOT an engineer ? (i assumed you were)
yeah.. Uni courses are generally universally named because they are recognized worldwide. you have coutries where certain additional courses are needed but the CORE subjects are recognized and an engineer is respected worldwide as ""An Engineer""  regardless o the discipline they undertook
in Australia an Antenna related course would be Telecommunications Engineering, you would start with Electrical and Electronics CORE Subjects then Minor in Telecommunications and a sub branch may be R.F. Applications, if that tickled your fancy

i don't think it's semantics ,  i think it's how they universally name it 
i mean take this...   i did BENGH (it means Bachelor degree in ENGineering - Honours)
so you had the lower counterpart BENG (Same course, but the H is higher recognized and harder passing criteria,  Truth be told,  i only picked the Honours course because BENG was full  :P) And now that i have it i sound like something from men in black.............""With Honours""............""sir""    LOL

but the point is,  you then go to europe, they have the same thing, you go to USA they have the exact same course name, i believe M.I.T. carries the same course name
so i don't think it's semantics
To be just an Antenna engineer is a sub topic to the whole thing and to do it you need a degree in Electronics and Electrical and then Minor in Telecommunications
THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME AN ANTENNA ENGINEER which is why my original comment said what it said....  it's weird the way it's stated 
it's like if someone was an electrician,    it's called  CERTIFICATE 3 IN ELECTRO TECHNOLOGY 
you do a certain amount of time in the industry and a person refers you and you then apply to the licensing board for a licence for  CERTIFIED ELECTRICIAN

but even though electricians deal with , let's say  RELAYS,  you don't have a RELAY TECHNICIAN or RELAY ELECTRICIAN,  that's covered in Cert 3 in Electro Technology

"" For many years I subscribed to a magazine called Wireless Design and Development (WD&D)""
LOL.. yeah i know it

"" and just doesn't excite me as much as basic computer science and IT work. ""
Sure, i get that,  i'm also an I.T. Engineer
and since you're an I.T. Guy,  i can then tell you this , As i'm the following

- I.T. Guy
- Telecommunications Guy
- Being Repairing electronics since i was 6  guy (i'm 49)
- TV Antenna and Satellite guy
- CCTV and Security Guy
- NBN and Internet Infrastructure Guy
- Wireless computer Guy
- Wireless RF Guy

that being said
it is one thing to be talking about Wireless Transmission in I.T. Networks and the mentality that systems admin's have
it's a completely different kettle of fish when you're talking Wireless Transmission to a HAM Operator or even to an R.F. Guy

Just like it's a completely different kettle of fish to talk to an I.T. Guy about Ethernet cable and then phone lines,  but then... Talk to a Telecom's Linesman about Phone lines and the I.T. system Admin is lost in the topic, but then you talk to a Linesman about let's say OSI Model and Encapsulation and he is also lost

being on the I.T. Side of the fence of Wireless is a completely different ball game to being on the R.F. side of Wireless..  The R.F. side is definitely the better side to be on in this respect, But ask an I.T. Guy 
- What is the formula for wavelength
- What is a half wave Dipole
- How do you construct an antenna for a certain set of frequencies

i promise you they won't know, but for an R.F Engineer, this is 1+1


""So, I salute anyone working in that field.""
thank you, and i salute you for your interest in the field as well and determination.
Feel free to ask any questions if you like

but yeah, that's my take on the whole thing"
7755,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Yes, mate. Great observations."
7756,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Thank you for your long-winded explanation, Martin. It all makes perfect sense.

You've probably hear the riddle ""how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?"" Hehehe ü§™. 

Originally I studied to be an EE, but the physics courses looked quite grueling (thermodynamics, gravity, etc.). My interests were more into software and computer systems, so I earned a BSCS from Cal State Northridge. It isn't known for much internationally,  except that there was a big earthquake there exactly 29 years ago today (01/17/1994), one year after graduating. Most jobs I've held didn't fully take advantage of the school curriculum,  but it at least provided the credentials needed in order to at least meet an employer's requirements. These days companies are looking more for practical knowledge (like Elon Musk demands), so we can thank YouTube for getting up to speed with technical learning!

The school did have an antenna üì° laboratory, but as you mentioned I believe it fell under various ""EE"" majors, and no degrees for 'antenna engineering.'

In the 80s I worked for several computer companies that made disk drives, communication equipment, etc. However, by 1985 most of the hardware jobs were moving to Asia and Mexico. Plus, many foreign students were becoming EE's because they were good in math and physics.  They weren't good in English, so software was still an open field (this was before the Internet and offshoring became of age). 

Anyway, it looks like you also had a long and exciting career in the computer field, Martin.

A college buddy of mine moved to Sydney in the 1990s. He did very well as an IT worker, and enjoyed living on the 'Gold Coast.' He was a woman chaser,  but if I had a chance to visit your city, just going to the Sydney Opera House and climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge would be a thrill!

Well, enjoy your evening, Martin, and Happy New Year!"
7757,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 
Actually 
1. sorry for the long reply
2. No i actually haven't heard that joke,  I'm a hardware guy myself, Ironically i changed 7 light bulbs yesterday all by myself :P

3"" My interests were more into software and computer systems,""
ahhh.. so you don't know how to change a light bulb......... GOT IT !!   LOL

4 ""so I earned a BSCS from Cal State Northridge. It isn't known for much internationally,""
As did i , I attended RMIT which is (as far as prestige is concerned) #1 in Australia, Approx 16th in the world
Now... In my humble opinion, that doesn't mean JACK SHIT !!!

5. "" Most jobs I've held didn't fully take advantage of the school curriculum,  but it at least provided the credentials needed in order to at least meet an employer's requirements.""
LMFAO... YEAH... 
by the time i attended i had already been running a business for several years, in all honesty .. so let me preface something first to avoid confusion
Here in Australia  we have TAFE (Government Funded College), Private College's and University

Our University is your college
i don't know what you call TAFE in the states, but for us , College is what you do after high school but before Uni and Uni is not a necessity, neither is college for that matter but it's highly advised

so...  i attended every course under the sun in TAFE it got fucking boring so i went to Uni out of a desire to learn more, it had nothing to do with getting a job , for me
but yeah, that's what i heard mate, from the young one's
""Why are you here""..............  ""To get a good job"" 
LMFAO
this was the usual response.

""These days companies are looking more for practical knowledge (like Elon Musk demands), so we can thank YouTube for getting up to speed with technical learning!""
I Agree,  and i think there is nothing better than practical knowledge, Although.. this is from a hardware standpoint, but i think it still stands true for coding, I've done my fair share

""The school did have an antenna üì° laboratory, but as you mentioned I believe it fell under various ""EE"" majors, and no degrees for 'antenna engineering.'""
that sounds correct

""In the 80s I worked for several computer companies that made disk drives""
LOL  awww fuck...  do tell
IBM, DEC, Winchester Storage ???
i remember my Verbatim , Double side, Double Density Disks,  but.. i was a young lad at the time

"" just going to the Sydney Opera House and climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge would be a thrill!""
LOL.... mate, you're such a fucking tourist  LOL
No.. but if you're ever in the area, Message me, i'll show you around 
Going to Opera house is a given, you probably won't see opera, you'll probably have a drink at the bar,   botanical gardens are another tourist thingy and then you have to do the following to get your initiation down pat

Bridge climb
bondi Beach
Kings Cross Night life
Revolving Restaurant at Centrepoint (sydney Tower)
Circular quay boat ride to somewhere
Taronga Zoo
Queen Victoria building walk
Centennial Park

After you do that and separate yourself form the asians with camera's and the english backpackers WE CAN THEN DO SOME REAL SHIT

as for your mate in the 90s,  yeah around that time there was an I.T. Company boom, a mate of mine was also part of it, it got to a point where no one knew which company was which and when you asked someone ""which company do you work for"" the response would be ""Oh.. one of these big I.T. companies""   (no one cared to name them anymore)

Enjoy your evening mate as well
if you're ever in sydney , let me know, we'll catch up if you like, i'll show you around and make sure no one fucks you over and you get good accomodation
be cool"

ok,,  
1. there are also job titles called  HELPDESK ENGINEER  (and yet they don't build desks)

2. Programmer is COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE  it's not Program engineering

4. i don't think a job should include someone's degree title, these are not my rules, 
I'm just saying there is no degree course that is called Antenna Engineering.
as for jobs, well, Employers can call the job title whatever they want
Antenna engineer
Aerial Fixer guy

however courses are regulated and there is a standard to the naming of engineering courses, that's what i'm referring to"
7760,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Hello Martin!

Thank you for all your replies and comments, Martin! Greatly appreciated.  I've been getting busier these days, so can't spend too much time trolling around on YouTube.  However, thank you again for your comments. Just a few observations:

* How many computer programmers does it take to change a light bulb?üí° 

A: none - it's a hardware problem. (probably the first computer riddle, if not the lamest one).

* Disk drive companies:

In the late 1970s an IBM engineer named Sirjang L. Tandon devised a way to place a read/write head on the opposite side of a floppy üíæ disk, creating the double-sided disk drive. His superiors told him to put the drive on a shelf where it collected dust. As a result, he left IBM and started his own company, Tandon Magnetics, which I worked for after high school. This spawned a dozen disk drive companies in the northwest corner of Los Angeles, where I eventually worked for half of them. Of course, when Seagate Technology began producing 5¬º-inch hard disc drives, these floppy firms also jumped in. Most of these companies are now defunct, although Tandon's claim to fame was providing the initial floppy disk drives for the IBM PC, which debuted in 1981. From 1984 I then worked at a company called Micom systems, which produced high-speed modems, multiplexers and APBX equipment. So, Southern California did have and still has a vibrant electronics industry, although much of it has been offshored to countries with cheaper labor and less environmental regulations. I'm sure the same trend happened in Australia üá¶üá∫ as well. 

* Yep  my college buddy was part of that 90s IT boom on the Gold Coast... he raved about Bondi Beach ‚õ±  and all that stuff. Haven't heard from him since, though... maybe a shark got him. 

Well, that's about it, mate!

7797,qs2QcycggWU,Are there sidelobes if the antennas are smaller than the wavelength? Because in that case it should behave as one single emitter and the beam would behave according to diffraction.
7798,qs2QcycggWU,very informative video...
7799,qs2QcycggWU,"Really cool explaination, now i know how i have internet on planes! Great video."
7800,qs2QcycggWU,"14:48 The intensity should be 4.5 million times higher, right? Because the power is 3'500 times higher but the beam is 1280 times tighter.
When you put two antennas together the amplitude is 2 times higher but the intensity is the amplitude square so 4 times higher."
7801,qs2QcycggWU,What do you mean by changing the phase (and amplitude) to send data? doesn't changing the phase change the direction at which we're pointing to the satellite?
7802,qs2QcycggWU,Not if all the antennas change phase the same way.
7803,qs2QcycggWU,"@@johntheux9238 Even if all the antennas do it, because of phase change, the direction will change and we'll no longer be pointing at the satellite directly, correct?"
7804,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BennyJosephPerepogu No, changing the phase means emitting the signal a bit sooner or later but it's exactly the same beam. To change the direction of the beam you need to emitt the signal at a different time from different antennas so that they cross at a different point in space."
7805,qs2QcycggWU,The beam direction is governed by the phase DIFFERENCES between all the elements. Any phase difference added equally to ALL the elements doesn't change that.

With the same use of beamforming + steering and wireless charging. I can imagine maybe a room wide area which locates the phone and directs charge to it. Although the conversion would be low considering the inverse square law."
7815,qs2QcycggWU,Not if the beam is very tight.
7816,qs2QcycggWU,Most wireless charging systems I've seen work more like a transformer than an antenna.

7818,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!!
7819,qs2QcycggWU,"Question: changing the direction of the beam uses phase shifting, but sending data also uses phase shifting, does that cause problems with beam direction?"

7847,qs2QcycggWU,If you do the same dive into Hardware and Software it will be just awesome. But still never the less this is the best quality video about RF transmitting I even saw.
7848,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, Thank you for this Video!"
7849,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video. Complex topic made not simple, but as simple as possible. You guys make understandable vids. Thanks. And gotta note and appreciate Elon musk and spaceX."
7850,qs2QcycggWU,"insanely amazing video! By the way, how are these animations made?"
7851,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is gold, so informative. please make more"
7852,qs2QcycggWU,"Unbelievable great video.  I am a computer engineering student and no normal Educational institution that i know can claim to inspire student and explain complicated topics at the same time as you guys. For my taste its the perfect mix between abstraction to let you understand the technology at a big scale and explaining the concepts behind this like phase shift. 

Well done keep going!"
7853,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. Thanks for investing so much time to create such a masterpiece! I learned a lot and am amazed by how complex this technology is we use everyday.
7854,qs2QcycggWU,today I understand the necessity of research and development.
7855,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video as usual! I am thinking, if they use phase shifting to steer the beam and phase shifting to do the QAM64, how these two work together? The data sent is more or less random, how it can me combined with the phase shift for the steering?"
7856,qs2QcycggWU,"Easy, the first one use phase shifting between antennas, the other shift all the antennas the same way."
7857,qs2QcycggWU,Truly amazing video. The dept of explanation is awesome. Thank you!
7858,qs2QcycggWU,Very good video I like
7859,qs2QcycggWU,"This is wonderful! Thank you guys, you are keeping the quality and format on very high level. It's always a pleasure to see one of those, even if it takes a lot of time to prepare!"
7860,qs2QcycggWU,"DOUBT: around 6:40, you say that the feed line (the trace coming from the Microcontroller) wirelessly transmits the sin wave thing to the copper circle.. But wouldn't that happen with a 50-60Hz AC signal as well? Why do we need a 12GHz signal here? 
Or is it such that the 50-60Hz AC signal won't be able to create a EM radiation?"
7861,qs2QcycggWU,"You need a high frequency in order to be able to modulate the signal with a high data rate.  Also, viable antennas at only 50-60 Hz would be about 750 miles across (for a quarter wavelength antenna) and probably not fit in your back yard."
7862,qs2QcycggWU,"At the lower frequency there isn't much voltage difference over the length of the microstrip and patch, hence there isn't a significant electrical field generated between each side of the patch. All to do with the time it takes for the voltage to travel through the conductor (at near speed of light)."
7863,qs2QcycggWU,@@scienteer3562 Is there a relation with frequency of signals and amount of voltage induced in the other plate (conductor)?
7864,qs2QcycggWU,"@@AtAGlimpse_UB yes, but probably not how you imagine."
7865,qs2QcycggWU,"üòÆüòÆAwesome,Very Good Sir,Keep It Up.üòÆüòÆ"
7866,qs2QcycggWU,"Branch education:  watch at 1.25x speed.
Me: my dumbass mind putting it in 0.5x to get it"
7867,qs2QcycggWU,"We need more such videos
And you need to be appreciated for your hard work, i can see that amount of work you have to do for animations and researchü´°"
7868,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best YouTube channel ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
7869,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing! Good job, keep going like this!"
7870,qs2QcycggWU,Epic educational video.
7871,qs2QcycggWU,I hope starlink can work on smartphones someday.
7872,qs2QcycggWU,Top notch quality video üôÉ
7873,qs2QcycggWU,"Is the doppler effect due to the satellites moving towards & away from dishy at high speeds negligible here? Hmm, I guess I can do the math myself. 
(Velocity of satellite)/(2*antenna size) -> (7.7km/s)/(2*1.15 cm) -> 334 kHz = about 0.3 MHz = about 0.0003 GHz
This means that when the satellite moves towards dishy, the satellite will see at most 13.0003 GHz and when the satellite is moving away it will be at least 12.9997 GHz.
Yes, the doppler effect is negligible."
7874,qs2QcycggWU,"What a great video!!!
Thamk you for this opportunity to know about this amazing technology üëè"
7875,qs2QcycggWU,I found 25
7876,qs2QcycggWU,25
7877,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible!! This channel NEEDS millions of subs!!
7878,qs2QcycggWU,Can you please pin link for 45min log video
7879,qs2QcycggWU,"This is amazing, we dont appreciate the technology we have in hand until we pop up the hood and look underneath. And this channel does exactly that + mind = BLOWN ;)"
7880,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful video! Thought out and well presented.
7881,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe I'm watching this free.
7882,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate this channel SO much. I wish any other science media had the guts to cover technology that is actually relevant and modern in such an understandable way. Huge props for the incredible work going into this. A broke engineering student thanks you!
7883,qs2QcycggWU,I can relate bud
7884,qs2QcycggWU,How the hell does man come up with this stuff! Very cool indeed. Love stuff like this. My dad was always into electronics. Heathkits back in the day. Also a ham operator. Then got an Apple][ computer. I myself ended up working in the IT field for over 20 years.
7885,qs2QcycggWU,I've never had another YouTuber recommend watching at something besides 1x playback speed. These guys really know their audience.
7886,qs2QcycggWU,I will not bore you with your excellence. üíå
7887,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing üòÄ
I just revised all concepts of my grad school ü§£ in just 28 min."
7888,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow. I had no idea it was so complex. I remember the old satellite internet systems, how slow they were and you still needed to have a dial up internet to upload data. What a masterpiece of technology Elon Musk has built. Thank you for explaining it so eloquently Branch Education! Liked, subscribed and commented :)"
7889,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  We appreciate it!
7890,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this on my Starlink internet.  Perfect!
7891,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. if you‚Äôre looking for a constructive comment, perhaps you could add some resources from credible journals too. Once again, amazing video!"
7892,qs2QcycggWU,So excellent! I have been wanting to see a video about Starlink like this for so long! <3
7893,qs2QcycggWU,"Do the satellites send signals between themselves? If so then how because the 4 dishes on each satellite highlighted in the video don't seem to be able to do so. Also, is each satellite rotating while in orbit in order to always face towards the ground?"
7894,qs2QcycggWU,Wooow
7895,qs2QcycggWU,You all 100% deserve my subscribion. Oml this was so detailed amazing job! This needs more views which I sure will happen!
7896,qs2QcycggWU,"You are my favorite channel right now, I love it"
7897,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is revolutionary, bringing modern internet speeds to rural and remote areas. 
It's not as fast or reliable as fiber optic line,  but is the last step to bringing decent internet to most humans wherever they are."
7898,qs2QcycggWU,This is brilliant!
7899,qs2QcycggWU,"The love, effort and thought put into these videos are just as mind-blowing as the technology itself!"
7900,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!   We appreciate it.
7901,qs2QcycggWU,we need more of this on the internet!
7902,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink makes everything easy being the only advanced technology for the whole world to make everything easy.
7903,qs2QcycggWU,This information is truly priceless! Thank you for sharing!
7904,qs2QcycggWU,"this channel is awesome, keep it up <3"
7905,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, whoever invented this stuff is smarter than I."
7906,qs2QcycggWU,"He branch education make a video on binary codes how computer lagaungee made and how codes upgrade with time and working mchanism full ,love ur videos"
7907,qs2QcycggWU,By far my only subscription and notification channel in youtube
7908,qs2QcycggWU,So deep
7909,qs2QcycggWU,great video!!
7910,qs2QcycggWU,Woah thats awesome engineering Marvel. Hays off for the enginner's who work on this type of things.
7911,qs2QcycggWU,"18:38 / Could i know why can‚Äôt we see differences in phase shifted visible light?
Visible light and micro wave is same electromagnatic wave so i think it should work same way through phased array LED"
7912,qs2QcycggWU,That's way more in-depth than I though it would be. Amazing!
7913,qs2QcycggWU,Probably the best engineering educational content on YouTube. Amazing
7914,qs2QcycggWU,"I will watch it tomorrow, with an open mind, now gonna sleep."
7915,qs2QcycggWU,I am glad you didn't use 'freedom' units. Metric is the best.
7916,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing work you have done here to make me understand the principle of this awesome technology! Thank you all so very much! Love your content!!!
7917,qs2QcycggWU,Shout out to Dishy Mcflatface.
7918,qs2QcycggWU,How does the satellite communicate with multiple dishes?
7919,qs2QcycggWU,"great video! It's so much easier to learn with animations, thanks so much"
7920,qs2QcycggWU,"Love your work, so good"
7921,qs2QcycggWU,"Just wondering, how does phase shifting during signal transfer not affect the dish‚Äôs area of constructive interference?"
7922,qs2QcycggWU,I greatly appreciate the TO SCALE models!
7923,qs2QcycggWU,"I greatly appreciate videos like these! Subscribed, liked, commented, and hit the bell button!"
7924,qs2QcycggWU,"Your videos are so good! If I may give a tip from a dumb user's perspective... I suspect your thumbnails could use some work. I keep on missing them in my subscription feed. Not sure why, maybe they're too cluttered or something. Just an idea, I'd love to see your channel grow as much as possible!!"
7925,qs2QcycggWU,Just wow of both the technology and the explaination.
7926,qs2QcycggWU,Love it üôÇüëç
7927,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7928,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is impressive.
7929,qs2QcycggWU,wow
7930,qs2QcycggWU,This makes me moist
7931,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, but Starlink is crap, space junk, it has a small lifespan and their internet service is too expensive"
7932,qs2QcycggWU,I am using Dishy Mcflatface and I am still having lag...
7933,qs2QcycggWU,I love this channel so much
7934,qs2QcycggWU,Keep up the good work with this channel!
7935,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! This is incredible in two way. Number one,  the level of detail in the video. Number two the complexity of satellite internet. That you for making this!"
7936,qs2QcycggWU,Really interesting.. like it keep on going
7937,qs2QcycggWU,"Ubiquitous, but anisotropic in the presence of a mass body, the Aether shall set us free. Just rotate the Michelson-Morley Interferometer vertically to find out. üòâ"
7938,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for a great video.
7939,qs2QcycggWU,This is real mind blowing how am seeing the physics and math I did some years ago applies in advanced tech
7940,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video ... Great job
7941,qs2QcycggWU,"I don't think there can be a better YouTube channel than this
And yes this is the first time I've commented something like this"
7942,qs2QcycggWU,The video would have been better without all of the Musk-isms.
7943,qs2QcycggWU,Huh??
7944,qs2QcycggWU,You managed to explain hard topics  in a very visual and easy to understand way! Thank you
7945,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome detailing on this subject.
7946,qs2QcycggWU,"Loved the great details in this video, all of your videos are great.  This is one of my favorites so far.  I would watch then every day if you could put them out that quick, but I understand it takes a ton of research and work to get one video done.  Keep up the great work!"
7947,qs2QcycggWU,Glad you enjoyed it!  Also thanks for being a supporter and sticking with us!
7948,qs2QcycggWU,I would easily watch a 45 minutes video so well made and interesting. Thanks for the awesome content you publish!
7949,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant explanation!
7950,qs2QcycggWU,Really great visual!! People dream of internet everywhere for a long time.
7951,qs2QcycggWU,Wow....great video. Never looked into the antenna besides the few with cats laying within them
7952,qs2QcycggWU,Really wish I had these videos when I was still in school. Just amazing quality all around.
7953,qs2QcycggWU,Perfect beautiful video ! So good explanation
7954,qs2QcycggWU,mans content here is about to bankrupt universities
7955,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video man, I really appreciate your hard work"
7956,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing video
7957,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely incredible educational content. Please keep doing more! There's nothing like this on youtube.
7958,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!  We appreciate it!
7959,qs2QcycggWU,I spotted 12 shooting stars üî≠ü§©
7960,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video as always! :)
7961,qs2QcycggWU,"After all, I've always wondered how beamforming actually works! Great explanation! I was often confused by 64 QAM, but your explanation immediately makes it clear how it works (at least on a broad scale). I really appreciate the videos, keep up the good work!"
7962,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  Glad to help you understand these topics.
7963,qs2QcycggWU,"Best video so far, amazing! On sidenote, I wouldn't have minded a 45 min version ;)"
7964,qs2QcycggWU,"I really appreciate your hard work, thank you so much üôè"
7965,qs2QcycggWU,24 stars seen; want to work with Branch Education in future videos
7966,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this informative video.  The way of your presentation was fabulous.
7967,qs2QcycggWU,mindblowing indeed üòÆ
7968,qs2QcycggWU,I have been watching since the third video you posted and it is amazing how each video improves on the last through format changes. Entertaining and educational is a hard thing to do and this channel excels at it.
7969,qs2QcycggWU,Care to make a sequel explaining how the satellites handoff connections to the ground antenna?
7970,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, i hope it gets viral and get tons of views"
7971,qs2QcycggWU,I was mindblown to the level of explanation done to this very complex topic that everyone could understand
7972,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video! You made a complex subject understandable.  Thank you and please make more.
7973,qs2QcycggWU,I really really appreciate for the high quality video.
7974,qs2QcycggWU,"1:34 Life Hack: Just watch the Video one time at 3x Speed, no problem :)"
7975,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic Video keep up the good work
7976,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow!!! Interference to form an beam, this is genius! Engineering rock!"
7977,qs2QcycggWU,Impeccable content. I wish they taught us the same way in university
7978,qs2QcycggWU,"Anyone wishing to see Starlink Dish from the inside : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmdQnIlnRo

7979,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video as always!
Q : can we expect 4K videos anytime soon on the channel?

Edit : Okay I just watched 22:00 I think 1080p is fine and goodüòÖ"
7980,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah-  I think we can get to 4k soon.  It just adds a lot of extra rendering time- but once we get to be a larger channel, we'll 100% switch all our videos to 4k."
7981,qs2QcycggWU,"You know they put more value on what people learn than how much money the video makes, when they recommend watching it at 1.25 or 1.5 speed, knowing that youtube will consider the video as having less watch time when people watch it at increased speed. I love when a channel values my time."
7982,qs2QcycggWU,"I had to laugh when it was recommended to play faster than normal speed. I have post surgery cognition issues and my brain is fogged up a lot from the pain meds,, so I've been playing all my YouTube videos and movies at 0.75 or three quarters speed just to be able to follow and understand the storylines and presentations."
7983,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video thanks.
7984,qs2QcycggWU,"Please keep creating such quality videos.

Also I wished you would have shown how data is transferred in an area with a lot of dishy communicating to a single Starlink satellite. Maybe in a future video."
7985,qs2QcycggWU,"This is up there with kurzgesagt in terms of quality, but the channel has less than a million subscribers??! Good job and thank you for this awesome educational content.

Question: what is an in-depth answer for why people are getting less internet speed now that there are more people using starlink?"
7986,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video please keep ¬¥em comin¬¥ üòçüôè
7987,qs2QcycggWU,It was a perfect gift to my brain cells. Thank you!
7988,qs2QcycggWU,"If my math teacher would have showed me this video 15 years ago I would have understood why math is useful in life. How all those apparently boring formulas are applied to technologies, why we need to understand them in order to benefit from technologies that now we give for granted but actually aren't."
7989,qs2QcycggWU,Now this is what YouTube was made for
7990,qs2QcycggWU,"Probably it's way more complicated than highschool physics but I'll ask anyways.

8:58 Current is flowing to the left so shouldn't the yellow magnetic field using the right hand rule be pointing towards us?
Amazing video btw."
7991,qs2QcycggWU,I saw 24 shooting stars
7992,qs2QcycggWU,"This should be curriculum material, like actually shown in schools."
7993,qs2QcycggWU,"Thats, the goal.  To supplement curricula with in depth real world tech"
7994,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video!
7995,qs2QcycggWU,this is insane
7996,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, I would love watch it with quality 4k or at least 1440p.
Quality Content like this looks better with also hi-q of image :)"
7997,qs2QcycggWU,For real the best channel for explanations

8009,qs2QcycggWU,Wuhh! Jerry is hear üôÇüôè
8010,qs2QcycggWU,"Thats only part of it. Took someone with some bold vision. There is a reason why no one really has created a LEO system like this. The sats fall out of orbit every 4-5 years. Takes massive capital to start, massive capital to maintain all inherently linked to massive subscriber base. The window for this to succeed is small. I love it. Has changed how I work and RV."

8044,qs2QcycggWU,This is high school level physics. Good students know that.
8045,qs2QcycggWU,ayo when we getting a durability test on the starlink?
8046,qs2QcycggWU,Jerry wants to check the durability of starlink satalite
8047,qs2QcycggWU,When will you do a durability test for dishy? I would like to see if it will makes a deeper grooves on the scratch test
8048,qs2QcycggWU,So easy to fool the generations after 2000. You show them some cartoons and they believe it. No critical thinking at all.
8049,qs2QcycggWU,"Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once againüòÅ solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
8050,qs2QcycggWU,"If earth and atmosphere spin 1600 KMph in the eastward direction, then flights traveling west at max speed 1000 KMph, must be having hard time to cruise and would never reach its westward destination. But in real life scenario, flights reach the destinations between A and B at the same duration regardless of the direction. This one fact alone is enough to prove that the earth is NOT a spinning ball, but rather a flat disk.. Globe model is illuminati deception, and it's been busted.. checkmate.."
8051,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellites don't exist. GPS not working in ocean. GPS is just the triangulation of cell towers. Internet cables are buried under the ocean. Time to wake up. Trust your senses..
_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth. There is a treaty signed by 50 countries that no man can get to Antarctica, because it's the surrounding wall of our flat earth, and it extends very far."
8052,qs2QcycggWU,"No curvature evidence, no spinning evidence, no Antarctica circumnavigation, releasing fake cgi images, yet they are yelling that we are traveling on a stupid ball with high pressure air rubbing against vacuum. What a pathetic bunch of losers. Their cognitive dissonance won't let them realize that earth is flat and non-moving.
_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic. Shame on those who believe globe earth nonsense, globers keep whining but still they don't have a single proof that earth is flying, spinning, or having curvature. 2022 is the year of waking up."

8236,qs2QcycggWU,"Finally, I have always wondered how beamforming actually works! Great explanation! 64 QAM was new to me but your explanation made it instantly clear how it works (at least at a broad level). I really appreciate these videos, keep them coming!"
8237,qs2QcycggWU,"there are many many different modulation methods, shorter range radios can encode 8 bits at a time. the more bits you encode the more data you can pack into it, however the more susceptible it is to interference and errors. the whole point of digital over analog was precisely because it was much more resilient to errors in transmission.
in this constant chase of faster data rates, digital is becoming less and less digital but more and more analog."
8238,qs2QcycggWU,"Current mobile devices and WiFi Access points are capable of 1024 QAM.. Starlink is behind current telecommunication protocols.. as of today is just a ""for show"" system."
8239,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium calling starlink a ""for show system"" in the basis that the modulation uses less bits than bleeding edge wifi is ignorant. as explained in my comment, more dense modulation comes at the cost of higher error rate. it works fine for shorter ranges with low interference, but you're not going to make it work well beaming the signal from orbit using frequencies over 10 GHz."
8240,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Oh don't get confused.. it is a for show system based on the premise that the requirements of abundant ground stations renders the low orbit infraestructura useless..
The quadrature amplitude modulation example was addressed to the person at the original comment.. which seems to have just discovered its workings."
8241,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium the point is not ""abundant ground stations"", which only matters for regional areas, it doesn't impact stations in the other side of the continent.
the point of starlink is to provide usable internet anywhere in the world. it's not meant to replace optic fiber, which is what you seem to be assuming.
other than satellite, you're just not going to get internet at a feasible cost any other way to a remote island, for example."
8242,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr No.. Im assuming you haven't noticed a wireless system which requires also a lot of ground stations without the need for recurrent space missions.
8243,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium i do in fact work at an ISP and we use radio towers.
i think i'd know first hand the limitations of these.
good luck getting to a very remote rural area this way. if the area doesn't have high enough demand to justify all the radio repeaters, they either have no internet at all or use a geostationary satellite. starlink is a massive step-up from that."
8244,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You are mixing the benefits of geostationary with low orbit and ironically omitting the drawbacks.
8245,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium a low orbit constellation is obviously a lot more expensive to maintain, but they're doing it. i don;'t know what more proof of concept you need. didn't he say in this video they already have 500k customers? do the math."
8246,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr So if you read carefully you are going to notice within my comments how I attribute the success of the company to their reliance on people NOT knowing a thing about technology.
8247,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr Or do you really think Starlink could have financed the project if they told everyone that for it to work as promised they need to discard 90% of the satellites?
8248,qs2QcycggWU,@@absolutium discard 90% of the satellites? what are you even talking about?
8249,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You didn't knew? Well look at it..
8250,qs2QcycggWU,@@absolutium how about you just explain instead?
8251,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Well if you ask any person how Starlink works most people assume (dont know why) that the data is comming from space and that they are communicating to other parts of the world without ""touching"" the earth until the data's destination is reached..."
8252,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr You and I know that is B.S.. 
What people also don't know is that the satellite array has a laughable lifespan (arguably by choice) which will require that the vast majority of the device in orbit gets replaced.."
8253,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr So the array in place is a test.. Yet at a cost of half a million dollar per satellite and 15 million per launch.. do you really think that Starlink is the cost effective solution (for rural areas) when all that (unnecessary) work has to be destroyed for it to be compliant with the original promises and expectations?
8254,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium how is that relevant, at all?
first of all, the end consumer couldn't care less if the company they're buying services from is profitable or if it does things differently than what they imagine.
at the end of the day consumers only really care about 2 things:
1) is it cheaper than alternatives?
2) does it work better than alternatives?
that's it. everything else is just trivia to them.

now, for your argument that it's just ""for show"" because the constellation has a small lifespan, what you're ultimately trying to say is that they can't turn a profit on it.
mind you, uber had never made profit until 2021. same with tesla.
these massive companies doing something nobody else is doing can take a decade of bleeding billions of dollars on expansion until they turn profit.
i wonder if 5 years ago you'd be saying the same about those companies."
8255,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You are missing the fact that an IPO is based on public perception.. what do you think would be the worlds consensus if they noticed the Eco-minded guy just wasted not only billions of dollars from subsidies investors and consumers into a project he knows won't work as is.. but that the outrageous carbon footprint was for nothing..
8256,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr It is for show as they did knew the thousands of satellites deployed weren't  capable of intercomunication among the nods.
8257,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr At a fraction of the energy toll LTE+ could have been easily deployed until they knew how to do wjat the promised.. why? Because ground stations were still deployed.
8258,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium please say what you have to say in a single comment...
anyway you keep making more and more outrageous claims and i'm not so free on time that i'd want to keep debunking so let's leave it at that."
8259,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr ..That's just an example with a team of 6 we managed to establish Metropolitan Area Network for a financial institution with around 40km wireless communications at over 200Mbps
Do you really think that a multi-billion dollar organization is uncapable of doing 50x better?"
8260,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium omnidirectional radio towers are in fact more expensive, use more pwoer and are slower than directional radio dishes.
again, i'd know, i work with both, we're an ISP. i have real expertise in this area, so you're really barking up the wrong tree here."
8261,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr The minute I pulled costs into the equation you went on a rant saying I keep bringing new topics.. but now you seem to think a single space trip is less expensive than any of both technologies I mentioned? 
So costs just happen according to your cable guy perception??
Also if you work deploying telecom infrastructure you know omnidirectional radio proyection within cellular network is mostly a combination of directional arrays."
8262,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium now you're just appealing to lying about things i said and didn't say.
good day sir. you're not only beyond reason, but willing to lie."
8263,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr Fortunatelly you can Read again the comments so you notice how your initial argument talked  cost... without even knowing what was the measure for comparison.
8264,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Yes - also to keep the latency down to 20 milliseconds, the satellites üõ∞ need to be closer to the ground. However, as mentioned in the video, an orbiting satellite constellation is much harder to manage than a single geostationary satellite. But with improvements in electronics, software and network technologies, the Starlink system is still in its infancy."
8265,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
8266,qs2QcycggWU,"3:50 why are you saying ""aloomemum"" when the element clearly is called ""Aluminium""? this feels really strange on this great channel...."
8267,qs2QcycggWU,Wow guys that is amazing.  I would have designed the system a lot different though.  I would have used green/blue lasers and a telescopic lense system with stepper motor tracking.  Might need 2 telescopes however so one could be transceiving while the other re-aligning / waiting for next sequential satilite orbit.  Not sure if lasers could penetrate cloud and rain - maybe that's why starlink uses high frequency radio transmission.
8268,qs2QcycggWU,"many, many things wrong with your method.
first, you cant do that due to regulations. doubt the governments of the world would allow you to beam back and forth hundreds of thousands of visible light lasers in the night sky.
also price matters. lasers aren't exactly cheap. i work with optic fibers and a simple 1gbps transceiver is not cheap, now imagine how many you'd need in a compact space to achieve a phased-array antenna.
also logistics and feasibility of launching thousands of telescopes to space and at everyone's homes...

also my dude, common sense humility......
no way you, a random nobody, would be able to come up in a few minutes with a better solution than dozens of some of the world's best engineers in their respective fields over several years......."
8269,qs2QcycggWU,"This is definitely an informative video.  And as they sa in the video, they spent the time researching and the topic and re-writing things as they went and tehn the video production time being like 2 months just for this video.

For us that know little about the 'science' of it this is a great video to get the main points. Though to think of the knowledge it takes to actually design these things is a matter of great appreciation for what humans can do with God's things :)"

8274,qs2QcycggWU,I do not understand any of this but I find it very interesting.
8275,qs2QcycggWU,"The fact that great educational content like this gets less views & financial support than mindless entertainment videos on youtube shows that the politicians don't do their job well. We need to tax mindless entertainment more and use that money to then subsidize educational content more. that way more people will be motivated to create educational content instead of mindless one and also the kids would get more educated, too! 
At the end of the day we humans all want to have fun but if we educate ourselves and invent cool technologies now then we will be able to have even more fun and also more time for fun activities in the future"
8276,qs2QcycggWU,"As soon as you mentioned phase shift, it immediately clicked to me how the steering would work. I was pretty proud of myself at the moment because I consider myself dumb. Thanks for all the effort and time spent on this great video."

8281,qs2QcycggWU,Is it sufficient to use one big antenna instead of 1280 antennas?
8282,qs2QcycggWU,The beam would be fixed. To track the satellites would require moving the dish at incredible speeds. The passed array onboard the satellites actually needs to hop the pointing between lots of ground stations which is even harder.

8289,qs2QcycggWU,"Small nitpicks - in the orbital animation at 2:50 TV satellites should be shown to be geostationary, orbiting above the same area as the earth rotates. This is important because it explains why TV dishes can point at a single point in the sky, while Starlink beams need to be electronically steered. Furthermore, while the earth is correctly shown as rotating counterclockwise from the north pole, both satellites are orbiting in the wrong direction, east to west, while nearly all satellites orbit west to east to take advantage of earth's velocity.

Overall though, very nice video that explains complex electronic and communications concepts."
8290,qs2QcycggWU,Thx for the added details
8291,qs2QcycggWU,"well starlink also needs to transmit signals, so not only the movement of the satellites is what requires it to be electronically steered (phase arrayed)"
8292,qs2QcycggWU,Yes the retrograde orbits love it! Doesn't look like many people noticed though don't see very many comments. I think somebody got too focused on explaining phased arrays and forgot about orbits
8293,qs2QcycggWU,"And you can transmit data with a traditionnal dish if you have a Block upconverter, like in a VSAT"
8294,qs2QcycggWU,I wouldn't say that's nitpicking- it's just plain wrong and misleading.  After I saw that I stopped watching.
8295,qs2QcycggWU,"Sorry bout that-  Yeah, I was too focused on the phased array part to have the orbits as accurate as possible.  But thanks for the heads up- definitely all future videos will have proper orbits.  I added these facts to the errata."
8296,qs2QcycggWU,@@christalbert722 Sheesh. I hope your joking. The research and effort put into this video is beyond comprehension. How about you put together a video of this caliber without making one mistake.
8297,qs2QcycggWU,"Can't you just say the viewpoint was looking south, not north, so the satellites actually were shown going west to east, @@BranchEducation?"
8298,qs2QcycggWU,"@@nerrad15 I disagree. Accuracy in an educational video is vitally important. For instance, my reaction to seeing fixed dishes presented as communicating with satellites that were clearly non- geostationary caused me to distrust ALL of the information presented in the video, and I stopped watching right there. There are numerous places to learn about Starlink, and I would much prefer to find a source that is trustworthy. Production value is a plus, but accuracy is paramount."
8299,qs2QcycggWU,@@matthewfrost3677I noticed it right from the start. I worked with satellite communications over 30 years including 6 years at a gateway earth station with 15 meter satellite antennas.
8300,qs2QcycggWU,@@ZoulousProductionsThe latency is horrible. I worked with Ethernet on geostationary satellites and the round trip time was over 600 milliseconds.
8301,qs2QcycggWU,@@Chris_at_Home yes it can be up to 1 seconde
8302,qs2QcycggWU,"Always Love your content ‚ù§Ô∏è, it is very informative like a course. But I have one question, why the speed is not same for sending and receiving data? Also when we make the phase shift for a binary code, is the beam changes its direction because it is told earlier that by phase shifting the signal we can change the direction of the beam."
8303,qs2QcycggWU,"it is explained in the videos that the antennas can either receive or send at any given time, but not simultaneously.
what is not explained (since i imagine it would be intuitive) is that home users in practice use way more download than upload, since you're almost always just consuming content rather than creating. unless you're a content creator uploading your stuff to the internet, 90%+ of your traffic is download.
so most of the time the antennas are spent receiving data and occasionally sending data."

8325,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is certainly one of the most amazing feats of engineering so far in the 21st century, but I wonder what the life expectancy of this satellites will be with so much space debris in orbit, as well as the ever present risk of a solar flare knocking part the satellite grid down in the future."
8326,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink's system is quite robust to that.   The low orbit ensures that any defunct satellites will passively deorbit within a few months to years, ensuring no buildup of debris.  This means they require fuel and have a limited lifespan.  Which means they need replacement constantly.  So a flare that knocks out many sattelites just means some additional replacements are necessary. 

It's a system with perpetual, ongoing, active maintenence. So adapting to scenarios that demand additional update or upkeep is fairly simple.

This sort of system relies on cheep launch costs, hence the need for starship to make it sustainable long-term."
8327,qs2QcycggWU,"i believe life expectancy for the sattelites at such a low orbit is about 5 years, since they quickly lose speed/altitude due to friction with the upper atmosphere.
i also believe solar storms aren't of much concern to the satellites due to how small they are compared to the electromagnetic waves of the storm, they affect mostly the electric grid because of how big the conductors (basically the whole grid) are."
8328,qs2QcycggWU,@@Xylos144 this sounds like a hell of environmental pollution just to play fortnite in the desert/woods? and how does this finance itself if most people live in metropolitan areas that have good internet alrdy anyway?

8429,qs2QcycggWU,"Don palsy hits and too soon. In brief, Elon could create a party line in text messages, using the LTC downlink in GPS satellites. Which is decoded and every handset built in the last decade. To create a worldwide party line of text messages that's broadcast. Where the uplink is enter is interception of the cell phone tower transmissions. Which come booming out of their antennas. So loud that they are readable far beyond low earth orbit where the starlinks are. So modify the next generation of starlinks to also listen to those frequencies, and then broadcast down the L2C frequency, using a coding that's not interfering. Granted some will complain but if it's not interfering. Just a slight increase in the noise floor. A basketball team, gribbling and passing the ball until every player has touched the ball at least once. Where the first text sender, is assured delivery everywhere once It sees its message in the L2C it receives. Neither latency or bandwidth guaranteed. Just assurance of delivering. Will support every social network application, as all were born on a text message fabric. And still have that code embedded for legacy support. The handset takes the message, stores it in its internal database. Where unique It passes it on up the text message stack to all users. Where the internal text message database will contain, weeks if not years of from,-tos in relative time order. With payloads in the clear for apps that need to be compatible. With their first instantiations a decade ago. Good news is, delivery is assured to The world's population and their handsets. Bad news, the police and government lose their ability to absolutely censor. Other than perhaps as mandated antivirus filtering services. Use by government to censor, and others to limit children or employees access to things they should not hear or see. The police and governments, need to suck it up, what they lose is more than made up for visibility of all from to in relative time, gumshoe work possible by all. Where privacy as always and discrimination rules have to be enforced by human systems like the courts. Or the family buys the bullets, of those who speak politically incorrectly. The only security at the from to level that exist is operational security. Use it or lose it. One reason For a CEO to step aside. Is he now knows how to compete with himself and As CEO it would be up pure conflict of interest to remain. And any spacefaring nation that has floated their own GPS system can do this, where making the freedom to speak the right to speak, matched with the right to hear. Is utterly destabilizing to dictatorships and autocrats of all kinds, countries and individuals."
8430,qs2QcycggWU,"And for those who would like to disrupt the party line of text messages visible worldwide by jamming those signals. Will disable all use of GPS and its utility. Dave for being an accurate clock. . applications requiring location, if they don't have  built-in inertial navigation system. Will lose any commercial value, and be a  into a safety hazard. Until they pull off to the side of the road and reorient themselves, relative to reading an actual map about the next upcoming turn. The other nice feature about a party line text message service, which some of the existing services already claimed to be. But they forget that a let's connect every but one to everything. Only works if everyone can hear. And only the receiver can choose what to block, or use the equivalent of an antivirus package that they trust to filter what they can hear. Granted many do not use an antivirus folter even turn it off on purpose. Granted, the government could make it illegal to not run the filter they provide."

8708,nt6DTzJJgxo,"@@yipribadi 
The thing about remote areas in underdeveloped countries, is that the inhabitants are typically farmers and are very poor.  A family of 2 adults and 3 children will do their best to survive on approximately $10/day.
People in underdeveloped countries like the Philippines, typically live in small huts, approximately 12 sqm, no windows, just curtains hanging to stop the rain, dirt floor, walls made of plywood, roof made of sheets of corrugated metal, structures resembling what people in developed countries would consider a tool shed.
If the inhabitants are lucky they will own a cell phone and a moped which you will see the parents and multiple children traveling together on.
Food for the whole family will be rice three times a day and just a few vegetables and practically no meat.
So I ask you, how are the farmers going to afford an internet service that costs one weeks wages every month for the monthly subscription, plus a down payment for the hardware equivalent to 3 months wages."

Best to let it go, it's not for you. The errors are innumerable. When you get to this point, you have to stop immediately! You should go magnet fishing. You film the depollution and the surprises which will always be present. You will need to be well informed about the dangers. It's still not as simple as you think.  Finding yourself with a finger in the middle of 2 magnets with a potential of 500 KG each is an example. Watch out for each other.
Have a great day and a great future."

9846,bfThiqDd9FA,I think 'love how' should be a new metaphor for acute observation.

9850,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this has nothing to do with what I searched
9851,bfThiqDd9FA,What did you search for?
9852,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the volume of dust displaced from the surface of the Moon is about 7 to 10 times the mass of the actual object that impacted, pand is effected like a cloud in earth gravity and atmosphere."
9853,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there was no shock wave
9854,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the guy that made this video has impressed everyone
9855,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the moon never complained, and a dust cloud did earthly things outside its atmosphere"
9856,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how one 43 second video suddenly makes everyone experts in gravity, physics and special effects"
9857,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how people think it takes an advanced degree to understand the basic effects of gravity, physics, and special effects."
9858,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't think you need a degree in astrophysics to understand that dust travelling at a few kilometers per second wouldn't just lose it's velocity and then dissolve in 2 seconds for no reason without atmosphere
9859,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Bogdan_Vader also the framerate of the dust cloud is 10fps... the framerate of the video is 30fps :D
9860,bfThiqDd9FA,some of we might be OGIST alums
9861,bfThiqDd9FA,... and moon phases
9862,bfThiqDd9FA,"No, people just aren't as ignorant as you are."

It looked big enough to have wiped out Texas completely. The Earth's Moon is much more than we realize it is though. It's our protector that recieves nor expects any thanks or praise.

At first, astronomers thought it might have belonged to Elon Musk's SpaceX firm, and then said it was Chinese - something China denies.

The effects of the impact on the Moon should have been minor.

The rocket stage would have dug out a small crater and created a plume of dust.

Scientists hope to get confirmation in the coming days, or weeks.

The rocket part was first sighted from Earth in March 2015. A Nasa-funded space survey in Arizona spotted it, but quickly lost interest when the object was shown not to be an asteroid.

The rocket part is what's known as ""space junk"" - hardware discarded from missions or satellites without enough fuel or energy to return to Earth.

Some pieces are closer to us, just above the Earth, but others, like this booster, are thousands of kilometres away in high orbit, far from the Earth's atmosphere.

The European Space Agency estimates there are now 36,500 pieces of space junk larger than 10cm.

No space programme or university formally tracks deep space junk. Monitoring space is expensive and the risks to humans from high-orbit debris are low.

So, it falls to a tiny handful of volunteer astronomers who spend their free time making calculations and estimating orbits. They fire emails and alerts back and forth, asking whoever is in the best location on the planet to spot an object in space.

Six weeks after the booster was first seen, Peter Birtwhistle, 63, was watching the skies for asteroids from his garden in Newbury, in the south of England.

His telescope picked up a tiny dot of light tracking across the sky. Calculations suggested it was part of a rocket, he told BBC News.

Space junk drops in and out of view, often unpredictably. For seven years, he barely saw the rocket part - until in January, it reappeared.

""I grabbed some images when it passed close to Earth,"" he explained.

He sent his pictures to astronomer and data scientist Bill Gray, on the east coast of the United States. He is the expert who went on to identify it as a SpaceX booster heading for the Moon.

News that a discarded part of one of billionaire Musk's space missions was going to strike the Moon made global headlines.

But tracking space junk is often ""detective work,"" Gray explains. The rocket insignia cannot be seen - astronomers have to piece together its identity by tracking its route backwards through space. They then match its orbit to dates and locations of rocket launches and trajectories.

But some space missions, including China's, don't publicise their routes.

""For a Chinese mission, we know the launch date because they are televised. So I take a guess that it's going to get to the Moon - usually in four or five days. Then I compute an approximate orbit,"" Gray explains.

And sometimes he makes mistakes. Weeks after the SpaceX identification, another observer sent Gray new data, revealing that his identification was impossible.

He ran the numbers again and concluded it was the third stage of a rocket from China's lunar mission Chang'e 5-T1, launched in October 2014.

China denied this, saying the upper-stage had re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up.

Gray is sticking to his prediction. He believes China has mixed up the tracking of two rocket parts. ""I'm 99.9% sure it's the China 5-T1,"" he says.

In reality, we will never be sure.

Prof Hugh Lewis, from University of Southampton, says the scientific value of tracking deep space junk is limited. But he says it's important to ""keep an eye on what's there"", especially as human settlement in space becomes more likely.

""It's the mess we've created. Objects that we think are safe can actually return to Earth unexpectedly,"" he says.

Wherever it came from, no-one will have witnessed the booster's last moments.

Evidence of what happened won't come until two satellites that orbit the Moon pass over the projected impact site and photograph the resulting crater feature.

And as the booster broke into thousands of pieces, much of the physical evidence of its true origins will be lost, too. The best we've got are the estimates made by Gray and the volunteer astronomers watching the skies.

But if the moon is the distance thay say it is then do you understand how big that plasma plum would be. You can't believe anything ever. Or at least don't believe in things that affect your or anyone else's life it's. Fine to have a belief that you may win the lottery one day and as long as it doesn't affect your life and others. But to believe someone can be possessed by devils or demonds is not a healthy or safe belief as it has and still is being seen yep

I usually double check my spelling, but I only just discovered Mr. Wallace had passed away, and I'm a little shook up - not that it's an excuse for not proof-reading a comment.

10776,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is very dark on its surface like dark asphalt.  It's lighter underneath so any plumb would look really bright compared with the moon.  You'd also see colour because it would result in super heated ejecta.  It would take hours to look that size.  Still, that would look boring this is far better and what is use in a film."

1 John 5:13 KJV 
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Romans 1:16-17 KJV
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. (Anyone who believes). 

2 Corinthians 11:3 KJV
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

1 John 3:19-24 KJV
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

All have, currently and will continue to sin in this flesh, it is impossible for any man on the earth to stop sinning, we need a saviour, Jesus Paid for my sins.
Do not let any man deceive you, there is nothing mankind can do on our own, read the Word of God. KNOW YOU ARE SAVED TODAY ‚ù§"

Things move fast in space but if it was going say a typical 50,000 mph relative to the moon it would be 40x slower. If you consider the diameter of the moon and then you look how fast the meteor in the video is traveling it looks like it's going 2 million miles per hour. At that speed the kinetic energy might just destroy the moon. At a minimum a much larger explosion."

The fastest space craft ever was NASA Parker Solar Probe  that used the sun's gravitational pull to travel 176 km a second.
So there's that too"

This crater is located on the far side of the Moon, which is never visible from Earth. But even if the rocket were to hit somewhere else: On March 4, 2022, the moon is only illuminated by around five percent of sunlight (full moon* is not until March 18) - there is a high probability that you will then see the impact site can, should be low."

11420,bfThiqDd9FA,How exactly did that mushroom cloud form in the vacuum of space?
11421,bfThiqDd9FA,"i‚Äôm no astronomer so i‚Äôm just confused on how they can see that happening when it‚Äôs in space? like even if it‚Äôs a big rocket, the moon is 1000000 times bigger than a rocket so just how when the moon isn‚Äôt even IN the earth it‚Äôs in space"
11422,bfThiqDd9FA,Just dumb
11423,bfThiqDd9FA,meh ..you can clearly se all the craters and holes on the moon are tottaly round and all facing earth because all hits are from earth to the moon
11424,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all the cloud dont just dissipate in that fashion
11425,bfThiqDd9FA,That'll get the wobble out of it!
11426,bfThiqDd9FA,We have a bigger issue if the moon is that close already
11427,bfThiqDd9FA,"wow, its vey realisticüòÇ"
11428,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how large it is relative to the trees
11429,bfThiqDd9FA,lame as hell
11430,bfThiqDd9FA,"OMG, 10M views for a such a lie. Great way of making money! There are two group of people in this world, those who manufacture garbage, and those who buy the garbage. Which group you are in?"
11431,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the bird of my garden that went to the moon
11432,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate people that copy other people and go with the herd. üêë  They lied to you but you lack intellect and are not bright enough too realise
11433,bfThiqDd9FA,Any why an object may crash into the moon while the earth with much stronger gravity is around the corner?
11434,bfThiqDd9FA,if you look really close to the rocket it freezes and it disappeared then the smoke pops out and the rocket is gone but after it freezes it the rocket pops out of nowhere and just before the crash there a light its red and really small but I see it then the ship freezes and then the smoke I dk it looks weird if you look closely you can see it . :)
11435,bfThiqDd9FA,@joerogan
11436,bfThiqDd9FA,Plenty of hits came from the viid though. 1st reaction was omg. Then I thought ah? This is you tube

11491,bfThiqDd9FA,Here for the all the expert commentary from all the people that never been to the moon.
11492,bfThiqDd9FA,You don't have to have been on the moon to know it's bs ^^
11493,bfThiqDd9FA,HeyüëΩthe thing that hit the Moon was the size of TexasüëΩ
11494,bfThiqDd9FA,Seriously?
11495,bfThiqDd9FA,I know what caused that. It was the book with all the allegations of the hundreds of rules broke by Man City.they took it to space and threw it out the window of the iss and it landed on the moon.
11496,bfThiqDd9FA,"I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, show this also to thy servant: whether after death, as soon as every one of us yields up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come when thou wilt renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented at once?"" 76 He answered me and said, ""I will show you that also, but do not be associated with those who have shown scorn, nor number yourself among those who are tormented. 77 For you have a treasure of works laid up with the Most High; but it will not be shown to you until the last times. 

78 Now, concerning death, the teaching is: When the decisive decree has gone forth from the Most High that a man shall die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, first of all it adores the glory of the Most High. 79 And if it is one of those who have shown scorn and have not kept the way of the Most High, and who have despised his law, and who have hated those who fear the Most High -- 80 such spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall immediately wander about in torments, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways. 

81 The first way, because they have scorned the law of the Most High. 82 The second way, because they cannot now make a good repentance that they may live. 83 The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have trusted the covenants of the Most High. 84 The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days. 85 The fifth way, they shall see how the habitations of the others are guarded by angels in profound quiet. 86 The sixth way, they shall see how some of them will pass over into torments. 87 The seventh way, which is worse than all the ways that have been mentioned, because they shall utterly waste away in confusion and be consumed with shame, and shall wither with fear at seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they sinned while they were alive, and before whom they are to be judged in the last times. 

88 ""Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from their mortal body. 89 During the time that they lived in it, they laboriously served the Most High, and withstood danger every hour, that they might keep the law of the Lawgiver perfectly. 90 Therefore this is the teaching concerning them: 91 First of all, they shall see with great joy the glory of him who receives them, for they shall have rest in seven orders.

 92 The first order, because they have striven with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was formed with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death. 93 The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the unrighteous wander, and the punishment that awaits them. 94 The third order, they see the witness which he who formed them bears concerning them, that while they were alive they kept the law which was given them in trust. 95 The fourth order, they understand the rest which they now enjoy, being gathered into their chambers and guarded by angels in profound quiet, and the glory which awaits them in the last days. 96 The fifth order, they rejoice that they have now escaped what is corruptible, and shall inherit what is to come; 

and besides they see the straits and toil from which they have been delivered, and the spacious liberty which they are to receive and enjoy in immortality. 97 The sixth order, when it is shown to them how their face is to shine like the sun, and how they are to be made like the light of the stars, being incorruptible from then on. 98 The seventh order, which is greater than all that have been mentioned, because they shall rejoice with boldness, and shall be confident without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom they served in life and from whom they are to receive their reward when glorified. 

99 This is the order of the souls of the righteous, as henceforth is announced; and the aforesaid are the ways of torment which those who would not give heed shall suffer hereafter."" 100 I answered and said, ""Will time therefore be given to the souls, after they have been separated from the bodies, to see what you have described to me?"" 101 He said to me, ""They shall have freedom for seven days, so that during these seven days they may see the things of which you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered in their habitations."" 

102 I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, show further to me, thy servant, whether on the day of judgment the righteous will be able to intercede for the unrighteous or to entreat the Most High for them, 103 fathers for sons or sons for parents, brothers for brothers, relatives for their kinsmen, or friends for those who are most dear."" 104 He answered me and said, ""Since you have found favor in my sight, I will show you this also. The day of judgment is decisive and displays to all the seal of truth. Just as now a father does not send his son, or a son his father, or a master his servant, or a friend his dearest friend, to be ill or sleep or eat or be healed in his stead, 105 so no one shall ever pray for another on that day, neither shall any one lay a burden on another; for then every one shall bear his own righteousness and unrighteousness."" 2 Esdras 7:75

11575,bfThiqDd9FA,so the moon is that close
11576,bfThiqDd9FA,Of course there'd be a mushroom cloud of sorts it's how it would fall back that would be different remember the feather and the pen on the moon. Close if you look at some of the craters you can see where after the impact debris radiated out from the center. But since we have lots of images of the moon we could go survey the impact area right?
11577,bfThiqDd9FA,The cloud wouldn't have disappeared. That only happens in video games due to hardware limitations.

11579,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkk funny
11580,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everything looks so clear when the rocket crashed into the Moon and exploded and became 10 times slower and blurrier than the actual video

11589,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ridiculous. One second after the impact, the dust is already 1/7 diameter of the moon high, meaning 500km in one second. Many people totaly overestimate this.

12063,bfThiqDd9FA,"It‚Äôs a reasonably cool video. 
Issues were:
What hit the moon had to have been massive
The explosion happened on the exact edge of the moon as it faces Earth. Highly unlikely 
The explosion seemed to stop at one point
The explosion used follows the laws of gravity, sonething sorely lacking on the moon
The explosion seemed to have a left hand bias: that wouldn‚Äôt happen without a more angled approach or wind
That start and cut off points are exactly what we‚Äôd expect from someone creating an explosion video

Still, it was good enough that (worryingly) a number of people thought it genuine 

If it‚Äôs an early start into sievial FX, then well done - same if you were just pissing about - I know I don‚Äôt have the skills, ability or even patience to do better"

If an object the size of the one in the video hit the moon, you'd actually see a really bright flash from the kinetic energy of the impact to boot. It's regular fire that isn't a thing, and sparks don't require oxygen or an atmosphere to occur. (Though you can still produce what's essentially chemical fire of sorts like with hypergolic fuels, where one of the components acts as the oxidizing agent.)"

12643,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, I‚Äôm blown away in so many ways:

First, I didn‚Äôt know we could make such huge rockets! Given the diameter of the moon is 2,159 miles, that means that rocket part is approximately 45 miles big - imagine how big the whole rocket must have been - at least a couple of hundred miles big!

Second, it took about 3.9 seconds for that rocket part to travel the diameter of the moon (2,159 miles). From the equation Speed = Distance/Time, that 45 mile wide rocket part was traveling at approximately 1,977,710 miles per hour. Guys - this means we have the technology to get to Mars in less time than it takes to fly to Paris from New York!! Why are they hiding this from us?!

Third, this is definitive proof that we‚Äôve been lied to about the moon not having an atmosphere - just look at that mushroom cloud! Not only that, but given how high the cloud went it‚Äôs proof that the moon‚Äôs atmosphere is about 8 times thicker than the Earth‚Äôs!

12662,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ChristinaSiddorn-z8w i agree the flat earth SOCIETY is PSYOP for it was started in order to mock, criticize and shame those who were legit speaking out the truth about the biblical cosmology of the earth. But remember the people who suddenly turned from the heliocentric model went to the same schools and were taught the same things as everyone else - that the earth is a globe flying thro space around the sun. The flat earth was a new conversation that really didnt begin until 2015. 
Why was that? 
Its because we are nearing the end of this era of time and the bible says that all mysteries and deceptions will be revealed.

Just look at how much we know now that we did not know even 8 years ago. this is the reason why. God is unveiling all the hidden things that are mysteries of the earth as well as the things hidden by the lies of the elite establishment.
Now we know the world is run by a secret kabal of satan worshipping elites
Now we know why all those children on milk cartons have been missing for 50 years!!!! and where they Wentworth.
Now we know why places like DisneyWorld exist. 
Now we know that Hollywood is a group of perverted, INVERTED psycho satan worshippers.
Now we know that the majority of Hollywood actors are the opposite sex as they present.  

now we know the symbols that Hollywood flashes across all tv shows are an occult hidden language, what they mean and that they are part of the hidden secret satan worship.  We did not know anything about these things even in 2014.
Now we know that all the Apollo missions were a lie and no one has been to the moon. 
now we know the sun is not 93 million miles away.
Now we know that everything we have been taught in school is a lie. The earth is flat. the sun and moon are the same size and run on the same track inside the dome of earth. 
now we know there are other lands beyond what we have been told
Now we know why Antarctica has been protected by a world wide treaty to keep people OUT OF THE TRUTH
Now we know that the elites have been dumbing us down and poisoning with toxic chemicals in our food, air and water.

these are just a few of the things we know now because God has removed the veil off mysteries and deception."

12770,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice Graphic üëç
12771,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice render and video effect. Though the scaling of the smoke cloud should be improved.
Also the smoke cloud physics are wrong. There is no atmosphere to slow down the smoke expansion rate and the gravity too low for such a drastic slowdown. Thus the smoke should expand pretty much with the same speed and constantly getting bigger.
Inner turbulences in the smoke cloud are also wrong, again because of no air to cause such turbulences.
Then the problem of no fire. Even without atmosphere, such an impact would create considerable heat (molten material) which should be visible in a bright flash of light."

12925,bfThiqDd9FA,This is proof the Moon is made of cheese
12926,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket hit the far side of the moon so yes this us bull shit
12927,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the fact that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will return to remove so many things that are just not of his will.
The whole world is passing away and you all are in for a battle for your life."
12928,bfThiqDd9FA,"I don't love anything about this video. The moons diameter is 2159 miles & the 'object' took 4 seconds from 1 diameter away to 'hit', meaning it was traveling at about 500 miles per second. The fireball created from an object maybe 50 miles long would be truly stunning & be the biggest story for many days. And with no atmosphere the jet would fly straight out, except for weak lunar gravity, not billow out."
12929,bfThiqDd9FA,So much love üòÇ
12930,bfThiqDd9FA,
12931,bfThiqDd9FA,"Could you imagine the size of that ""rocket"" to make that kind of impactüòÇ it would be like the grand canyon bull whipping the moon. Good movie quality effects though!"
12932,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkkkkkkkkkk
12933,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf is going on

12939,bfThiqDd9FA,"ah yes, that rocket was filled with 10 nuclear bombs."
12940,bfThiqDd9FA,"Besides the physics breaking explosion, that much of the moon would only be visible and illuminated at night. The moon is illuminated as it the sun is on the opposite side of the earth."

12950,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds serenaded this event
12951,bfThiqDd9FA,moon recorded by 30fps but smoke by 15fps
12952,bfThiqDd9FA,The next meteor is going to split the moon in half causing Cosmic Destruction followed by Thundarr The Barbarian.
12953,bfThiqDd9FA,What
12954,bfThiqDd9FA,of meteore
12955,bfThiqDd9FA,47k actually tick the like

12963,bfThiqDd9FA,This wouldn't happen because cheese isn't dusty.
12964,bfThiqDd9FA,"That ejecta would have to be traveling at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour (at least)

The impact that it would take to do something like that would shatter the whole moon into little bits."

12967,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess at this speed impact flash would be bright as sun and crater would glow for days becoming lava ocean and there would be heavy meteor rain every month for 100 years

13039,bfThiqDd9FA,"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light,‚Äù and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‚Äúday‚Äù and the darkness ‚Äúnight.‚Äù And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day. Then God said, ‚ÄúLet there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.‚Äù And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens. God called the space ‚Äúsky.‚Äù And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.

13047,bfThiqDd9FA,The best part is some how the moon grew an atmosphere. Do you think it hit one of those space ships that land there every week?

13376,bfThiqDd9FA,"Compared to the moon, it is a very large mushroom, it would form more slowly and, moreover, in an atmosphere, the moon has no atmosphere (relatively)"
13377,bfThiqDd9FA,"Its like a science project made by commerce student
.
If a physics student would see it he would kill him selfüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
13378,bfThiqDd9FA,"Clickbait be like ""Did the moon just fart?"""
13379,bfThiqDd9FA,That‚Äôs one big ass moon
13380,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah he normally just records the Moon in broad daylight this is perfectly normal
13381,bfThiqDd9FA,Lazy faker!
13382,bfThiqDd9FA,Nope
13383,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Jesus
13384,bfThiqDd9FA,An object hitting the moon and that speed large enough to be seen with naked eye would do WAY more damage than that.
13385,bfThiqDd9FA,"rockets arent big enough to be seen all the way from the earth when they're at the moon, and that speed is also really hard to achieve for a rocket, and it creating a mushroom cloud is just wrong, it wouldn't be 1 tenth of the moon in size because thats just impossible, maybe for a rocket that size it might look like that but the largest rocket that was ever built and successfully sent to orbit (Saturn V) wouldn't even make a visible cloud of smoke"
13386,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao.... bullshit
13387,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'm willing to bet that one of those different locations was their ass, because that's where this was pulled from...."
13388,bfThiqDd9FA,Hope no one was injured and all are safe. Yes on the moon.
13389,bfThiqDd9FA,In 2023 I m seeing üëÄ this video from heaven

13391,bfThiqDd9FA,I just want to know what phone app he used so I can photo shop a Walmart on the moon. Legend says that the moon is still blowing up farts.
13392,bfThiqDd9FA,love how the explosion is running at 20 fps too thats pretty cool
13393,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp.

13395,bfThiqDd9FA,"The ""dust cloud"" is way too unrealistic."

13429,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats saitama landing on moon when boros punch him
13430,bfThiqDd9FA,"es un montaje, ciencia ficci√≥n, pero si entretiene"
13431,bfThiqDd9FA,My thoughts and prayers are with the rocket üöÄ üôè üò¢
13432,bfThiqDd9FA,But what about Rocket Jr and mrs rocket you monster??
13433,bfThiqDd9FA,Ammm ok. That's not how things work in a vacuum and near zero gravity
13434,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is no atmosphere in space, you would not see a dust plume like that.."
13435,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yo, If the moon are moving that fast what would become of earth's weather"
13436,bfThiqDd9FA,An object travelling at over a million miles an hour.
13437,bfThiqDd9FA,That looks to be about 300 miles across
13438,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun clip.  The dust cloud was done wrong.  The less gravity on the moon would have created a different type of impact cloud.
13439,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought that there is no atmosphere on our moon that would slow down a possible impact cloud like that and make such a cloud. :D
13440,bfThiqDd9FA,This rocket part must be exceptionally huge. Is it made by aliens?

13449,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love all the comments
13450,bfThiqDd9FA,that was saitama when he was fighting boro and got kicked to the moon
13451,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
13452,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is bull, in space the dust would not make that configration as well as how bug the inpact was!  really?"
13453,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you have Zero idea of thermo dynamics, you don't get mushroom clouds in space"
13454,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many times I've seen comments started with I love how üòÇ
13455,bfThiqDd9FA,This is Project Blue Beam

13458,bfThiqDd9FA,üòÇüòÇüòÇ do people actually buy this BS
13459,bfThiqDd9FA,"Get your FX correct.  First, the atmostphere on the moon is different.  The plume wouldn't look like it does on Earth.  Second, speed vs. scale.  The dynamics of the plume are too fast for the size defined against the scale of the moon.   And lastly, the angle of impact does not one up correctly with the angle of the plume."
13460,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that Saitama?
13461,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how so many people watching this even they know this is BS, Oh shit its almost 2:25 am good night."
13462,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to watch the comments. Not the video üòÇ
13463,bfThiqDd9FA,worthless try :(
13464,bfThiqDd9FA,Halp Ukraine
13465,bfThiqDd9FA,Like we'd be able to see a rocket landing on Mars FROM EARTH üíÄ
13466,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to read the lovely comments of the lovely people describing exactly what they love
13467,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm totally for nuking the moon on the fourth of July every year.  Js
13468,bfThiqDd9FA,An object that massive hitting the moon would do more than that... cmon now
13469,bfThiqDd9FA,"DOES EVERYONE START THEIR SENTENCES IN THE SAME FASHION!?!? ' I love how...""  SMH"
13470,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how when you use your cellphone to look at even a car a few km away it's a barely visible pixel but this guy can see better with his cellphone that most telescopes.
13471,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I had to make my comment very specific.

13475,bfThiqDd9FA,"I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt get a sonic boom several seconds after impact. We need a big boom to follow an explosion like that, just seeing it didn‚Äôt really do it for me."
13476,bfThiqDd9FA,source: I saw it on internet.
13477,bfThiqDd9FA,Nur Bl√∂dsinn mein Gott was computer alles macht viele glauben sogar dran
13478,bfThiqDd9FA,claro que s√≠ campe√≥n...
13479,bfThiqDd9FA,On my birthday really!
13480,bfThiqDd9FA,So the Moon is not in Space! As too the Plasma Sun!

13485,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the moons out and its day time
13486,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it took until 2022 to capture this .  Now we know exactly how the moon craters were made .
13487,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon is fartingüòÇ
13488,bfThiqDd9FA,I love what I love and I don't love what I don't love

13494,bfThiqDd9FA,"First of all the moon isn‚Äôt that close to earth, second of all, if something crashed on the moon, an explosion like THAT is not going to be possible at all, you‚Äôre talking a bomb that‚Äôs like 1000 times as powerful as a meteor, thirdly, if an explosion like that DID occur, it wouldn‚Äôt just take on the form of a mushroom cloud that quick."
13495,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all it didn't crash on the moon-

13502,bfThiqDd9FA,How did he know when to tape to moon fart? I never see it on time! This guy filmed it!
13503,bfThiqDd9FA,Poo
13504,bfThiqDd9FA,Lack of camera tracking skill
13505,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh no!! Now all the airs gonna escape!!
13506,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy that you saw that and managed to film it praise god.
13507,bfThiqDd9FA,"Appears from behind a cloud. 
Crashes into the moon at almost the speed of light.
Fades into a 10 fps but high resolution mushroom cloud.
Refuses to elaborate."
13508,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't love anything.
13509,bfThiqDd9FA,Out of the explosion forms and rests a beautiful white rose on the moon üíï

13514,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video makes my mind wander
13515,bfThiqDd9FA,How amazing you just happened to be outside with your camera at that time and you just happened to be able to look up and see that this was happening. You must be psychic or something....... GTFO here ya nutdack!
13516,bfThiqDd9FA,Not to mention the debris cloud dissapating in mere seconds instead of lingering for months or years as would actually occur.
13517,bfThiqDd9FA,Caralho
13518,bfThiqDd9FA,How does this video have 7.3 million views. The internet is filled with mentally handicaped people.
13519,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love that this happend 10 months ago, and same person filmed it :O so random"
13520,bfThiqDd9FA,Jesus is watchin...

13535,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh wow it's 20 fps in space, didn't know our cameras can crack it.."
13536,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much love was found watching this loveable clip of a much loved natural monument that we've all im sure have know and loved from childhood to adult as have many generations in the past have loved it also. Hopefully our much loved moon is around for many generations more to find reasons why they the love this clip so much also.
13537,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments

13545,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how üíÉ
13546,bfThiqDd9FA,That thing gave the whole moon  atmosphere while getting blown up to add some drama to the clip :-)
13547,bfThiqDd9FA,It is what they want you to believe... the moon is a plasma and reflects the earth. Greetings from Venezuela. the truth is beyond the ice barriers.
13548,bfThiqDd9FA,I enjoyed that.
13549,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see where the trans dks that were cut were being sent too.
13550,bfThiqDd9FA,Not sure if it was a quantum or photon tornado ü§î

13553,bfThiqDd9FA,0:27
13554,bfThiqDd9FA,this is absolutely hoax. manipulated image. holy crap!
13555,bfThiqDd9FA,its not a manipulated image.  look again.

13558,bfThiqDd9FA,yes very realistic
13559,bfThiqDd9FA,"What is loooooove anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway.... wooah ... oooohh..."
13560,bfThiqDd9FA,moon is to see with love not for  this kind of activity.
13561,bfThiqDd9FA,Alot of Love in these comments üòèüíñ
13562,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does moon looks bigger on video when we see it on earth smaller
13563,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my wife
13564,bfThiqDd9FA,Now i know who asked
13565,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how this person put‚Ä¶. View from a different location.

That statement right there shows that this person knows absolutely nothing about the moon or probably anything else 

Doesn‚Äôt matter where you are on the Earth. The moon is tidally locked in earths orbit, so we will always see the same face of the moon, no matter where we are on the planet so if the moon is out and you can see it in California or Boston, you‚Äôre seeing the exact same thing

Beyond that this video, I‚Äôll be an interesting is a complete fabrication because an explosion on the moon would not look like a mushroom cloud because there is no atmosphere 

Learn how physics works and try again"
13566,bfThiqDd9FA,All comments here starting with..I loveüòÆ
13567,bfThiqDd9FA,Bit bit bit bit bit
13568,bfThiqDd9FA,It's the same thing on why people think we have been to the moon! We can't even get out of low earth orbit. You have been scammed humans.
13569,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love How We BrainWash Each other ..till the Point.. We don't believe in Anything even With Proof..  sad reality And I love how Everyone in comments has Been to Space
13570,bfThiqDd9FA,All the comments making fun of the timing and the effects. Bit does nobidy notice how big the moon is?
13571,bfThiqDd9FA,"You'd think an explosion several thousand miles high and across, to be seen from there, would have a huge shockwave..."
13572,bfThiqDd9FA,prophet muhommad cut moon into 2 pieces
13573,bfThiqDd9FA,Optical Flares but no good enough.
13574,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in sunlight
13575,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm disappointed I suckered myself into watching this trash
13576,bfThiqDd9FA,What do you love about this video ?
13577,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud didn't take 6x's longer to settle

13579,bfThiqDd9FA,I love beer.
13580,bfThiqDd9FA,love how many views from a single effect

13582,bfThiqDd9FA,i love that a comment being confused about the authenticity of the video was pinned
13583,bfThiqDd9FA,i just love comment sections like this.
13584,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love how NASA just had a rocket the size of Manhattan flying around with a speed of several hundred kilometers per second, instantaneously creating an explosion roughly the size of texas"
13585,bfThiqDd9FA,It's amazing that guy knew exact moment when something would hit the moon.

13596,bfThiqDd9FA,"false because if the moon was hit by a meteor, the earth's gravity would be gone and we humans would float on air"
13597,bfThiqDd9FA,"Has anyone actually read the full description in the thumb nail, they say its an old rocket part thats been flying around for years and its going to hit the moon, nasa are excited to see the outcome plus the new crater which MIGHT be as big as 65ft (20 meters) OMG, yes its total nonsense, i didn't know we had built rockets the size of large countries, and after being used they speed up to about 10% the speed of light!!!"

13613,bfThiqDd9FA,The headassery here is unfathomable
13614,bfThiqDd9FA,I dont got anything smart to say. but I have to continue with the trend so I love how the birds were signaling that something was going to happen to get the camera man's attention to look at the right place at the right time to capture a once in a life time event.

13624,bfThiqDd9FA,So natural like a runway lights
13625,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon has 100km radius craters and we didn‚Äôt saw that Happen, the moon is so far you‚Äôll never see something like that"
13626,bfThiqDd9FA,"This comment section is less fucked than I anticipated as I read the title and watched that preposterous horse shit. Thank god . Also that was legitimately hilarious, why? People literally subscribe to propaganda. Viral. Boom first red flag in seemingly any context. Fed up with virus and space bullshit. To the 45 thousand likes, any of those which are not bots, the fuck? Get with it and stop participating gleefully with this propogated hysterical and broadcast ignorance. If we stop playing along, all of us, everywhere, if all of us stopped voting and using money and paying taxes and working in industry and using money and buying anything and we grew out food and sense of community and self and the divine and truth. I have never lived in a world of truth where information passed by and through my knowing was wholly true, in fact seemingly mostly untrue, and the truths were mainly self evident since I can remember, common sense aspects of living apparent in nature. What is this artifice we possess of and endear. The reason objective and critical thought appear lost in the screens is because it is writ to be so. Social media and media of any kind beyond the pure and honest pursuit of knowledge wisdom and information from a respectable source is jolly, cheers. Expression by writ word of all kinds, or any work of effort of hand or heart, or a means to display such things, lovely, I imagine social media could be sociable if you extricate the media from it, and otherwise abandon ship, BCS the obstinance and psychosis of being battered by ads and sensless frivolous bullshit is onset and cumulative and level heads will prevail until they don't, any thing moving and stumble and any stumble can lead to a fall. Spirals go on, and return to themselves. When all else fails reject unnatural impetus and turn inward, and outward into nature and then come back to yourself. Beautiful things are everywhere and distraction in nature is simply observation."
13627,bfThiqDd9FA,"could you rephrase that, please?"
13628,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone know if the moon is okay?  Someone needs to go over there and check on things.

The new Premier would help that dust cloud transition, and distance gauging. Then your moon won't look like it's about to hit us, and you dust cloud will obey Einstein's law about light speed. Be pretty sweet for a commercial or something though, where it would use that unbelievability to it's benefit. Like something for a car, or HEY!

Second, from the equation Speed = Distance/Time, that 45 mile wide rocket part was traveling at approximately 1,977,710 miles per hour - this means we have the technology to get to Mars in 7 hours!!

14294,bfThiqDd9FA,@@OmarTheAtheistAziz well said..üíØ
14295,bfThiqDd9FA,Look at the little black speck below it looking to be pulling it
14296,bfThiqDd9FA,@@perrinaybara8551  A mushroom cloud. In practically zero atmosphere. Which is what makes mushroom clouds possible - as well as the whole slow motion look these clouds have in motion. Right... I believe in mushroom clouds on the moon. And in tin foil hats. /s
14297,bfThiqDd9FA,"What's the distance?  The sky is blue all around the moon.  Not black like you see in all NASA pics.  On the day of the ""moon landing"" the moon was in waxing crescent and they supposedly landed in the Sea Of Tranquility.  If that's the case it would have been dark where they were, but the sun was shining brightly according to NASA."
14298,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948 Where to even begin?
Do you know why the sky *on Earth* is blue during the day? No, it's not because of the sun. It's because the sunlight gets refracted in Earth's atmosphere. If it weren't for the atmosphere, the sky would be black.
Now, the moon has no atmosphere worth mentioning. (The occasional helium atom floating around on its way into seep space does NOT count.) So, there's nothing there to light up the sky around the moon during the day.
And while the moon was definitely waxing, it was nearly half-full. (I checked with three different sites.) which means that the Sea of Tranquility was most definitely in the light.
You really need to learn to check your ""facts""."
14299,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@melanien5599 It was crescent, which is NOT half full.  And I didn't say it was blue because of the sun.  I just noted that the sky all around the moon was blue."
14300,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948  It was an almost half-full crescent. At 42% full or some such. Still fitting the term ""crescent"", but far from a mere sliver of light only on the rightmost edge (as viewed from Earth). Once again: Check. Your. Facts!
And where did you get the idea that the sky all around the moon has to be blue??? Inquiring minds want to know."
14301,bfThiqDd9FA,@@melanien5599 Hi.  What's your email address?
14302,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@melanien5599 Well, it's blue during the day.  Okay, I stand corrected, but why are the shadows going from left to right on some pics, but right to left on others?  The sun would have been on the left side of the 42% phase."
14303,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948  Take a photo of a tree (or whatever else you please) when the sun is shining. See where the sun is in relation to the photographed tree. Now walk around the tree (or whatever your object of choice was) until you've walked half a circle. Take another pic of the same object. And - surprise, surprise! -  the sun is shining from the opposite side.
It's one of the many mysteries of photography. If you don't believe me, try it out with your phone camera.  I guess this just proves that someone must have been walking around on the moon. During the moon landing. Big surprise there!"
14304,bfThiqDd9FA,@@melanien5599 How profound!  The sun would still be shining in the same direction with the shadow pointing in the same direction.  Duh.

14540,bfThiqDd9FA,I love‚Ä¶ too
14541,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah because someone just happened to be standing in the perfect spot to be clear of those clouds.. filming the moon in daylight because... There is where it falls apart. There is no legitimate reason for anyone to be filming the moon including the perfect angle and squared up scene. So anyone want to pretend they have a good reason to stand filming the moon all day just drop those reasons in the reply box
14542,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cupcakes
14543,bfThiqDd9FA,I love moon

14578,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this proves the moon is local to us and not 238 thousand miles away.
14579,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao this uses the exact same bird sound loop my gf uses to fall asleep
14580,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you. Each of you.

14584,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
14585,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mil mensajes diciendo ""i love how"" puros bots"
14586,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you forgot to set your frame rate to the same frame rate as the rest of the video. Just get it right before you work on the marvel movie.
14587,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how so great the video is
14588,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact was so immense that the frame rate of the dust cloud didn't even match the original video
14589,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's just some lag, no biggie."
14590,bfThiqDd9FA,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
14591,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the impact is right on the edge of the moon as we see it, so the explosion doesn't interfere with it."
14592,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is a conspiracy from China to wipe Neil Armstrong's footprints with a nuclear warhead in order to claim the moon for themselves, which in the end is nothing more than a big while balloon floating in the sky, but without cameras (yet)"
14593,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how everybody loves something about the video but not the video itself
14594,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they exactly know when to capture this iconic moment
14595,bfThiqDd9FA,I love ‚ù§ how the moon üåô farts white ‚ö™ immediately
14596,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust expands at 12 fps
14597,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why the dust disappear just a few second after the impact ? There is no dense atmosphere on the Moon, so the dust should stay visible for a long period, not just a few second !!!"
14598,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE
14599,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that this is not a thing.
14600,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon was trying to dodge but failed
14601,bfThiqDd9FA,was it 43T hit?
14602,bfThiqDd9FA,"i hate, how everyone is repeating,""i love...""this n that"

14605,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that you all should watch Brave Girls - Goodbye MV üòÅ
14606,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the rocket said ""it's moonin' time"" and smacked the moon."
14607,bfThiqDd9FA,"Can totally vouch for this. Was about 250 miles away, just stepped out of the landing module for a smoke when all of a sudden - there it was. Never forget it."
14608,bfThiqDd9FA,"Congratulations. You are the only person in the comments section that didn't start with ""I love how...""  Lemmings."
14609,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the sound off bird whole time..

14611,bfThiqDd9FA,That wasnt a dust cloud that was hundreds of thousands of Chinese dude covid breath air that all took turns blowing up that balloon.  Now we have China air here
14612,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how 99 percent of the comments start with I love how ü§î
14613,bfThiqDd9FA,This is cinema
14614,bfThiqDd9FA,Cg
14615,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the year NASA blew up a alien civilization on the on the moon
14616,bfThiqDd9FA,But I thought the cow jumped over the moon. Stupid cow.
14617,bfThiqDd9FA,I died laughing the little explosion cloud was soo cute
14618,bfThiqDd9FA,Nahh the rocket said ‚ÄúJIMMY WAIT FOR ME‚Äù
14619,bfThiqDd9FA,I love myself
14620,bfThiqDd9FA,I love mac and cheese.
14621,bfThiqDd9FA,look how choppy the explosion was plus you wouldn't see the object that's about to hit it the only reason you see the moon is because it's bigl enough to bounce sunlight to earth of itself
14622,bfThiqDd9FA,Something that big hitting the moon would move it. At least that's my opinion.
14623,bfThiqDd9FA,Any extinctions?
14624,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how despite this being on of the largest explosions ever recorded the brave camera man has zero reaction to the disaster
14625,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust and debris plume just all of a sudden disappears.  Where did it all go??  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
14626,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you blamed the Chinese for this
14627,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm different.
14628,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely faked. Good one.
14629,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how watching this video really makes me love how watching this video really makes me love how
14630,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the rocket hit yer mum
14631,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how im late to this i love how

14637,bfThiqDd9FA,I love going through the comments.
14638,bfThiqDd9FA,i love you all
14639,bfThiqDd9FA,Mais oui c‚Äôest clair
14640,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that i missed that event and be informed through this video
14641,bfThiqDd9FA,rocket travels at 30 FPS.. dust cloud expands at 5 FPS jjajjajaj
14642,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how another ‚Äòobject‚Äô appears out of thin-air just before impact.
14643,bfThiqDd9FA,everything else is not lagging from the camera but the dust cloud is going like 5 frames a secone
14644,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud expanded in vacuum as if it was in an atmosphere
14645,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that's my favorite part
14646,bfThiqDd9FA,true
14647,bfThiqDd9FA,"It does indeed! Because the kinetic energy accelerates the dust particles, and they are getting attracted by each other creating sort of turbulences. There are several experiments proving it. BUT in this video OMG It's behaving like in air or fluid!"
14648,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how an object at that speed would‚Äôve shattered the moon
14649,bfThiqDd9FA,Esattoüéâ
14650,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people believe we can have an atmosphere in a vacuum with no barrier üòÇ
14651,bfThiqDd9FA,"Noone questions how we can have a sea without a barrier but a sea of air in a vacuum is impossible? Things don‚Äôt turn weightless in a vacuum, so any particla will be attracted to the nearest body. That is how we can have a atmosphere in a vacuum, because just like the air won‚Äôt pull the water out of the sea, the vacuum can‚Äôt pull the air out of the atmosphere. There is no force counteracting that the gases stays on the planet, other than possibly solar wind from which we are protected by earths very powerful magbetosphere."
14652,bfThiqDd9FA,Npc
14653,bfThiqDd9FA,@@scottd7222 ... I love how your tiny little brain can't comprehend how that is exactly how it is.
14654,bfThiqDd9FA,"‚Äã@@scottd7222First of all, space isn't a vacuum. Secondly the atoms in the Athmosphere decrease gradually so there's no hard 'border' to space"

14658,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
14659,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the clouds are pushed back just a little so we could have a good visual... and a tree for a good perspective.
14660,bfThiqDd9FA,What don‚Äôt you love about this ?
14661,bfThiqDd9FA,poor moon :(

14674,bfThiqDd9FA,Another balloon popped
14675,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon has about a 3500 km diameter. Which means this explosion went about 1000km from the surface. I also didn‚Äôt know that when explosions happen they go frame by frame so you can really see what‚Äôs happeningüôÑ
14676,bfThiqDd9FA,ü§£
14677,bfThiqDd9FA,Good god that was a massive object. I think that would have probably fucked the moon up pretty good. That was MASSIVE gotta make stuff realistic at least.

14827,bfThiqDd9FA,1. The speed wasn't fast enough to create a gas cloud that high and 2. How bright the blue sky is right now during the day you should not be able to see the gas cloud at all. There's the proof
14828,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope this is a joke right?
14829,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon is so bright for daytime

14923,bfThiqDd9FA,"In earnest, it seems to be the way nowadays to describe something ironically and with a certain disdain. Maybe one day 'I love how' suffers the same fate as 'literally', which has become its own antonym - for being used too often ironically. Similar to 'I have a theory' that rendered from an ironic remark for 'I have a hunch' to being understood as admission of utter cluelessness... 'But it's ""only"" a theory'."

15202,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon IS in our atmosphere. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to see it. Just like the stars are in our atmosphere. There is a firmament, as it is described in the Bible, which surrounds the earth and protects our atmosphere (and us) from various debris from other planets, although the Bible never confirms that there are any other solar planets. The earth's firmament is the reason why we can be certain that no one will ever actually be going to Mars or that we will never be invaded by aliens from another planet. 

This video is capturing a star crashing into the moon, in my opinion, and the Bible tells us that the stars are ANGELS. So, the moon would be where the fallen angels reside (on the dark side and inside). Many blessings on your journey to the truth of our existence. The truth is in the Bible, not in 'space,' as there is actually no such thing in my opinion. NASA is simply Lucifer, that adversarious fallen cherub's, brain child. 

There is a Creator and His angels, and there is Lucifer and his angels. And the latter are in control of the MOON, which is why humans have never been back to the moon since the (supposed only) moon landing. Question everything, my friend. Time is running out.üïä"

15320,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how when it crashed into the side of the moon...bearing in mind, the sun and the moon can affect our weather patterns and our tide patterns the like, there was no fall out from this event!!
I also love like the camera guy was just standing there filming knowing what was going to happen!!
I also love the fact that we can do anything with CG I!!
Oh and that there was no notifications from NASA that a commet has hit the moon at such a force, that the blast and fall out could be seen from Earth!!
Oh yeah, and there was such clarity in this picture that one could assume people knew what was going to happen before the rest of the world!!
Oh and that the blast fall out did not linger or blow anything out from the moon into our orbit!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

15334,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds had no care at all to what was going on and were just singing merrily!
15335,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you set your camera  before the ""impact"" occurs.  And I really love how bright the moon was in the middle of daylight. I just love everything! Especially your imagination and creativity, and it's a good thing. Don't let other people tell you otherwise."

15569,bfThiqDd9FA,@@MrJustesting evidence
15570,bfThiqDd9FA,"@MrJustesting¬† just because something appears close doesn't mean it is. The moon doesn't change its position based on conjecture. It may be hard to comprehend distances that far, but Eratosthenes did. In 276-194 BC Eratosthenes realized the Sun had to be directly overhead Syene, or at its zenith, on that day. He also knew the Sun was 7 degrees away from the zenith at Alexandria on the solstice (which happens to be about 1/50th of the circumference of a circle). Using simple geometry, Eratosthenes then showed that this implied that the distance from Alexandria to Syene was 1/50th of the Earth‚Äôs circumference. Using the rate that the average camel could travel, and the number of days that it took a camel to travel from Alexandria to Syene, he estimated that the distance from Syene to Alexandria was 5000 stadia. Since he had calculated this distance to also be 1/50th of the Earth‚Äôs circumference, then 50 times 5000 stadia yields 250,000 stadia for the Earth‚Äôs circumference. Now the stadium (singular of stadia) had different lengths in ancient times. Traditionally, it is assumed that there are 6 stadia in a kilometer (km), meaning that Eratosthenes found the Earth‚Äôs circumference to be about 42,000 km (26,000 mi.) The circumference of the Earth is just its average diameter, 7915 miles, times the number pi, where pi is 3.14159. This gives us about 25,000 miles for the Earth‚Äôs circumference. So Eratosthenes only missed the circumference by approximately 4 percent. This was truly remarkable precision for 2200 years ago."

The diameter of the Moon is 2,159 miles; If we were to assume a rocket is 300 ft long and 25 ft wide, it's length would be 1/34,000th of the diameter of the Moon!  If the moon were the size of a basketball, the rocket next to it would be 1/50th of a millimeter long and 1/500th of a millimeter wide!  The length would be less than the width of the thinnest human hair! You wouldn't even see it! Human eye resolution is not that good!  This object was much larger!  More like 1/200th to 1/100th of a moon diameter or in other words ten to twenty miles in diameter!  Why are our NASA scientists and news media not stating the obvious, that this is not a rocket?  Also, eyeballing the velocity of this object it travelled one moon diameter in about 5 seconds which would mean it was moving about 2,159/5 miles per second (430 miles per second) or 1.5 million miles per hour.  The plume from this meteor impact rose about 500 miles in just seconds, an amazing event!"

15761,bfThiqDd9FA,rocket flying faster than moons orbit
15762,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not a single one of you mofos know anything about what it's like to land on the moon. You don't know how smoke acts on the moon.  You don't have a clue about the physics of the moon. You ain't been there, and you ain't going there. So quit acting like you know because you don't. Duh .."
15763,bfThiqDd9FA,What are you talking about? That people say that dust cloud is to big? It definitely is!
15764,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon has no atmosphere so the dust would fall back pretty quickly
15765,bfThiqDd9FA,That's not how this works ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
15766,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 so how it works?
15767,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jozkomrkvicka7607 it flys up and away, not make a cloud. Some of it would come down, but not after a long time."
15768,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@thecyanadon it depends on the Power of the Explosion if you do not reach escape velocity then it falls back. The moons escape velocity is ca. 8500km/h which was not reached, so it should fall down as quick as it went up."
15769,bfThiqDd9FA,"Space is amazing, look at that dust travelling at the speed of light almost - mind blown."

15777,bfThiqDd9FA,And?
15778,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 huh?
15779,bfThiqDd9FA,Is there anything more beautiful then a soft pair of butt cheeks?

15782,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 it can not make a cloud.
15783,bfThiqDd9FA,There would be a bright explosion like the shoemaker impact on jupiter. Also the reason for mushroom clouds on earth is our atmosphere. It would look more like firework on the moon.
15784,bfThiqDd9FA,I loved the smell of cheese in the air the next day !
15785,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes!!! All that time filming the moon for no apparent reason has finally paid off!!

15793,bfThiqDd9FA,I think what we witnessed was the Coyote hitting the moon after the Road Runner shot him there with a giant sling shot.

15814,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait a minute. I thought the moon was about 283,855 miles from earth! Then how can you possibly even see something like this! We are not being told the truth!!!"
15815,bfThiqDd9FA,"You guys really love a lot of stuff, I love that"
15816,bfThiqDd9FA,Why tell us that was a rocket ???? The moon is coverd in creators from impacts of asteriods/comets so couldn't that of been a asteriod??? Its not a rocket why would we crash a rocket into the moon and who did it??? Also wouldn't a rocket come from earth I mean look at it it's hitting from the side of the moon from space ??????

15821,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a moon fart
15822,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ok so its a vacuum. There is basically no atmosphere on the moon, though it can be debated there is a tiny bit. The dust could in fact travel at insanely high speeds as there is no air, so nothing to slow even the smallest particles down. There would be no mushroom cloud though. Air causes the mushroom cloud to be able to form. It would look more like a giant splash. Like throwing a rock at a puddle."
15823,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many people love so much about this clip... pity there wasn't  more love like this in day to day life.  With a love so great just think what we could do!!!    One love!
15824,bfThiqDd9FA,Total click bait

15830,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon's diameter (length from side to side) is about 3,500 km,

15845,bfThiqDd9FA,"And the cloud didn't disperse along the moon's surface, it just went up like a bomb that went off. Things like that don't even go that high up down here when they hit the ground unless it's a nuclear bomb."

15858,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how there's no actual way dust could possibly travel that fast
15859,bfThiqDd9FA,Love nonsense and very common these days
15860,bfThiqDd9FA,"I also believe there is no way we would see a small rocket clearly hit the moon when the moon is almost 250,000 miles away. I‚Äôve seen my fair share of launches and you can‚Äôt see the rocket anymore after a few minutes and considering it takes a few days to reach the moon I don‚Äôt think so."
15861,bfThiqDd9FA,A few days it takes 6 months to reach the moon from Earth
15862,bfThiqDd9FA,@@DreDre286 no it‚Äôs only 2.5 to 4 days to reach the moon with the current rocket systems. It takes 5-10 months with a 7 month average to reach Mars so you are mistaking the length of time to reach the moon with the length of time to reach Mars. Jupiter can take about a year and a half to two years to get to. They are much farther than the moon. Neil Armstrong and crew got to the moon and back in just a week.
15863,bfThiqDd9FA,@Call me by your name why would NASA kidnap some random people and hold them captive to film a moon video when they could just hire people and train them with their budget to not  reveal secrets and look scared on TV? What??
15864,bfThiqDd9FA,there is no air soo there should be no mushroom dust explosion or anything in the first place

15878,bfThiqDd9FA,"The gravity of the Moon is 1 sixth that of Earth's.   There is no atmosphere.  The resistance to the expantion would be miniscule.  
         The thing that makes obvious the video is faked is the mushroom cloud.
A mushroom cloud is formed after an explosion.   When the atmosphere rushes in, filling a vacuum  created by the explosion.   No atmosphere, no mushroom cloud.
  An impact would have a different signature cloud."
15879,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he/she edited this videoüòç
15880,bfThiqDd9FA,"I actually think it's pretty well done. I doubt that too many people would care to read that wall of text, though."
15881,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun stuff!!!
15882,bfThiqDd9FA,My favorite part about the dust cloud is that it‚Äôs more in focus than the rest of the moon
15883,bfThiqDd9FA,nice framedrops on the crash animation
15884,bfThiqDd9FA,Physics are way off. Looks like Wile E. Coyote and road runner are going at it on the moon...ü§≠

How come 99% of comments have same starting üòÇ"
15886,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody in the comments is writing I love how.
15887,bfThiqDd9FA,"many commenters here watch too many marvel movies, their mental line is blurred between reality and fiction"
15888,bfThiqDd9FA,"Too fast, the object is moving at 818km/s. The fastest man made orbiting object is 109km/s 
Too big, the object is 80km across. The largest man made object in space is the HSS which is 109m end to end.

To calculate the speed of the object; Object is moving 1 moon diameter in 4.25 seconds. Diameter of the Moon is 3475km divided by the time 4.25 seconds is 818km/s.
The diameter of the object is 43 times smaller than the moon(3475km), so that would make the object a massive 80km across.

If you want the speed of the cloud it is 434km/s, that's 0.144666667% the speed of light.
Moon diameter 3'475km
Dust cloud travelling 1/8th the diameter of the moon in 1 second 
1/8th diameter of Moon is 434km
That's 434km/s
Speed of light 300'000km/s"

15926,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon is not that close, This is just awesome visual effects"
15927,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does/ how does an object approach the moon from such a sharp sideways angle as opposed to colliding into the moon directly from above which is what any object would do under gravity. It would fall straight downwards and not travel downwards at an obvious sideways angle? This is bullshit unless the object was steered and propelled into the side of the moon which I think it was.

But nah, huge object traveling at INSANE speeds toward the moon, crashes into it and causes an explosion not even half the size it should've but still strong enough to cause severe damage, and all you see is a plume of dust"
15954,bfThiqDd9FA,"People dont believe anything yet the same people are  so easly mislead they wont believe if god came down from the heavens they would say "" I love how the dust..... üòÇ"

15957,bfThiqDd9FA,"Total crap,,,,,,,,,,"
15958,bfThiqDd9FA,"I luv how we forgot that China, Russia, and USA are going to war on Earth to fool the masses that we are enemies. Meanwhile, they are sharing technology and helping each other clone humans, build artificial moons to block the sun in near future. Remember USA saved southern China from Japan, Russia save Europe From Nazis, and the US, Middle East, Egypt allowed JEWS (JerusalemExiledWhiteSatanist) ""Flying carpet"". SMH, I pray the TRUE White brotherhood returns before they nuke us while they hide underground or on the moon."

15978,bfThiqDd9FA,the idea of providing a lie in the caption to get people to open it should not be allowed. IT is a shame that I have to even open it to notify you tube is wrong as it gives the impression that i am interested in this garbage

15991,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how 5 million people watched this
15992,bfThiqDd9FA,"A meteor landed on the moon i saw that
That's why it was a explotion there"
15993,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon farted

16009,bfThiqDd9FA,That must be a huge ass rocket if you can see it from earth hahaha even starlink flying in leo you can barely see it at night and lets not talk about the speed and the wrong angle of the dust cloud nice try tho
16010,bfThiqDd9FA,This is exzactly what we all watched on the news with the towers. Impossible to physics.
16011,bfThiqDd9FA,"Was that a supermassive nuke or something? I am not an idiot, there is no fucking way a small ass wannabe space junk rocket can cause such a big explosion."
16012,bfThiqDd9FA,"The dust cloud expands to 1/4 of the moons diameter in about 5 seconds.
That's roughly 175 km per second, or 626,000 kph (389,000 mph).
Even without an atmosphere, that seems a tad too fast."
16013,bfThiqDd9FA,bro there is no gravity in the moon
16014,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that I'm commenting here for no good reason.
16015,bfThiqDd9FA,After effects is good
16016,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon must have grown a much bigger atmosphere to hold that dust cloud in shape....
16017,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people see that thumbnail and go to see the video thinking is true.

16028,bfThiqDd9FA,"knowing that the moon is less visible during the day, this is definitely debunked. we are so far away from the moon, i highly guarantee we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see what‚Äôs happening on it"
16029,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the moon is so close
16030,bfThiqDd9FA,"great, they have contaminated the cheese."
16031,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon just sits there and takes it.
16032,bfThiqDd9FA,can you imajine if it moved out of the way at the last second? that would make me throw up .

16050,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you came up with that.
16051,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket that is the size of Rhode Island takes about 4 seconds to cover the diameter of the moon equating to roughly 2 million miles per hour.  Thats the fastest thing in the solar system by a couple orders of magnitude!
16052,bfThiqDd9FA,Fair point! Didnt think of that.
16053,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that how youtube's algorithm recommends the comments that have I LOVE THAT on top

16064,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cloud wouldn‚Äôt have looked like that and wouldn‚Äôt have disappeared that fast. This would have been all over the news and the size of that object would have destroyed the moon

16186,bfThiqDd9FA,"so like you mean a new screw somewhere elce on earth recorded the same event and managed to see how it all looked on the far side?  Wicked.

when they played both at the same time did it look 3d?"
16187,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@sustayne one video shows something coming from the right side and the other video shows som9ething coming from the left side. It's supposedly the same thing so that means both side of the moon is lit up at the same time, but it's not supposed to be that way, its supposed to be dark on one side and lit up on the other"
16188,bfThiqDd9FA,NASA did it
16189,bfThiqDd9FA,I love reading the comments
16190,bfThiqDd9FA,Reasonable explanation: someone was playing bo3 zombies on der eisendrache and accidentally launched the rocket instead of letting it do its test and launched it.
16191,bfThiqDd9FA,They were listening to the Free Bird Guitar Solo while landing (FBGS means there is no slowing down)
16192,bfThiqDd9FA,That must've been one big explosion for the fact that you can see it from that far-
16193,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'm still wondering how a less than 1 mile piece of shoemaker made an earth sized fireball and scar on Jupiter even as it only hit clouds and impacts on earth of that size didn't even do that....

16230,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud had to be at the exact perimeter of a round object as if this was a 2d reality. Just so the background of the sky could make the dustcloud stand out

Do NOT talk to the earth!! Its slave trading with aliens and kidnapping the strong, women and kids to get revenge on people without true reason!

It also paraphrases and bullies the person into depression and desperation for fun and to make the person vulnerable to alien abductions.

The planet earth has now become a biological retard due to space junk and indoctrination. It may even be prematurely retarded as to it becoming a weaponized tool."

16447,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno No, Sound is a mechanical wave.  A mechanical wave is oscillating molecules (matter) moving through matter.  Sound can only move through a vacuum in the form of radio waves, which are electromagnetic waves, that can then be transferred into mechanical waves once they pass through matter.  So, it is not sound moving through space, it is light that is then transferred into sound.  Basically, the opposite of Sonar, using sound to see."
16448,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dallassegno there's nothing in the void of space to carry the sound. Sound needs something to vibrate like air.
16449,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno You apparently don‚Äôt know how physics works. Sound is a mechanical wave/energy, thus requiring a medium to travel or transfer energy. Sound cannot travel through space because it is a vacuum, which means there are no particles of matter in contact to transfer mechanical energy waves like sound."
16450,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dallassegno sound is molecules vibrating dinglenuts‚Ä¶ if there is no fluid such as air or water there is so sound‚Ä¶ask any physicist or astrophysicist. There is NO sound in the static vacuum of space.
16451,bfThiqDd9FA,Sound can't travel through a vacuum!  That's why I can't hear the phone ring when my wife is vacuuming the carpet! (joke borrowed from my brother)!ü§£
16452,bfThiqDd9FA,I hear nothing but birds chirping
16453,bfThiqDd9FA,I listened to this at max volume with noise canceling headphones. There is no sound
16454,bfThiqDd9FA,@@D3THL0CKE the coward probably removed the sound after reading this then
16455,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno if sound was able to move through space, we would probably be hearing the sun roaring like a chainsaw right by your eardrums"

16457,bfThiqDd9FA,@@matimus100 What is it with you and suggesting everyone in is love. Weird.
16458,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno So, you showed how little you know about physics while trying to show how someone else doesn't know about physics... must be hard being this dumb"
16459,bfThiqDd9FA,I can hear the wind whistling eagerly at the particular moment
16460,bfThiqDd9FA,There's sound? Ouch
16461,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno I think it‚Äôs you who doesn‚Äôt understand how physics work. Space is literally defined by a lack of ‚Äústuff‚Äù, if you will. And let‚Äôs say sound could travel through space, it would need to travel 238,000 miles, and it would have dissipated a long time before it reaches earth. And let‚Äôs say through all of that, if we could hear the sound of impact, it would take approximately 14 days for the sound to reach earth."

16465,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ngl, I raised the volume right before impact"
16466,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno How can sound travel through a lack of material? Sound reverberates through air, bounces off objects, as it bounces its waves lengthen out until the point of dissipation. There's absolutely no way anyone would audibly hear the impact."

The moon has always been Earth's protective shield. 
In ancient times, shortly before the birth of Rome, a legend speaks of the birth of Venus, apparently following a celestial collision between Jupiter and an unknown star. 
There was then a great game of billiards between the planets before they stabilized at their current locations. 
The ancients speak of a titanic battle between Venus and Mars which came dangerously close in its new elliptical course to such an extent that the mood of the populations at each approach of the star was modified at its approach to such an extent that the woman was fighting against her husband, brother against brother, Nations against others.. 
Then one day, when Mars was getting dangerously close to the Earth, Athena or Venus (?), used the Moon as a Shield . The shock was terrible, and Mars was sent to its current trajectory. 
It would seem, still according to the ancients, that gigantic lightning struck the Earth in such a way that the places where they raged literally melted and that a city entire state was totally vitrified in an instant. (Legend of the destruction of Sodom? ) 
Anyway, since then Mars has become the planet of War and Venus that of love. 
This is what I have been able to find from my research in ancient writings .. .

La lune a toujours √©t√© le bouclier de protection de la Terre. 
Dans les temps anciens, un peu avant la naissance de Rome, une l√©gende parle de la naissance de V√©nus, suite semble-t-il d'une collision c√©leste entre  Jupiter et un astre inconnu. 
Se trama alors une grande partie de billard entre les plan√®tes avant qu'elles ne se stabilisent √† leurs emplacements actuels. 
Les anciens parlent d'un combat titanesque entre Venus et Mars qui se rapprocha dangereusement dans son nouveau parcours elliptique √† tel point que l'humeur des populations √† chaque approche de l'astre en f√ªt modifi√© √† son approche √† tel point que la femme se battait contre son √©poux, le fr√®re contre le fr√®re, les Nations contre les autres.. 
Puis un jour, alors que Mars se rapprochait dangereusement de la Terre, Ath√©na ou Venus (?), se servi de la Lune comme Bouclier. Le choc f√ªt terrible, et Mars f√ªt envoy√©e √† sa trajectoire actuelle.. 
Il semblerait, toujours d'apr√®s les anciens que des √©clairs gigantesques frappaient la Terre de telles sorte que les lieux o√π ces derniers s√©vissaient fondaient litt√©ralement et qu'une ville √©tat enti√®re f√ªt totalement vitrifi√© en un instant. (L√©gende de la destruction de Sodome ? ) 
Quoiqu'il en soit, depuis lors Mars devint la plan√®te de la Guerre et Venus celle de l'amour.

Where is the plasma resulting of such a massive object impacting at that speed?

It would be nice to calculate the size, the speed, inclination and mass of the object.

Covers half of the moon in 1 second
Speed: 800km/s = 0.3% velocidad de la luz

16840,bfThiqDd9FA,"You are seriously misjudging just how fast light travels.  Light travels at 299,792 km/s. The moon is 3470  km in diameter.  That means light could travel the length of 86 moons in one second. So. dust travelling 9% the speed of light would take 1 second to be the distance of 7.74 moons. Clearly that is not the case. By my guess by eyeballing this footage in 1 secondsthat gets about 1/20th the diameter of the moon, or 174 km/s ROUGHLY.  Or 0.057% the speed of light.

It's also moving at insane speed. What you'd actually see at those velocities is a blinding flash and then *slowly* rising ejecta."

17140,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest thing ever
17141,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact formed a dust cloud thats almost the size of an entire continent in just under 3 seconds and then casually disappeared
17142,bfThiqDd9FA,i dotn believe this becuase the moon isnt that big usaully..and its day unless if there looking threw a telascope also it does kinda look photo shoped to meh
17143,bfThiqDd9FA,Must been a North Korean missile test.

a plume moving at that speed would also have giant boulders and lava being thrown out from the impact. 
That impactor would have changed the moons orbit. 
But the editing was great.   We‚Äôll done."

17352,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 I can‚Äôt tell if you are being ironic or you are being serious with that
17353,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss¬† If your asking if I believe we put a man on the moon the answer is no.
17354,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 bruh
17355,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss¬† I would appeal to your  open mind to look at the work of Bart sibel. The fact it would be impossible to take pics on the moon due to the high levels of radiation let alone survive the journey through the van Allen belt. Just 2 reasons of many.
17356,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 the radiation on the moon is not harmful in short periods only in long terms and that means the moon is safe to explore also the van allen belts is also safe to pass through as long as you don‚Äôt stay in there for a long time‚Ä¶
17357,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss¬†Then whys nobody been back since? You cannot take pictures on the moon and expect them to develop so clearly. Especially on the light side. It was all faked. Have you seen Bart sibels channel? Or the work of Richard Hall? The moon rock being petrified wood?
17358,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 why nobody has been back? Cuz it wasn‚Äôt something that was going to happen but it is being talked about again also yes you can easily take pictures on the light side of the moon if it was on the dark side we couldn‚Äôt see anything at all also if it was faked then why is it you can see the American flag with a just a good telescope you need a good one like very expensive ones but you can see it up there there is no way that can be there for no reason
17359,bfThiqDd9FA,"@Jakethemoss¬† OK. It's nice to have a polite debate with someone. Show me a picture from a telescope that shows the flag. There isn't one. It's a myth. Don't you find it awfully convenient that Kennedy promised the landing before the 60s ended and it just so supposedly happened in 69? Have you look at my suggestion of the channel Bart Sibel or the documentary ""a funny thing happened on the way to the moon"" There is an interview with Nasa from not long ago where they state with not gone to the moon as we have forgotten how or don't have the technology. I was like you for decades then I did some independent research. The analysis of the astronauts interviews by Peter Hyatt is also very telling."

17407,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well, hypothetically irl, that ejecta would be expanding for hours or probably days... but it would be more of a punch bowl-shaped cone as space doesn't billow things into mushroom clouds. It would probably consist of glowing magma too as that's a HUGE impact... like probably a crater the size of Texas. This hypothetical scenario would probably be bad news for us... I assume it would be... if the moon got nudged into a more eccentric orbit or something."

17544,bfThiqDd9FA,At first I thought moon was gonna crash to Earth
17545,bfThiqDd9FA,"4 seconds to  cross moon diameter of 2000miles - so 500miles/sec  -. That is x42 faster than Chicxulub asteroid impact that wiped out dinosaurs and most of life on earth - so kinetic energy would 42^2=  147 times more (if same mass).
But that looks to be at least 25mile across (definitely not a rocket! üòÜü§£).Lets assume an asteroid  3 times size chicxulub so mass estimated = 3^3 ~9x .
  All in all impact energy =147x9 =1,323 more than a thousand times the energy than what nearly wiped out life on Earth.

Just checked numbers  -Chicxulub was 100million Megatons - so this would be 132 billion Megatonnes  - 100 Billion nuclear weapons (average size) ---all on a body with 1/80th mass and less 1/10th surface area of Earth. At least half the moon (or all of moon) surface would be re-landscaped as molten lava by this impact and much ejecta thrown onto the Earth as well causing immense havoc and endangerment to lif on Earth. Here we see instead a puff of smoke. That show's we know THIS IS FAKE."

So just an estimate, that rocket would have to be the size of about 2 of the worlds tallest building, the tallest rocket being 363 feet, it's unlikely, the sea of tranquility (on the moon) is 873km wide, reference that with the size of the object, that's where I'm getting these lower end results, in reality it might be the size of 4-5 berj Khalifa's, and the size of the cloud is more like 500 berj's, imagine something the size of the length of Florida, being hurled at the moon. SO  in short this is very false if your saying it's a rocket, if it's a huge comet, (massive) it could make similar results, the cloud may not be so big, I haven't heard anything from the telescope people or the people that constantly are surveying the moon so I'd say fake news"

17761,bfThiqDd9FA,@@parasitelights3158 Stick to your first language for your weak insults.  One or two of them might even land.  And I mean land in an actual and meaningful way.  Not the way that NASA actors ‚Äúlanded‚Äù on the moon.
17762,bfThiqDd9FA,"ok everyone, here's how it works.
1. The moon is in the visible part of the sky 12hrs a day.
2. If it's close to the sun (ie. a new moon, or sliver) the sun will be too bright (and the moon too thin) to see it until the sun is very low or has set. 
3. The moon will be VISIBLE in the daytime when it's a little way away from the sun (ie a few days after new moon until a few days before full moon). That's nearly two weeks, say 10 days.
4. You may then see the full moon rising at around sunset, but it will get dark before it gets very high.
5. For the next two weeks - this is confusing - the moon goes back from full to a sliver (old moon) but leads the sun across the sky instead of following it (with the shadow on the other side). ie it goes through full and starts rising AFTER sunset (with the shadow on the other side) and setting BEFORE sunRISE. when you'll see it for a while. In the morning. Before it sets. Over the next two weeks the moon leads the sun across the sky instead of following it, but will be visible in the day sky like before. Finally, it will become a sliver again but be visible in the day for a while AFTER sunRISE (instead of before sunset) until the sun gets too bright. Then (for the next couple of days) it goes 'past' the sun and starts again, as a new moon (see top).

Bottom line: You will see the moon during the day, at least for a while, for most of the month. You'll only see it high in the sky and for most of the day around first and last quarter. Around new and full moons, you'll only see it in the day for a couple of hours, low in the sky.

think about what you just saw."
17972,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama was kicked by Boros.. Nice..
17973,bfThiqDd9FA,"Impossible, even if something hit the moon, we wouldn't see any gas or vapor leaving our satellite until minutes plus leaving its atmosphere completely requires nuclear power/impact, the scene would be more impressive than this."

17982,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this for reel? Or it‚Äôs camera tric
17983,bfThiqDd9FA,"Saitama, is that you?"
17984,bfThiqDd9FA,??.!
17985,bfThiqDd9FA,Yawn...I had eggs for breakfast
17986,bfThiqDd9FA,It must be a asteroid or a spaceship
17987,bfThiqDd9FA,Bardock: Shit! Ginae! we overshot!
17988,bfThiqDd9FA,"Jor El: Uh, Honey.. It seem's Cal's pod has decided to take a detour..."
17989,bfThiqDd9FA,when i saw the thumbnail my first thought was *how can the moon fart*
17990,bfThiqDd9FA,like how this clip was supposedly on my birthday ü§™
17991,bfThiqDd9FA,Clearly the creator doesn‚Äôt understand the fundamental properties of the physical world. Time to study up before you trick me ü´¢
17992,bfThiqDd9FA,"amazing, it the China created moon"
17993,bfThiqDd9FA,"After reading a few comments I must say most of you guys are funny! And the main thing a comedian needs to be funny is to be is smart because stupid isn't funny, it's pitiful!  And, stupid isn't sexy either BTW! So I enjoyed the comments along with being reassured that stupid in fact is not the new normal thank God or whoever!  I am also not a bad photographer, videographer and watcher of the Moon, the Shuttle when it was in commission, our I.S.S., the Chinese space station Tiangong and our stars nightly.  I was 8 when we walked on the Moon so I've never known life without a space program. I never knew a life without the NFL either until it went gangster and the players couldn't even shut up long enough to pay homage to our fallen soldiers who gave their lives that they might play a game for a living and live comfortably well off for the rest of their lives so see what I mean? There is no virtue in stupid. And it's nice to know there are more of us than there is of them!"
17994,bfThiqDd9FA,It wouldn't produce a mushroom cloud with no atmosphere.
17995,bfThiqDd9FA,bullshit
17996,bfThiqDd9FA,The frame rate of the explosion is not the same of the rest of the video. Watch the clouds compared the the explosion.
17997,bfThiqDd9FA,time is slower in space and on the moon so it'd be a bit slower
17998,bfThiqDd9FA,It's because the moon's not that far away you have to use common sense the moon and the sun are so close it's not funny everything you've been taught is definitely a lie
17999,bfThiqDd9FA,How is the dirt flying in space like in earth? And in which side that impact occurred normal or dark side?ü§îü§îü§î
18000,bfThiqDd9FA,Horrible skill
18001,bfThiqDd9FA,A mushroom cloud? 400 miles tall and 300 miles wide? mmmmm
18002,bfThiqDd9FA,what is the black object under the moon just under the moon if you editor to zoom in you can see? and why does the debris dissipate so quick?
18003,bfThiqDd9FA,"O, woe betide the tides tonight!"
18004,bfThiqDd9FA,"You all talking about frame rates, you know ANYONE that would witness this, and just remain totally silent? Plus you'd think the news would have mentioned this. And why was someone just casually filming the moon in broad daylight?"
18005,bfThiqDd9FA,"The scale isn't quite right, but B+ for effort."
18006,bfThiqDd9FA,we never been on the moon fucken internet turned people into fucken idiots bro I swear
18007,bfThiqDd9FA,You all shut the f up with your I like the way and I love how. Just shut up
18008,bfThiqDd9FA,So why didn‚Äôt the one who filmed this react at all?
18009,bfThiqDd9FA,Irrelevant cause nothing is in the right shape. Plus idyllic birdsongs from the garden
18010,bfThiqDd9FA,I can‚Äôt believe we watched it till the end or took the time to make these comments.   We really need to get a life.
18011,bfThiqDd9FA,"That was a 3 ton rocket part striking moon at 5,800 mph‚Ä¶‚Ä¶NASA"
18012,bfThiqDd9FA,"Omg I would had never had thought this..... how did you get the moon a white as the clouds, that is some HD camera my eyes don't even see the moon as that white"
18013,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom clouds cannot exist on the moon because the moon has no atmosphere
18014,bfThiqDd9FA,I've always wondered where Puff the Magic Dragon has been.
18015,bfThiqDd9FA,"It hits the moon exactly on the edge, as seen from the observer's point of view, so we can assume its trajectory is perpendicular to it. It could be wrong but let's pretend it's right. Since It takes about twelve seconds to cover a distance that is equal to three diameters of the moon, we can assume it travels at about 900km (560ml)/sec. If it's not perpendicular to us, then it's even faster. No way. The only thing sillier than this video its me wasting my time making very rough calculations and then posting this comment. üòÇüòÇüòÇ At least, i can spare a like..."
18016,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a load of bollocks
18017,bfThiqDd9FA,How flat earthers astronomy is about
18018,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahah sure :D
18019,bfThiqDd9FA,To make this convincing you needed an accretion disc
18020,bfThiqDd9FA,"It wasn't a crash or space rock, the moon just farted"
18021,bfThiqDd9FA,ajajjaaja
18022,bfThiqDd9FA,"The crash was so powerful the smoke was laggy, clearly the simulation couldn't handle the particle effects."
18023,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO what a crock of shit. Why upload lies and BS people??? Get off the internet.
18024,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this an orb crashing into the moon? I've caught afew of them hovering and shooting off at insane super speeds

18052,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's be fair. This was a media film class project that his teacher even laughed at!!!
18053,bfThiqDd9FA,"to me, the dust cloud becomes a heart at the end--nice touch:)"
18054,bfThiqDd9FA,Why are you dredging into the moon??
18055,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how there is smoke coming from the impact
10/10 realism"
18056,bfThiqDd9FA,"I don't BELIEVE IT!!!
First of all how could this person just randomly happened to point their camera in the direction of the moon during the day at the exact moment a supposed asteroid is about hit it? Do you know how far the moon is to earth!?! Honestly, do you really think we are that dumb to think we would see dust come off the moon!?!
And remember there's no gravity in space no air so do you think it would make a mushroom shape like if a bomb hit it!?!
This camera person knows cinematography and how to do special effects.
Go make movies instead of trying to fool people with your make believe stories."
18057,bfThiqDd9FA,"The smoke made a nuclear mushroom cloud, meaning air would have to push it in order to make it. And due to no diffusion, the ploom of smoke wouldn‚Äôt have gone away."
18058,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
18059,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember this like it was yesterday.
18060,bfThiqDd9FA,Its cap

18074,bfThiqDd9FA,You know we are living in 2022 when you see the moon itself smoking weed

18081,bfThiqDd9FA,I like the way the dust cloud can billow up like that when there's no atmosphere.
18082,bfThiqDd9FA,Loving the guy just randomly recording the moon and having no reaction to an event um pretty sure would cause at least tsunamis on earth
18083,bfThiqDd9FA,So that dart project is really about something whole different. To knock planets out of orbit. The Earth for example.

18110,bfThiqDd9FA,"Jesus YouTube channels are really testing the stupidity of people with this one.

Acting like the moon is that small that the dust cloud would be seen from earth is preposterous and has zero relationship with reality.

Also the moon has very little gravity compared to earth, so that dust cloud wouldn‚Äôt even look like that."

18123,bfThiqDd9FA,"Pretty neat, but the dust cloud moved away too fast. Pay attention to the other comments too. Keep up the good work!"
18124,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just farted.. sorry it looking faketo me

18201,bfThiqDd9FA,"What happened to the moon on March 4, 2022?

A rocket part crashed on the moon, as predicted, at around 7:25 a.m. EST on March 4, 2022. It smashed into the far side of the moon ‚Äî where lunar orbiters were not able to observe the event ‚Äî in the Hertzsprung crater, which is 350 miles wide. Humans weren't able to observe it from Earth, but the collision created a plume of dust that possibly lingered for hours."

18209,bfThiqDd9FA,I know some days we can still see the moon during the day. But  Why is the moon still so large and clearly  visible on a bright sunny day?
18210,bfThiqDd9FA,Cause the sun shines on the moon too so it's just as bright as anything else the sun is shining on

18394,bfThiqDd9FA,The impact cloud is like 1/10 the size of the entire moon and the object is like 1/100th of the size of the moon. Wouldn‚Äôt an impact that large cause noticeable damage to the moon?
18395,bfThiqDd9FA,Went strait thru.
18396,bfThiqDd9FA,No because the moon is made of green cheese which is quite forgiving.

18406,bfThiqDd9FA,If that happend if it was a nuke by moon and we wouldn‚Äôt be living anymore

18421,bfThiqDd9FA,This is clearly BS. 1: anything that bright during the day would be hundreds of kilometers across and would be picked up and tracked by every astronomer and observatory weeks before it ever got close. And 2: impacts of that size do not happen that quickly. I know this because I am an astronomer and whoever concocted this rubbish is doing a major disservice to the public.

18668,bfThiqDd9FA,Why moon is moving
18669,bfThiqDd9FA,At least try to get the FPS correct when making these. Also something that large travelling that fast would cause a lot more damage than that. Also note that the dust cloud is being held in shape by air pressure and gravity. On the moon.
18670,bfThiqDd9FA,If this would have been true then then the speed of the object crashing would be definitely in some millions of kms per hour
18671,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud went way to high to fast. Its always the little things.

18797,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's very simple. As the moon's core cooled, the Earth's gravity pulled the magma in the core towards it, meaning the hemisphere that faces us is more dense than the farther half. Therefore the moon is ""geolocked"" with one side always facing Earth's gravity."

18814,bfThiqDd9FA,There'd be a tremendous flash of light first... and no mushroom clouds either since there is no air and without air there's no variation in pressures that contribute to the formation of a mushroom cloud.
18815,bfThiqDd9FA,Okay lets just explain  everything  wrong   here. First  off.  the size of  the moon is ridiculous. The  speed  of the asteroid  is even more ridiculous and  the fact that you can see it. The thing  is I am pretty sure  light  doesn't  go from moon to earth  in an instant. Moon doesn't  have strong enough atmosphere  for the mushroom cloud. Instead  it would have been round shaped  explosion of dust. And explosion  itself  was too fast. In summary If this object hit moon at this speed  I am not sure  if moon would even be still there...

18951,bfThiqDd9FA,@@pandorasactor7127 the moon is actually in a region of earths atmosphere called the geocorona. This stretches well past the moon and forms part of earths atmosphere as the outer layer that protect us against solar flares etc.
18952,bfThiqDd9FA,@@douglonmaduna7270 It is technically sometimes inside Earth's atmosphere (exosphere) but obviously the density is completely negligible.

18960,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Shendrift Yeah why on moon is the dust descending into a mushroom cloud like that? Gravity is allegedly so low on the moon that the dust would be free to displace much more erratically, and less constrained, than the shape of a clear mushroom shape."

18962,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Georgeconna32 and for us to see that big thing hit really?? How do you calculate that speed? I'm sure your years at MIT can explain it. No moon dust hit your car. But I like how you got people to reply
18963,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@douglonmaduna7270 there are very minimal gases in the outermost fields, and it is not that which protects us from the sun and its radiation but it is the electromagnetic field produced by the earth"
18964,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 There's always one guy that stretches to explain how the ridiculous looking thing is actually correct.
18965,bfThiqDd9FA,"Somebody clearly doesn‚Äôt understand that there are no convection lines on the moon, because there isn‚Äôt any air pressure due to the lack of an atmosphere and magnetic field.

Also if such a large object collided with the moon at that speed, the moon would be a lava world."
18966,bfThiqDd9FA,@@theakiwar9118 So basically it wouldn't mushroom at that speed.
18967,bfThiqDd9FA,@@tonywells6990 lmao bro forgot what sarcasm was
18968,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sebastianusami lmao r/woosh
18969,bfThiqDd9FA,"Exactly.. If you consider the diameter of the moon, the cloud traveled about 500mi in one second.üòÇüòÇ even with no atmosphere and little gravity that is ridiculous."
18970,bfThiqDd9FA,UNDERSTAND!!!!!! The moon HAS an atmosphere!!!!!!
18971,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@GilbertGarcia_ojoartstudios no shit Sherlock a nuke is a complex chain reaction, of course the air pressure and earth debris will take longer to form a mushroom cloud"
18972,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 r/youngpeopleyoutube
18973,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sebastianusami that thing is traveling FAR faster than the speed of a rocket.
18974,bfThiqDd9FA,@@themagicminstrels476 never said it wasnt
18975,bfThiqDd9FA,"No the dust cloud is consistent with the math. Eyeballing that thing it'd be somewhere in the vicinity of 170ish km/s (1/20th moon diameter in one second). As theres no atmosphere, there isn't any drag to slow it down so things are just gonna go flying."
18976,bfThiqDd9FA,How many times have you been nuked?
18977,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@stolearovigor281 genuine question here for yourself, why don't you or the flat earth community build a rocket that can take a camera up to space ( without fish eye lens ) and see for yourself if it's really flat or not?"

18979,bfThiqDd9FA,A nuke isn't going to mushroom on the moon either.

18985,bfThiqDd9FA,@@douglonmaduna7270 Barely. Its on the cusp so to expect the impact to be the same as on earth isn't realistic
18986,bfThiqDd9FA,Well genius. Comets and Asteroids move much faster than any nuke.
18987,bfThiqDd9FA,Because it‚Äôs on the moon
18988,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@boratesic5941 the moon aint got no atmosphere, do your research properly before trying to correct someone"
18989,bfThiqDd9FA,yeah but the video is 40 seconds long so.....
18990,bfThiqDd9FA,the moons gravity and magnetic forces would probably have the effect of 'mushrooming' the particles. but it just seems to happen so fast. but if it did happen that fast then alot of energy would release that amount of surface material. at an angle that material would get ejected so high and with such velocity some would start to possibly orbit the moon for a while. possibly creating a temportary ring of ejecta around the moon

19101,bfThiqDd9FA,"Indeed your beginning statement is incorrect, but your immediate instinct to realize the vacuum of space might negate sound, was spot on.

Sound travels through air on our planet, which is made up of multiple gasses. Without those gasses (vacuum), there would be nothing for the pressure to react against to produce sound waves."

19546,bfThiqDd9FA,haha
19547,bfThiqDd9FA,It's my birthday day
19548,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is too big and too bright. Plus, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see an object that small headed towards the moon. Also, the mere fact of the man randomly recording the moon is a proof in itself that this is faked as all hell."

19553,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama???
19554,bfThiqDd9FA,Did moon move after hit?
19555,bfThiqDd9FA,There are no mushroom clouds in space

19558,bfThiqDd9FA,All of this in the day time that rocket had to be big as Central Park
19559,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
19560,bfThiqDd9FA,That big a rock ( most likely the size of a small country ) would have been catastrophic for life here. It would have moved the moons Orbit effecting tides and gravity here.
19561,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow nice editing
19562,bfThiqDd9FA,Full size nuclear type explosion on the moon with fuk all gravity and there's no impact blast going around the rock. What brainyack came up with this idea.
19563,bfThiqDd9FA,it would be better if the moon was smaller and the explosion didnt seem like it had air and was at 5 fps
19564,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is much less gravity on the moon and  atmosphere, would it still make a mushroom shape??"
19565,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the framerate of the collision didn't match the framerate of the video. Who's gullible enough to fall for this?
19566,bfThiqDd9FA,ye kya hua tha
19567,bfThiqDd9FA,Totally believable...
19568,bfThiqDd9FA,It‚Äôs just a coincidence.  A shooting star passed by right as the moon was farting.
19569,bfThiqDd9FA,its just a jet hitting hyper sonic  speed  lined up in from of the moon camera shot..

19576,bfThiqDd9FA,Possible small cloud formation in Earth atmosphere.
19577,bfThiqDd9FA,If anyone thought this was a asteroid it was actually a out of control Chinese space rocket. If you search up March 4th 2022 on YouTube you probably see a out of control Chinese space rocket colliding with the moon + idk anything else
19578,bfThiqDd9FA,What happens to the space dust does float to earth or will the moons small amount of gravity eventually pull it back?
19579,bfThiqDd9FA,Tell me the owner of the video.I need him to send me to the moon through his editing expertise.

19583,bfThiqDd9FA,On March 3 is was my friend birthday
19584,bfThiqDd9FA,"I calculate that rock to be traveling at 800km/s with a diameter of about 10 miles. Aside from the fact that that speed is impossible for an object orbiting the sun. The impact measures 1.28x10^11 megatons. Or 5.36x10^23 joules.

That‚Äôs 1280x the power of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.

You need a way bigger plume. 

The crater is gunna be about the size of the large black circle in the upper half of the moon. About 500km wide.

Would love to see a version with accurate impact ejecta."

19663,bfThiqDd9FA,I turned 31 that day
19664,bfThiqDd9FA,"whoever did this has absolutely no idea. i have a few questions.
how big is the object that hits? it must be huge to see it from earth....
how fast is it? it looks like the speed of a passenger plane, but normally it would be faster as the space station flies. and it's so fast you can hardly see it with the naked eye. 
and what kind of smoke cloud is that? is there an atmosphere on the moon? no, so there's no cloud formation either. and the cloud jumps.......

on a scale of 1 to 10 for credibility, i give it a 0."
19665,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how the frame rate of the mushroom cloud is different than the clouds going by! I didn't know cameras could do that..
19666,bfThiqDd9FA,Not sure but I think you would need oxygen for fire and moon or that thing doesn't seem to carry it? Meteors burn when they crash onto earth due to entering ozone and we have oxygen here so it burns with the friction. Not entirely sure if thats the reason why theres no fire in the vid but thats my guess
19667,bfThiqDd9FA,the frame rate is off to.. account for distanceüóø
19668,bfThiqDd9FA,Well now you know.üòÅ

19692,bfThiqDd9FA,That‚Äôs no moon.
19693,bfThiqDd9FA,"Shouldn't the fact that the moon is devoid of atmosphere be considered? And yet, the impact plume's visible characteristics behave as an impact plume on earth would take place, a cohesive mushroom form, losing velocity with time and distance, due to gravity and atmosphere. I agree that the moon does have a gravity field, which would slow the dispersion of the debris. The debris would not remain intact, it would continue to disperse due to the lack of atmosphere....

19704,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest crap ever

19768,bfThiqDd9FA,"""A rocket part that's been careering around space"""
19769,bfThiqDd9FA,It would be cool if they made the moon deflate like a popped balloon and fall to earth as a deflated bag.

19777,bfThiqDd9FA,"Actually no. The light from the asteroid takes the same amount of time to get to Earth as the Moon, so they're would be no discrepancy in how fast we see the explosion."
19778,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@TheSpacePlaceYT wrong, please correct yourself with proper research. Its a common sense even kids know it. Even in earth, far places explosions looks like they are standing still"
19779,bfThiqDd9FA,I feel like the cloud of smoke should not have disappeared so fast....
19780,bfThiqDd9FA,What matter of fuckery is this?

19785,bfThiqDd9FA,"Where does the Earth‚Äôs spinning atmosphere stop, and the vacuum of space begin? At the Karman Line? Between the Exosphere and Thermosphere?
Not all scientists agree that the exosphere is really a part of the atmosphere. Some scientists consider the thermosphere the uppermost part of Earth's atmosphere, and think that the exosphere is really just part of space. However, other scientists do consider the exosphere part of our planet's atmosphere.
How is the atmosphere, which is a gas, and the Earth which is a solid, and the water, which is a liquid, all moving at the same speed as one body? And if the atmosphere is a gas, how is it different from other gases like wind from hurricanes or simple directional breezes? Inertia is the term that describes why we don‚Äôt sense the movement. But using the train or plane analogy, we must take into account the physical barrier, steel, aluminum, glass, etc...that prevents the resistance force to be felt. Roll down the window of your car and those forces will be felt. That leads to my question: at what point in the upper atmosphere does this invisible protective barrier exist? The exosphere or thermosphere or the K√°rm√°n line."
19786,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah nah
19787,bfThiqDd9FA,Palsu

19789,bfThiqDd9FA,An official statement from the moon: I known as the moon to millions of you earthling and home to thousand and thousands traveling aliens who zipping across my celestial well adored body and by human on earth that I am very upset and miffed that you decided to poke a hole in me with a rocket and cause a scar on my round curvy body. Wasn‚Äôt exploding bomb many years ago to find out if I ring like a bell enough? Now this!? And you expect me to house you and keep you for the upcoming colonization of my soil to get to Mars?

19828,bfThiqDd9FA,Whole time the just tried to nuke the moonü™¨
19829,bfThiqDd9FA,This is very wrong not only because of the distance and the size of the rock but because the shape of the dust makes a mushroom cloud there's a negligible amount of atmospheric pressure on the moon to none which would not make the dust form a inverted cone instead of a mushroom cloud.
19830,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit I‚Äôve ever seen!!

19836,bfThiqDd9FA,Why I'm wasting my time even looking at this s***
19837,bfThiqDd9FA,üòÇ
19838,bfThiqDd9FA,"First let's use some physics based logic.
The moon is about a 3rd of our size.
That impact to be seen so easily and to reach that hight would be around the size of a damn small country. The blast cloud was easily over 100miles in hight.

We would have felt the impact here in earth.
The moon is only 250,000 miles away.
Just miles .

A blast with that much concussive force would have surely been felt by our planet.

Think about it.
The moon effects our gravity ,our oceans ,our weather.

So a massive heavy explosion with such force would have an impact on our planet ."
19839,bfThiqDd9FA,"Person decided to record the moon moments before, that‚Äôs no coincidence"
19840,bfThiqDd9FA,That fart so big
19841,bfThiqDd9FA,Yall know this didn't happen like this right? Please don't fall for idiocy like this.

19893,bfThiqDd9FA,Hey guys look this up because it's true they knew this was going to happen late last year this is probably a scientist they were well aware when it was going to happen they knew it was going to happen on March 4th so they set up a camera to watch it look up the article this wasn't staged
19894,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how this guy decided to film the moon during the day and just happened to capture this

But every country on earth lies to their people. We will never no the truth!"
19902,bfThiqDd9FA,So this person just so happens to be recording the moon right when this happened?

19904,bfThiqDd9FA,"They say it was a Chinese rocket, but don't know if it's the truth or not"

19982,bfThiqDd9FA,Dang I didn‚Äôt know the rocket brought a lunar atmosphere as a payload with that explosion. Impressive that just a tiny rocket can bring an entire atmosphere for a mushroom cloud to form!

20010,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom clouds only look the way they do because of atmospheric pressure and heat force the dust and smoke upwards. In vacuum it would not look like this.

20104,bfThiqDd9FA,Why was this person videoing the moon in the first place kinda susp to me
20105,bfThiqDd9FA,How are we seeing this and the moon is millions of miles away?
20106,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't believe the hype. They'll do anything to distract you from what's really going on.

20109,bfThiqDd9FA,Fact or cAppp
20110,bfThiqDd9FA,It  killed cats on the darkside
20111,bfThiqDd9FA,"so, really rough math, but the cloud is about 1/4.5 of the moon in this. the moon's diameter is 2159 miles. this means that the cloud is about 480 miles tall... 2,500,000 feet. now, without near as much gravity? I still doubt the shit out of this. the news would have been all fuckin over this. bullshit."

20206,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud expand faster then speed of light. üòÇ
20207,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's pretty funny, but the directional lighting is a bit off. Also, the size, shape, and speed of the dust cloud doesn't make any sense for the scale. Making it slower, darker, smaller, and introducing a slight shockwave would add a bit of believability. Of course the frame rate is weird, but that's easily fixed in the render. I don't know how I feel about the ""rocket"" approach. The physics of this just imply that the moon is tiny and floating within Earth's atmosphere. It is funny, I'll give ya that. I am just always very much more impressed by realism and scale. Even just making the moon spin a bit or start glowing a tiny amount starting at the impact site and slowing rolling across would have that little extra ""oomph"" to get the point across."

20298,bfThiqDd9FA,I found a lump of cheese the size of a house brick in my garden on the 23 March 2022 it must be from that collision. If anyone is interested the moon must be made from gorgonzola as the lump in my garden was definitely gorgonzola.

20324,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you could really see a cloud of smoke or debris after a tiny rocket hit the moon with that detail, we would be used to it. That is impossible to see with the naked eye. Look at planes you can barely see the ones flying at commercial heights. The moon is 200,000 some odd miles away without checking. That would be orbit altering scale of impact. I'm not a scientist. But I've looked up at the moon for 33 years and never seen anything close to that size anything in the sky. So back to the distance the Moon is away from us, that ""rocket"" would have to be traveling 80,000 MPS Miles Per Second."

If the moon is about 2000 miles wide, it would take  about one minute to cover the moon's diameter, and the cloud would take many seconds to reach what you show in a couple seconds. I know the public's goldfish attention span wouldn't allow these ""long"" time periods. Otherwise it's great."

20584,bfThiqDd9FA,I have no idea how this works but from what I understand the size of the rocket to be seen like this in this video would require it to be at least 120 kilometers in width and height
20585,bfThiqDd9FA,Or the moon would have to be very very close.
20586,bfThiqDd9FA,this is the fakest thing i have ever seen

20602,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon and the sun aren't that far away.  Nowhere near the numbers they give us üòí.....
20603,bfThiqDd9FA,Judging by the size of the object it must have been hundreds of miles or kilometers wide to be seen from Earth and such a small plume. Odd. Why bother.
20604,bfThiqDd9FA,What bollocks.
20605,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahaha... Funny
20606,bfThiqDd9FA,What's just happening?
20607,bfThiqDd9FA,Fake.  The noise from that would have been so loud!  If that was real.  Plus the shockwave would have killed the person with the camera.  That was basically a nuclear bomb.  You wouldn‚Äôt be able to just stand there and film it.
20608,bfThiqDd9FA,Clouds moving in back of the moon is a sign the moon is coming closer to the Earth's core
20609,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm glad you noticed the local clouds but the moon is local too. Not moving closer. And even if it were moving closer...NASA free mason satanists tell us the moon is 238k miles away. If it were you wouldn't see our clouds behind it from that far.
20610,bfThiqDd9FA,Unlike and move on
20611,bfThiqDd9FA,"The speed at which the ""cloud of dust"" formulates, expands & disappears is WAY TOO FAST.  It would have to be slowed down by at least 5 times and maybe more for it to appear realistic."

20664,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@maxxcon170 You can see an asteroid all the way out to Jupiter? I think you mean a comet. A 'shooting star' is usually a streak of light across the night sky that can be see from Earth, so there's no way you'll be able to see an asteroid or comet all the way out at Jupiter's orbit unless you happen to actually be on Jupiter.

A small meteor falling into Earth's atmosphere or a comet flying close to Earth within the inner solar system would be shooting stars, because those are the only 'streaks of light' close enough for us to see with the naked eye and even then comets, which are actually further away than the moon, will be seen in the night sky for days.  They travel fast in space, but in the night sky on Earth it appears very slow.

If you saw something travelling faster than the meteor in this video, it was only space debri falling into Earth's atmosphere. Soulreed is correct."

20807,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@MoreDeiftwaser If it isn't obvious to you that the video is 100% human-created using 
software, then you are a bit of a fool (sorry, but I think it's probably true).
There are several strong hints: think about scale. How big is the moon (1/4 size of earth), how far away is it (about 384,000 kilometres), and so how big would the ""space craft"" have to be in order to be visible from earth - in BROAD DAYLIGHT??? How big would the plume of dust be, and how quickly would it arise from the surface?
NOTHING ADDS UP, unless you decide not to think about adding things up.
Read some of the other comments from people who pointed out other ways in which it is obviously a faked video.
Also, read this: https://www.youtube.com/c/ViralVideoLab/about and see what you think after reading it.
It's faked video from a highly dishonest person or company who is GROSSLY misrepresenting reality and NOT really entertaining anybody in a good and decent way."

20812,bfThiqDd9FA,Always do your homework

21020,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ThorsDecree you didnt do the math
21021,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@petterlarsson7257 angular size of the moon is .52¬∞ on average when viewed from earth. Diameter of 3500km. The ""explosion"" gained an altitude of about 1000km in about one frame, assuming 30fps that's 003s. So 100000km/s.

Light is 300000km/s. So the impactor would be moving at relativistic speed of about .3-.4c.

I did indeed do the math. It literally takes seconds if you have an approximate idea of the numbers. I'm sorry math is hard for you, but that doesn't mean other people don't casually calculate things all the time.

I had assumed angular size of 1¬∞ and diameter of 5000km before looking it up so yes that works out to an explosion happening faster than light.

Take your ignorance to a library, they know how to help you with that."
21022,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@petterlarsson7257 and all that assumes the impact wasnt at an oblique angle, which would cause the actual result to be higher than the calculated one since I'm assuming an impactor trajectory perpendicular to the camera angle.

21626,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon is traveling alongside the earth through an orbital path around the sun at tens of thousands of miles per hour and is also traveling around the earth at a similar speed then the moon is traveling through space twice as fast as it is traveling around/in relation to the earth because it needs to 'keep up' with the earth going around the sun as well as to also travel in respect of the earth at tens of thousands of miles per hour in order to be able to orbit the earth and this 'doubling up' of the velocity of the moon traveling through space should send the moon 'flying off course' at tens of thousands of miles per hour as it passes around the earth?
21627,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactly.. if the moon were to take such an impact.. it could only be on the side that‚Äôs flying towards the earth.. as you know.. gravity and orbits work because items will fall into each other but miss each other.. So the moon couldn‚Äôt be hit from something traveling behind it? It would have to be going faster than the moon towards earth. Nice effects though.
21628,bfThiqDd9FA,"The gravity of the earth keeps the moon rotating around it in a localised gravity well, just as the earth rotates around the sun. Did you know the sun rotates around the centre of the galaxy too? and yet the earth doesn't spin off into the distance. It's almost like supermassive celestial bodies exert a force that causes space time to bend, and objects rotating around the object to slowly fall in toward the object they are rotating around (or slowly move away, depending on their own velocity relative to the partnered objects.)"

The momentum is 'slowing down'/'accelerating in a different direction(s) as the MOON travels in an elongated 'parabolic arc' in relation to the fast-travelling EARTH that creates the 'illusion' of the MOON simply passing through a circling route in relation to the EARTH, always both keeping the same distance and the same momentum/'angular momentum'?  However, how can the change in direction of the MOON in relation to the EARTH which is not stationary not entail a 'yo-yo-ing'/'fluctuating' increase and decrease in momentum of the MOON as it travels forwards and turns in an 'elongated arc' through space and then turns to go around the EARTH in the direction 'ACROSS the path of' and then opposite to the EARTH'S direction of travel?

As the MOON 'accelerates' in a direction that 'crosses the path' of the EARTH its momentum 'passing the EARTH' is greater   which should result in the MOON 'flying away' off course from its circular path around the EARTH?  Just as there is no yo-yo string between the MOON and the EARTH providing the centripetal force required to repeatedly 'accelerate'/change the direction of the MOON in relation to the EARTH there is also no balanced force pushing/pulling the MOON around the EARTH and no explanation for the repeated loss of momentum of the MOON as it passes 'across and backwards' in relation to the path of travel of the EARTH around the SUN?

21785,bfThiqDd9FA,@@marked4death076 Most likely larger than the one that wiped out the Dinos. There would be a brand new crater on the moon and there would also be debris rays across half the moon.

Lets give the benefit of the doubt, and say it was early in the morning, sometimes you can see the moon at that time. 

How would a ""rocket"" be visible? Usually even the iss isnt visible in the daytime.

Not to mention the dust cloud, im not an expert, hell im still in school, but due to it being in space, and the fact that the moon barely has any gravity, id guess that if an impact does generate dust, it would still be visible for a long time.

Idk if it works like this so please tell me if im wrong, but i would imagine that some of the dust would just go flying forever into space."

21816,bfThiqDd9FA,Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself
21817,bfThiqDd9FA,Agreed.
21818,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@marked4death076 The moon‚Äôs diameter here is about 25 times the diameter of the moving object. I will also assume it hits the exact side of the moon, which means the center of the moon and the center of this object are as far away from each other. So, since the moon is 2,159.1 mi, I estimate this object is 86.36 mi in diameter. Absolutely massive rocket‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs amazing the progress we‚Äôve made in such a short amount of time, considering the rocket used for Apollo missions was only 364 ft, while just a stray part of this rocket is x1300 the size.

Also note that the rocket stays the same size throughout the whole video, which means it‚Äôs at a constant distance from the observer, which means it‚Äôs orbiting exactly along the moon‚Äôs orbital path. My guess is someone at NASA accidentally set the rocket‚Äôs orbital path to be the moon‚Äôs orbital path‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an easy typo to make. However, we should not let this blunder blind us from the advancements in technology showcased in this small clip. The cloaking devices, set to activate only when the rocket is behind a cloud relative to the observer, functioned pristinely‚Ä¶ The fact that the rocket cannot be seen from behind even a mostly translucent cloud as featured in the video speaks wonders to the state of the technology."

The further away from the earth an object is in orbit, the slower it is. The object hit the moon exactly at its edge meaning it‚Äôs also in orbit with the earth in the exact same orbit as the moon. This means that 900km/s is impossible because at that orbit, an object will move closer to 1km/s. Hope this helps :)"

21977,bfThiqDd9FA,"The Holy Spirit is always in one female person on earth at a time. That person is essentially the ark of the covenant. In this time this person is trying to help and give Gods truth but all she gets is abuse from everyone because they have believed lies by Satan they are not opened to Gods truth. Abuse is of Satan and when everyone is abusing his ark his spirit what do you think happens? It comes back on you in your life. If your life seems to be be blessed then you have been given salvation and she is happy with you. But if things in your life are not then you either start fixing how you do say feel and think in a more positive way.

The Holy Spirit the 3rd of the Trinity is The Bride of Christ, The Queen of Heaven and Earth, The Queen of Sheba, The Queen of the South,Luisa, Isis, Israel, Daughter Zion, Wisdom, Mary Magdalene is the living Ark of the Covenant as The Mona Lisa the 2nd.

Truth in plain sight! Leonardo DaVinci Paintings

ü¶ÅIf you calculate this year 2022 minus the year the 1st Mona Lisa died 1542=480 years, the same amount of time from Exodus to the rebuild of the new temple in the Bible. The 2nd Mona Lisa is the Bride of Christ, Queen of Heaven, Ephraim The living spirit of God on earth now - The Mona Lisa 2nd 

The second coming has already begun so When she crosses you path with nature‚Äôs help your up for judgement. Judgement of how you lived your life in this lifetime. You‚Äôll either receive eternal salvation or eternal damnation. So I‚Äôd be thinking my words and thoughts carefully because you don‚Äôt know who she is.
Her new rules going forward will not tolerate negativity and God will continue to give you tests for issues you need to resolve. You either go with evolution or perish. 

Earths new rules Were sent by Christ and follow in the same footsteps-WE ALL need to be active in being helpful kind compassionate forgiving unified equality joyful sing&dance thoughtful peaceful empathy worship each other and love in all aspects of our lives. We should be acting feeling thinking breathing speaking in our heart and soul. 
Walk the walk talk the talk like CHRIST did. It‚Äôs that simple. Killing or hurting any of her divine children is not allowed. üö´

I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit The Bride will not be forgiven
The Elect were given one year with her after she awoken to her true self. This year June 13th 2022 marks ONE year. The 14th also lined up with a planetary alignment. Time is up"

22493,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 and what is the point of lying about the moons position and size? Nothing, lying about the moon doesnt do a single thing. The moon is not in our atmosphere. If the moon is in our atmosphere, it would crash into the earth due to earths gravity, and if it doesnt crash? It would make waves as big as a tsunami normal"
22494,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 not if it's small it wouldn't.  
They want you to believe in anything ot h er then our creator.  Yahuah"
22495,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 im not gonna be arguing about religion for now, you havent answered the question

What good, does lying about the moon do. Does lying about the moons position give you power? Does lying about the moons size give you control? What does it do, what good does it bring to the one who lies, for them to even lie about the moon"
22496,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 even a satelite, which is VERY tiny, falls due to the atmosphere, HECK EVEN WATER AND DUST FALL, Why would the moon, even if lets say its 1p0 times less the size of what people teach you rn, not fall due to the atmosphere?"
22497,bfThiqDd9FA,It's plazma
22498,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 
1. Which part are you referring to as plasma? 
2. Havent answered my question"
22499,bfThiqDd9FA,@@mohy3396 the moon is plasma. Its not a rock.
22500,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 
The moon is not plasma, you can see this by the fact that it has a shadow, plasma is basically fire, the sun, lightbulbs, etc, you can see that your lightbulb does not have a shadow when it is turned on, you can also see that when two lightbulbs are near eachother, it doesnt cast a shadow on one another even if theres a small pencil in between. 

Therefore if the moon is plasma, it would be VERY HOT,  as bright as the sun, and doesnt have a shadow.

Lets recap your theories, that the moon is small and in our atmosphere, what problems would occur if this is true?
1. The moon would fall due to earths gravity since it is in our atmosphere
2. If it didnt fall, the moon would make waves as big as tsunamis more normal

Your counter to this was that the moon is made out of plasma. Lets see what occurs if this is true.
1. Night time would not exist due to every part of the earth being lit up by both the sun and the moon
2. The earth would be flaming hot due to the moon being a second sun and in our atmosphere
3. Water would cease to exists due to the moon being flaming hot and in our atmosphere
4. Plasma has mass, and what has mass will always be affected by gravity, therefore the moon will still fall due to it being in the atmosphere of the earth
5. If the moon was plasma, a rocket would disintegrate when making contact, it wouldnt generate dust"
22501,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes it is plasma.
22502,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 also, you still havent answered my first question"
22503,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 then give some evidence that it is plasma... god, whoever you believe in, gave you a brain to think, ears to listen, and eyes to see. Please use them"
22504,bfThiqDd9FA,What ever. Still plasma
22505,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 give me proof that it is plasma
22506,bfThiqDd9FA,Go on utube and text the moon is plasma
22507,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 ¬† the only video talking about the moon being plasma, is a sketchy ""scientist"" from 1965 who doesnt have any other work or is even mentioned anyywhere else. 

The man only says theories and concepts, he said and i quote ""the accumulated evidence is so much on my favor"" yet he does not speak of what those evidences are. 

He claims that he has made predictions that is in 1958, and that it was confirmed, yet he does not speak of what those predictions are and who confirmed them.

He also claims that he has published a manuscript in 1954 and that its validity was reviewed by australia and that in 1964 was confirmed when princeton stated that the principles of time reversal invariance were invalid, yet i tried multiple times trying to find this manuscript which didnt show up anywhere.

The princeton article in 1964 which talks about time reversal invariance is in fact true but in the article it says ""It is possible, the group conceded, that the data may be interpreted to mean something other than that time reversal invariance is not always followed. But this possibility is held to be extremely remote"" which suggests possibility of one of the principles of time reversal invariance, which is the decay of mesons to be invalid, but at a very low chance."
22508,bfThiqDd9FA,That's the way it always is when truth gets covered up. They don't want you to know. They keep it a theory for that reason. When government and eleit hids things is going to be kept a theory.
22509,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you also cant prove the theory by this ""scientist"" 

the guy described himself with ""i was considered a lunatic"" which in australia means that he have been in a mental hospital

+ Have you not read what i said? The moon has shadows and craters, Plasma cannot have both of those, hence why the sun doesnt have a shadow or craters. Go out of your house and see for yourself that the moon has a shadow."
22510,bfThiqDd9FA,The more truth you know the more that they try to make you look like a lunatic.
22511,bfThiqDd9FA,"Just for argument sake . Say the moon is 100 percent plasma . The elites and government don't want it to be leaked out.
Do you really think they would let someone tell the truth about it.
A man some years back produced a carburetor that would get 100 miles a gallon.  They destroyed the patent and the knowledge of it and the man wound up dead. If they don't want something known it won't be."
22512,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 lets go with the moon = 100% plasma
AS I SAID BEFORE PLASMA IS VERY HOT AND LUMINOUS, add your argument that the moon is in the earths atmosphere, the moon would fry us alive by now, and NIGHT TIME WOULD NOT HAPPEN"
22513,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 Never argue with an idiot. You‚Äôll never convince the idiot that you‚Äôre correct, and bystanders won‚Äôt be able to tell who‚Äôs who.
;)"
22514,bfThiqDd9FA,Their is such thing as cool plasma.
22515,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 thing is, cold plasma is still bright, meaning the problem is still there

 night time will not exist"
22516,bfThiqDd9FA,"Science don't know everything bud.
They don't know all about plasma neither do you. Our father created it. He knows way more then anyone."
22517,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like plasma dust to me.
22518,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you also dont know everything about the world either.

Not that you would even try to read everything, since last time you didnt read and just said the same thing as before ""whatever still plasma"" but let me tell you things about plasma dust, a very good example of plasma dust, are comets. And comets glow, if the moon itself was dusty non-thermal plasma, it would still glow, which would then still have the problem of night time not existing.

Now then, i noticed another thing, you believe that the rocket did in fact crash into the moon, and that a dust cloud generated. First of all, if the moon was nonthermal plasma, due to the gravity i would imagine that the rocket would only be broken inside of the moon due to pressure, if that is the case, then a dust cloud wouldnt occur. 

Plasma, is not solid, it cannot be picked up, cannot be touched, the ""rocket"" in the video therefore it would not crash on the surface of the moon, as i said before, it would disintegrate due to high heat, but you shut that down by saying the moon is nonthermal plasma, still, it wouldnt crash on the surface, therefore it wouldnt generate dust.

Funny thing is how the ""scientist"" that you told me to listen to, believes that the moon is hot plasma, he even stated that a rocket would disintegrate due to the heat.

And i see how youre running out of ideas, you stopped trying to explain the problems i suggested, and blaming science doesnt know everything, only god does. But you do not know everything that god knows, same with me, same with everyone.

Science is filled with complex things, but it all comes down to very basic rules, that can be applied to everything. And you are trying very hard to say that those basic rules, are false. Which by all means is possible, but very unlikely."
22519,bfThiqDd9FA,"All I know is that the word is true . Every bit of it. Science tries really hard to disprove it even to the point of lying.
A lot of that they do.  
These moon and stars was created on the forth day . Earth is flat and inclosed system."

22528,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 well ‚Äúthey‚Äù aren‚Äôt going to have to put much effort into that with you buddy.  You show no proof just cite youtube videos, where literally anyone can post.  No vetting. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù figure were smart enough to spot the bullshit and ignore it but they forget there are people like yourself who will believe anything they hear that‚Äôs out of left field in order to make themselves feel like they know some secret that everyone else doesn‚Äôt. .  To think that of all the geniuses and great minds that have worked on planetary sconce over the centuries, that you and a few other conspiracy nuts hold the truth?  Really?  It‚Äôs really an extension of narcissism if you think about it.
So explain this Mr Wizard‚Ä¶ hundreds of thousands of people worked on the moon landings which couldn‚Äôt have occurred if the moon were made of ‚Äúplasma‚Äù as you say.  12 men actually walked on it. It‚Äôs been 53 years since this happened.  And you‚Äôre actually suggesting that of those thousands of people, NOT ONE OF THEM decided the beans should be spilled?  NOT ONE got hard up, needed the money, and did a book deal?  NOT ONE just wanted their 15 min of fame and told the world?   In 1997 the Potus got a bj in the Oval Office and only 2 people knew.  Within 6 months the whole country knew. Yet you‚Äôre suggesting that in 53 years thousands of people have banded together, ignoring all these situations I mentioned, and kept a secret for no reason?  Yeah that‚Äôs plausible.  Please grab your tinfoil hat and go back to mommy‚Äôs basement, and let the adults talk."
22529,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you don‚Äôt even know how to use the language correctly, but you seem to think we should ignore empirical data and listen to you.  Science doesn‚Äôt know everything but unlike yourself, it uses actual data and facts to demonstrate the validity of what it does know and no, that isn‚Äôt all based on YouTube videos."
22530,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ebeckman1011 yeah and every time it has been debunked they delete it from view
22531,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 god who ties your shoes in the morning?   You have no proof whatsoever other that a few conspiracy theorist YouTube videos.  Meanwhile there are moon rocks, people who went there, scientific data, but by all means cling to these ‚Äúexpert videos‚Äù.  I noticed you completely ignored what I said about there being no way to keep all these people quiet. That‚Äôs the funny thing about these narcissistic conspiracy toting shit shows, any time you hit them with facts or logic they change the subject or talk about one aspect, while completely ignoring the mountain of evidence.  It must be so lonely in that basement with all your tin foil gadgets. I guess that‚Äôs why you answered a thread from a month ago in like 20 min"

22574,bfThiqDd9FA,Area
22575,bfThiqDd9FA,"I‚Äôm not sure you would see much of anything regardless of the size of this impact. It would reflect the suns light much less than the solid moons surface that‚Äôs for sure, and would appear opaque to a degree. It would disperse very very slowly, and form much more slowly. It also unless centered in a deep canyons or steep crater would have a ploom originating from the site of impact, which we don‚Äôt see here. It‚Äôs offset by a pretty vast distance down the moons circumference. Very rookie mistake there. 

And Finally, I doubt you would see shading within the ploom, again because it would be so faint, and so slow to form the shape needed. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt be on par with the gradient contrasts seen in the moons craters like it is here. And the overall ploom itself would not correlate to what we see on earth based impacts and explosions. Remember the gravity it much different, the atmosphere almost non existent. All would allow for a radically different look of the debris kick up."

23123,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@zaxck1365 apparently you are so I'll just have to spell it out for you, smoke is any form of particle clashing against light, literally all forms of element can cause ""smoke""
This makes all forms of mineral and gases a form of ""smoke"" with the most common type of smoke being carbon dioxide/monoxide. The f*cking sun is made primarily out of gases, being mostly hydrogen.
ON TOP of all that there is nothing saying that there is no air in space, the vastness of space just takes whatever air was there and spreads it everywhere, so instead of a concentration of gases like we have on Earth because of our atmosphere, the gas is spread out to so little it's about as small as an electron.

Do you currently complain about all the existing antennas everywhere? You are surrounded by them if you pay attention. Shortwave broadcast, AM and FM broadcast, TV broadcast, emergency service repeaters, ham radio antennas including repeater towers, cell phone transceiver towers, TV Shortwave AM and FM reception antennas, private radio network antennas for companies communicating with and tracking vehicles, wifi antennas, and more both large and small. 

Yes, there are a lot of studies on problems with space debris orbiting the Earth but none of that applies in the long term to anything considered to be in Low Earth Orbit. Anything in that region still experiences drag from the outer edges of the atmosphere and without thrusters reboosting to gain altitude it will slowly encounter more and more drag, slow down, fully reenter the atmosphere, and burn up during reentry. So even if the entire company were to vanish overnight the sat would eventually quite literally fall out of the sky and destroy themselves rather than remaining in orbit and becoming navigational hazards. To put it in perspective the ISS orbits at an altitude of 254 miles above the surface while Starlink sats only orbit at max altitude of 350 miles. If one completely fails the estimate is it would deorbit in around 5 years. In other words. They are by design using an orbit where if nobody keeps telling them to use their thrusters occasionally to maintain altitude they will self destruct and leave nothing behind to be a problem for anybody."

23286,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@rissyrizz That is untrue  and we all know it.  But I will give you an ""E"" for effort!...."
23287,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@hackerx7329 I appreciate you for taking the time and thoroughness to explain in detail about the satellites and their functions thereof.  Also the different scenarios and examples of what could or should happen.  I also appreciate you for pointing out different factors as well.  I'm still not a big fan of Man filling up our worlds orbit with potential hazards as some things have reentered our atmosphere and did not fully burn up, as China has twice now been called out for and luckily that debris landed in the indian ocean, but had the whole world on notice.

Nonetheless, I do hope for a better & safer world for us younger generations that are still growing up, going to start our own family's and so on, and what world we leave behind.  I had to laugh at the acronym ""BUD"" because my Grandfather had one of those and so did a lot of his neighbors and they are Butt Ugly Dishes and he was always having issues with it. ü§£

Well thanks again and have a good & safe New Year!.... ‚úåüèº"
23288,9ItvwqiehD0,Cool hey
23289,9ItvwqiehD0,"You should see my ""green"" antenna tower. Old ash tree that died from ash borers. 20 feet up the trunk I got me some scrap lumber screwed into a fork in the branches. Then I lopped off the tops. Next I got ma a pipe and attached the biggest TV antenna I could find. Next I hoisted it up and attached it to the trunk with the pipe resting in the fork. Picking up 42 channels of free TV.
Wear your blindfold! ROTFLMAO"
