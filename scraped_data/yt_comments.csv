0,9ItvwqiehD0,Lets hope his not planning any attack with those
1,9ItvwqiehD0,Faster internet connection is the coverup and sales pitch. They will be used for global surveillance in a AI lead cashless society. Sone they will introduce microchip implants for humans which will become mandatory
2,9ItvwqiehD0,I HATE clickbait titles.  8 minutes and I still don’t know how the satellites are deployed.  👎
3,9ItvwqiehD0,So they will become militarized
4,9ItvwqiehD0,But if the weather is bad so will be your internet
5,9ItvwqiehD0,Satellites should be built with a self destruct feature that destroys said satellite
6,9ItvwqiehD0,That's the go lol trash the earth then start trashing the sky's lol
7,9ItvwqiehD0,Terrible title    Wasted 9 minutes
8,9ItvwqiehD0,The title is misleading. The video did not talk about How Starlink Satellites Are Deployed. Therefore it earned a dislike.
9,9ItvwqiehD0,actually it's superb to watch satellites cross the night sky when looking at the stars.
10,9ItvwqiehD0,Can you say Balloons?
11,9ItvwqiehD0,I have seen one of these  satellite trains I flew over head and starting glitching in and out one second ist there the next it fades out. Comes back on and so on for a bit then just disappears. Did not look real at all it looked like a halo Gram glitching in and out. 9 lights in the sky with one brighter light out front. Fakest shit I have seen in a while
12,9ItvwqiehD0,its  just balloons lol  https://youtube.com/shorts/y5GV0gzVqck?si=EcrDBT1_QhdsR2yV

19,9ItvwqiehD0,"Starlink has generated significant interest and excitement in the tech and internet connectivity communities. Its promise of providing high-speed internet access to remote and underserved areas is seen as a potential game-changer, especially for regions with limited access to traditional broadband options. Is it TRUE?"
20,9ItvwqiehD0,"Yes, I’m finally being able to communicate with my family who lives in the middle of the Amazon jungle and couldn’t have internet until they installed Starlink last week. He is also putting free internet for in many public schools so people can have access to knowledge by the river in the Amazon."
21,9ItvwqiehD0,"Edward L Keith, said that Space X, owes him. He's preparing a lawsuit against Elon for intellectual property rights. Not spaceX, Elon himself.

Personally: I think  Eddie  is crazy. All he did was consult, one time, during a lunch."
22,9ItvwqiehD0,Your title is misleading. Title is how it is DEPLOYED but the video is all about starlink can do and what might its effect in general.

What an absolute MESS!... 🙄"
54,9ItvwqiehD0,"Firstly. You wont be able to see thousands of moving dots everywhere. The satellites are small compared to the amount of space in space, you can also only really spot the satellites when they are released into orbit, they tumble / rotate initially to spread them apart, this causes light to reflect off them in all kinds of directions but it is only temporary, once positioned and in the correct orientation their black underside makes them completely invisible to the naked eye
Secondly, the satellites dishes or antenna arrays used by starlink are So small compared to satellites used in the past. You think in the future houses will be ugly because of satelite dishes?? Seriously? Ever heard of satelite tv? It's a thing and it has existed for years. You have probably seen tons of satelite dishes in your lifetime but never paid them any attention.."

61,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@_A4A There is no such thing as analog internet. Everybodies connection to it is digital. Even when people were using dial up connections. Modems modulated the digital signals so they could be carried by an analog line, it was still digital data.

Define ridiculously sized? Have you actually seen the size of the dishes used by Starlink? I think you may be imaging the older dishes people used back in the 1970s and 1980s that used C band for analog sat TV and were commonly referred to as BUDs (Big Ugly Dishes). Starlink dishes are smaller than even many of the Ku band dishes used for the digital sat TV services like Dish Network and Direct TV. Do you currently complain about all the existing antennas everywhere? You are surrounded by them if you pay attention. Shortwave broadcast, AM and FM broadcast, TV broadcast, emergency service repeaters, ham radio antennas including repeater towers, cell phone transceiver towers, TV Shortwave AM and FM reception antennas, private radio network antennas for companies communicating with and tracking vehicles, wifi antennas, and more both large and small. 

Yes, there are a lot of studies on problems with space debris orbiting the Earth but none of that applies in the long term to anything considered to be in Low Earth Orbit. Anything in that region still experiences drag from the outer edges of the atmosphere and without thrusters reboosting to gain altitude it will slowly encounter more and more drag, slow down, fully reenter the atmosphere, and burn up during reentry. So even if the entire company were to vanish overnight the sat would eventually quite literally fall out of the sky and destroy themselves rather than remaining in orbit and becoming navigational hazards. To put it in perspective the ISS orbits at an altitude of 254 miles above the surface while Starlink sats only orbit at max altitude of 350 miles. If one completely fails the estimate is it would deorbit in around 5 years. In other words. They are by design using an orbit where if nobody keeps telling them to use their thrusters occasionally to maintain altitude they will self destruct and leave nothing behind to be a problem for anybody."
62,9ItvwqiehD0,They can dim the brightness of their satellites
63,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@rissyrizz That is untrue  and we all know it.  But I will give you an ""E"" for effort!...."
64,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@hackerx7329 I appreciate you for taking the time and thoroughness to explain in detail about the satellites and their functions thereof.  Also the different scenarios and examples of what could or should happen.  I also appreciate you for pointing out different factors as well.  I'm still not a big fan of Man filling up our worlds orbit with potential hazards as some things have reentered our atmosphere and did not fully burn up, as China has twice now been called out for and luckily that debris landed in the indian ocean, but had the whole world on notice.

Nonetheless, I do hope for a better & safer world for us younger generations that are still growing up, going to start our own family's and so on, and what world we leave behind.  I had to laugh at the acronym ""BUD"" because my Grandfather had one of those and so did a lot of his neighbors and they are Butt Ugly Dishes and he was always having issues with it. 🤣

135,qs2QcycggWU,"Don palsy hits and too soon. In brief, Elon could create a party line in text messages, using the LTC downlink in GPS satellites. Which is decoded and every handset built in the last decade. To create a worldwide party line of text messages that's broadcast. Where the uplink is enter is interception of the cell phone tower transmissions. Which come booming out of their antennas. So loud that they are readable far beyond low earth orbit where the starlinks are. So modify the next generation of starlinks to also listen to those frequencies, and then broadcast down the L2C frequency, using a coding that's not interfering. Granted some will complain but if it's not interfering. Just a slight increase in the noise floor. A basketball team, gribbling and passing the ball until every player has touched the ball at least once. Where the first text sender, is assured delivery everywhere once It sees its message in the L2C it receives. Neither latency or bandwidth guaranteed. Just assurance of delivering. Will support every social network application, as all were born on a text message fabric. And still have that code embedded for legacy support. The handset takes the message, stores it in its internal database. Where unique It passes it on up the text message stack to all users. Where the internal text message database will contain, weeks if not years of from,-tos in relative time order. With payloads in the clear for apps that need to be compatible. With their first instantiations a decade ago. Good news is, delivery is assured to The world's population and their handsets. Bad news, the police and government lose their ability to absolutely censor. Other than perhaps as mandated antivirus filtering services. Use by government to censor, and others to limit children or employees access to things they should not hear or see. The police and governments, need to suck it up, what they lose is more than made up for visibility of all from to in relative time, gumshoe work possible by all. Where privacy as always and discrimination rules have to be enforced by human systems like the courts. Or the family buys the bullets, of those who speak politically incorrectly. The only security at the from to level that exist is operational security. Use it or lose it. One reason For a CEO to step aside. Is he now knows how to compete with himself and As CEO it would be up pure conflict of interest to remain. And any spacefaring nation that has floated their own GPS system can do this, where making the freedom to speak the right to speak, matched with the right to hear. Is utterly destabilizing to dictatorships and autocrats of all kinds, countries and individuals."

Until they pull off to the side of the road and reorient themselves, relative to reading an actual map about the next upcoming turn. The other nice feature about a party line text message service, which some of the existing services already claimed to be. But they forget that a let's connect every but one to everything. Only works if everyone can hear. And only the receiver can choose what to block, or use the equivalent of an antivirus package that they trust to filter what they can hear. Granted many do not use an antivirus folter even turn it off on purpose. Granted, the government could make it illegal to not run the filter they provide."

I don't know if the contest is over or if you had anyone else see the littlest one, but his contest was a blast to do while enjoying the video. Thank you for sharing this with us all. Your work here is one of the best documentaries I have ever been fortunate to enjoy and learn so much from.

258,qs2QcycggWU,"I love when people have the English subtitles for people who don’t understand what is said or mishear things, and then use (Canadian, American, Australian) for additional commentary, jokes, the same thing said with local jargon, etc."
259,qs2QcycggWU,"i see all those comments where people say they are some radio engineers or have physics degree, well i never even went to college, yet all this is just common sense to me. i understand all of it just fine. in fact this is pretty much how i visualize things in my head when signal is being sent.

for example when i use USB wifi adapter (which is different, i know, but similar), i can visualize how the signal works and where it goes/comes from. i have lot of wifi stuff, including grid antenna, large 2.4ghz antenna (about 1m in size) and bunch of smaller omni-directional and directional antennas. 
i always wondered why beamforming isn't used in smaller wireless antennas, but i guess it's because they wouldn't know where the station is.
i wonder if it would be viable. like if you're using a hotspot or friend's internet and know the exact location of wifi station or if you have GPS on laptop and walk around the approximate location of station, then based on wifi strenght you can use program like wifi hopper to pinpoint the exact location based on GPS and signal strenght. then beamforming would be viable as you only have to point the antenna in generic direction.

btw longest wifi (2.4ghz) link was about 500km by using regular directional antennas. they simply attached them to both ends and based on google maps, pointed them towards eachother. that's quite insane to think that this was done ON EARTH."
260,qs2QcycggWU,It makes the complexity of the alien signal in Contact look like a petroglyph.
261,qs2QcycggWU,"What I think is cool about the 3D animation model you're working with is it is a cumulative progression. All of what you made in the past, a lot of it can be re-used or adapted to projects in the future. This is a rare sight so see so thoroughly and correctly taken advantage of. That leaves the artists more time, over time, to make the show and need less time building its parts. The consistent style you settled on is good and the libraries of assets more and more useful every show you make. Using that paradigm is quite literally the only way this series can be economical. 3D animation takes a LOT of time and any way you can scrape efficiency into a workflow, the less arduous it is for everyone involved. The first several years of production are much much harder than any years after that, as long as you stay meticulously organized and only make new assets as you need to for a particular subject. Well done."

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup powdered milk
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter (or margarine)
1/4 cup evaporated milk
1 piece egg
1/2 cup sesame seeds
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, add the all purpose flour, powdered milk and baking powder. Combine and mix well.

2. In another bowl, combine the sugar, evaporated milk, melted butter and egg. Mix until well combined.

3. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Mix until well combined. Knead for a few minutes until smooth and sticky.

4. Grab a small portion of the mixture and then roll into a ball. Then, coat them with sesame seeds. 

5. When fully covered by sesame seeds, roll them again in your palm to make sure that the seeds will not fall. 

Do these steps with the rest of the ingredients.

Heat a lot of oil in a pan. 
Deep fry the binangkal balls until golden brown. 
Transfer them to a strainer or paper towel to drain excess oil.
Transfer the binangkal to a serving plate.

379,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks Sir😊
380,qs2QcycggWU,"My question was do you use blender for the animation, and the answer in the show notes us yes with the exact version. Very impressive use of Blender, BTW"
381,qs2QcycggWU,So cool
382,qs2QcycggWU,Genius
383,qs2QcycggWU,Extremely fantastic effort in this informative video. Thanks
384,qs2QcycggWU,Best video on YouTube i would say.

386,qs2QcycggWU,"@BranchEducation I am wifi engineer , ur video helped me to rebrush the concept of emf, interference and QAM. Kudos to ur hardwork and presentation skills😊"
387,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm in my seventies now but due the solid grounding of first principles in Physics that I received at secondary school whilst I was doing A level Physics. This video was clear and easy to understand, just wish that my lifelong friend and Physics teacher Mike Turner was still here to appreciate that what he taught me enables me to understand this stuff"
388,qs2QcycggWU,Niceeeee
389,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
390,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
391,qs2QcycggWU,i can't really choose my words to express my  appreciation for this really amazing work it is unique
392,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video .Thank You.
393,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
394,qs2QcycggWU,Use full information. Thank you 🥰
395,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent thx. How many satellites per 1 dishy and are they all in the same azimuth or more like a web.  I ask since if it was 1 azimuth then wouldn't a rectangular pcb make more sense.
396,qs2QcycggWU,"If our ancestors of 10 thousand years ago could see us today, they would understandably mistake us for gods."
397,qs2QcycggWU,Fun fact: I saw this video on Starlink
398,qs2QcycggWU,Home electricity bill 😂😂😂
399,qs2QcycggWU,You can turn it off when your not using it
400,qs2QcycggWU,Hello! Really congratulations for the video! I have a question. I did not understand how the signal can be modulated by phase if the phase is used to direct the signal towards the satellite.
401,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, what a time to be alive!"
402,qs2QcycggWU,This was a super cool video. Really enjoyed the nerdy details. The beam steering was particularly interesting.
403,qs2QcycggWU,"Create more videos like this, commenting from a third world country and it's dream to work with this technologies from here but still there is no bound for knowledge. Thank's a lot..."
404,qs2QcycggWU,This tech is the culmination of 150+ years of discovery. The engineers and physicists cannot be paid enough or given enough awards for their contributions. And thank you for creating the visuals to explain it all in simple easy to understand terms.
405,qs2QcycggWU,😮
406,qs2QcycggWU,I wish these kinds of videos had been presented to us when I was still in school/college.
407,qs2QcycggWU,"I am very happy I found this video, thank you! Very well made!"
408,qs2QcycggWU,"The aiming of individual antennas via phase shifting is nutty, think programing for each node with respect to its ~1,200 neighboring nodes on the dish to constantly alter their frequency (very small room for error). 

Then there's the whole aiming in the direction of something 100s of kilometers away every ~4 min & 🤯."
409,qs2QcycggWU,Too much information to digest.
410,qs2QcycggWU,FFFFFUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Why wouldnt the life be easy

412,qs2QcycggWU,браво!
413,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
414,qs2QcycggWU,"Was recommended to watch the video by one of my CS friends. 

Absolutely loved it. The whole video was very comprehensive and you guys made amazing graphics and visuals."
415,qs2QcycggWU,"The effort and detail put into this video is incredible.  Thank you for actually creating high quality original content, instead of just flooding YouTube with more parroting of surface-level information that is widely available.  Subscribed!"
416,qs2QcycggWU,"As an engineering student, this was a much better explanation of EMF signals than what my professor in physics class explained to me!"
417,qs2QcycggWU,EXCELLENT
418,qs2QcycggWU,this is a banger
419,qs2QcycggWU,great stuff
420,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder how Mr.Elon learnd all this stuff and combined it to create the starlink😂. Definitely mind blowing.
421,qs2QcycggWU,#STAR link FOR Bangladesh
422,qs2QcycggWU,nice explanation about starlink.
423,qs2QcycggWU,"Holy fUck 😮






We just use them for granted, let's appreciate their hardworks who've spent their lives to make our lives easier"
424,qs2QcycggWU,Of course this is all very easy to understand and intuitive

433,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you Branch Education for a well explained video.. But let's talk about Elon Musk in the reply section. what kind of humsn he is?
434,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder if I have a brain 🧠
435,qs2QcycggWU,Waw whats a animations of working simple way of communication of modern technology ...😊
436,qs2QcycggWU,OMG i love this vid
437,qs2QcycggWU,"This video was the closest data download to human brain, matrix style, I've seen. thank you for the compact, no bullshit and illustrated data feed. you really managed to create a ""phased array"" video for the viewers. thank you!"
438,qs2QcycggWU,"I counted 8 shooting stars.

Also, lol at the line ""now let's open Dishy McFlatface"""
439,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool 😎

445,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work? Freaking awesome. That’s how. We live on a farm in rural Texas and have always struggled with internet speeds. Until we installed a Starlink system. From 12 -20 MPs, to 200-300+ MPs.  Well worth the money if you live out in the sticks. IMHO.

446,qs2QcycggWU,This is like magic.
447,qs2QcycggWU,bro some dudes can math for real
448,qs2QcycggWU,bro im using it and this shit works better than fiber
449,qs2QcycggWU,😆I wonder how the Flat Earther look at this video
450,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation
451,qs2QcycggWU,"My brain meling like a copper.....😂
How did you study and explain to us ? 
Hats off bro...
Keep educate our society....❤❤❤"
452,qs2QcycggWU,I am curious how starlink works under rain?
453,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, I am a student from Bangladesh.  The students there are in a very bad situation for some time.  1000+ students were killed because they spoke for their rights.  You can see the news about the brutal attack on the students.  It was all a pre-planned and political attack.  But when the students started protesting for their rights, and the government failed to prevent it, all the servers of the network were shut down in the whole country, so that the news would not spread among people or other countries.  All sim networks and broadband were off for about 6 days.  During those 6 days students were killed continuously.   So we just want a stable network connection that will always stay connected in any situation. Please Inform us if you can cooperate.  Then we will be obstructed to you. 
Thank you."
454,qs2QcycggWU,So where does the content for the satellites come from to beam down to our Starlink dishes?
455,qs2QcycggWU,"There's a base station on earth that the satellites in space connect to. In other words, when you download a file, for instance, your download comes from the server and gets sent to the base station's network. Then it gets beamed up to space to the satellite. Then, it gets beamed down to Earth to your Starlink dish and then sent to your computer. The process happens in reverse when you send data from your computer, say a voice call."
456,qs2QcycggWU,"This tech is right on time! Thank you for the research, I hungry for more. Elon is giving us what we need ❤"
457,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing 🤯 Thanks for providing such content
458,qs2QcycggWU,"Despite finishing the video, I didn't really understand it."
459,qs2QcycggWU,THNX
460,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks.
461,qs2QcycggWU,I  like 😊 favourite voice expression explication…sounds musicals…😮🖥️👏
462,qs2QcycggWU,"Genius! This video is definitely mind-blowing!

I wonder if there were written articles fully explaining this concept, or if you understood it simply by dissecting the device? If the latter is true, you are absolutely the king!"
463,qs2QcycggWU,""" I don't care 😛👎🏻"
464,qs2QcycggWU,"What an awesome video, thanks."
465,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for spending all the time and effort into making this video. This video with its animation covers a complex topic in an easy way for non-tech people to grasp the idea.
466,qs2QcycggWU,I love the videos you make
467,qs2QcycggWU,"This video was fantastic. Hard science and maths, explained in such a way that I could understand. Thank you for all your hard work."
468,qs2QcycggWU,"1st  i watched the vid at 0,5x speed and then 2,0x the 2nd time. But it canceled each other out so i understood nothing :("
469,qs2QcycggWU,"It's difficult to reconcile the engineering feats this details with the ever present risk of CME and solar flares looking to bring down the feather and wax design that mythology coldly reminds us of our modern constructs.  The goal of providing deep powerful and durable communication pathways to support this amazing platform is daunting and the effort of the smartest savants and genius minds from so many divisions of science leave only a strange sense of wonder that cannot be described but only felt by the onlooking participant in this masterful system of operation.  All the economics and industry and orbital pathway coordinates held tightly...I am left to a mentAl flat spin of sorts that leave me praying to God for all the souls that wish not for short latency but perhaps a meal or a blanket as they lay without either under these same satellites .  Elon, his dreams, and technology all coordinated to provide function with respect to the challenges science has engaged with the brilliant design, development and  operation of the satellite system.  I am in awe and humbled while grounded in this terrestrial land as are all but the few who have flew as high as those Starlink machines.  Wow."
470,qs2QcycggWU,Why do they have to move so fast?
471,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!
472,qs2QcycggWU,64QAM reminds me bad time in high school classes lol
473,qs2QcycggWU,What about the line of sight problem?
474,qs2QcycggWU,"😂😂😂I am a Bangladeshi citizen, can I get some information from you.  Can you make this #starlink service free for one day?  For any country.  Can you use the Internet directly through satellite?

483,qs2QcycggWU,Highly educative. Nice work.
484,qs2QcycggWU,Very good video but my head is buzzing
485,qs2QcycggWU,"Terrific video. I don’t have much depth in the electronics behind this being a software guy, but I do have some generic questions:

Some things I would be more curious about is what is the signal drop rate when transferring to and back from the satellite and how different types of weather might affect the reliability. 

Also whether are any connection states that are kept on the satellites and if so how  might they be transferred to the other satellite in the range of dishy?"

490,qs2QcycggWU,"I mounted the dish to a client but when it came to signing in using the email adress it kept showing,""wrong email adress ""yet that's the email adress the client uses.You guys need to train installers about it being that it's a new invention.Though the speed is abnormally high.Congrats"
491,qs2QcycggWU,what a beautiful and simple explanation. The details you put in your video is amazing. SUBSCRIBED
492,qs2QcycggWU,Mind is literally blown from the concept of phase array beam steering. Always thought they had to be mechanically steered/aimed. Using interference to steer is brilliant.
493,qs2QcycggWU,"Too much about the dish, no info on the SATELLITE."
494,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video. Coudnt have been better shown. Helped me in understanding the whole process. Thanks
495,qs2QcycggWU,This video did such a great job of breaking down a complex topic!
496,qs2QcycggWU,"These videos are transformative, esp to those underprivileged who now can aspire to dream big. 
Thank you a ton for your hard work. 
You are making real difference to education."
497,qs2QcycggWU,might be the biggest fail in the 2000's  they have to replace 8000 satelites a year think your rates will go lower or higher just more space junk that nasa has to dodge on space lunches
498,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video
499,qs2QcycggWU,"Good grief!!! Just stick it in a black box, seal it up and don't open it."
500,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best channels ! Explained everything in minute details ! Subscribed 👍🏼
501,qs2QcycggWU,64 QAM  seems too low a modulation scheme for HDTV signal. why not 256 QAM or is the modulation variable may be on demand./
502,qs2QcycggWU,"When encoding the 6-bit binary data as an amplitude and phase shift combination, what is the phase-shift measured with respect to?Is there a separate clock signal that both sides are synchronized to?"
503,qs2QcycggWU,This is perfect
504,qs2QcycggWU,0:10 are you sure the sattelites are constantly angling?
505,qs2QcycggWU,I still have a long way to go but we'll get there. Greate video indeed.
506,qs2QcycggWU,"Appreciate this, subscribed."
507,qs2QcycggWU,Man this video is crazy
508,qs2QcycggWU,Yeh very cool but why in southern hemisphere why are so many sattilites over the ocean and less over land eg over country south Australia where get heaps of dropouts
509,qs2QcycggWU,Melhor video que ja vi sobre um o topico

Mrs Richards: ""I'm not satisfied. But I shall stay. But I expect a reduction.""  
Basil: ""Why?! Because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment  ?"
511,qs2QcycggWU,Am I dumb for having to watch it the first time at 1.0X speed?
512,qs2QcycggWU,"no, but you're dumb for thinking it actually matters. you wouldn't understand it at any speed."
513,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for  helping all of us understand phase array
514,qs2QcycggWU,This is an awe-inspiring demonstration of radio energy. I wish this technology was available back when I went to school! I never thought I would be going through it 45 years later !!!
515,qs2QcycggWU,The technologie used in this antenna is called Phased Array Beam Steering so you dont need motors every 5 minute to ajust it once the satellite is fade
516,qs2QcycggWU,Sick vid bro
517,qs2QcycggWU,Why does starling residential NOT HAVE A PHONE NUMBER FOR CUSTOMER SUPPPRT?? Not ordering from a company that won't support (phone) thier own product. Was a viable solution to my problem... shame
518,qs2QcycggWU,"Did Elon need permission from somewhere to put up all these sattelites? And if yes, from where?"

Awesome job I am an electronic engineer and your videos and graphics explain the science behind technology so clear, I just wish I could've had this way of teaching science and technology!! Thank you and you just got a new Fan because as a teacher you have open my mind and how to educate"
524,qs2QcycggWU,Have no words to explain your work. More videos desired
525,qs2QcycggWU,I've had it for a year and it aint worth $161 a month. There is a 4 hour period that it's unusable. Good luck streaming youtube. I hope someone comes in my area so I can get rid of it.
526,qs2QcycggWU,I am intrigued by the “small” details that make this work! It is amusing!

530,qs2QcycggWU,"Im a phased array ultrasonic testing technician, and the way these antennas work are of similar concept on how we do testing. The only difference are the mechanism and type of pulses are transmitted or received. How these arrays/pulses/signals get focused, steered, processed and how these calculations are done very rapidly is very smart, it's another level."
531,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
532,qs2QcycggWU,what about the inter-satellite laser connection?
533,qs2QcycggWU,"Without the visuals, the commentary 😮 meant nothing.  Or do I mean that to be the other way around 🤔.  You're right. The video needs to be watched in as many nanos and picas you kept mentioning, not forgetting the bits.  Thanks for your efforts  - I'll definitely watch it again."
534,qs2QcycggWU,This video is amazing! Well done!
535,qs2QcycggWU,Please update this video if you get sued by Starlink lol

537,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome,  mind is totally blown out, the way it's clearly explained.. wow.. hats off to the content creator..  respect to brain of ""Elon Musk"" 🙂"
538,qs2QcycggWU,"this explanation is just, insane"
539,qs2QcycggWU,Never found a video explaining it so wonderfully!
540,qs2QcycggWU,Top notch video
541,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks a lot for this great work & vulgarization , mind blowing👍"
542,qs2QcycggWU,What??
543,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video as I was not aware of Starlink's operating characteristics. I assumed OFDM as in orthogonal frequency division. The 64 QAM modulation provides 6 bits per frequency per symbol period, which is not bad for communicating 500 miles away, and also with all the other effects that must be factored in like doppler and the need for channel frequency correction. In cell phones and WiFi we now in 5G/6G go up to 1024 and even 4096 instead of 64 QAM, more bits per symbol but they only have to transit a few kilometers or a few feet in the case of WiFI.  The finer the constellation the grid the more you need a good channel condition. The error vector magnitude which is the noise component must be small or errors come into play.  One additional thing that could be mentioned is there is a need for reference signals, which along with the data symbol have a known amplitude ( 1 ), and a determined phase. When detected the reference signal allows us to rotate the  signal received and scale them to get a good grid on which we can detect what the value transmitted is. Another thing not mentioned is forward error correction. We add many more bits to the transmitted signal and are able to figure out which bits were not received correctly and correct them. I am sure there are control channels, probably a random access channel to gain the satellites attention. Great video, keep them coming."
544,qs2QcycggWU,oh
545,qs2QcycggWU,Wow....
546,qs2QcycggWU,WOW  !!!!!!!!!!
547,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing

555,qs2QcycggWU,From this video.. I appreciate the price of Starlink
556,qs2QcycggWU,How does latency compares with regular cable under the ocean? Let's say I am in Europe and I play a video game on a server which is located in the USA. How much lag would I have using Starlink compared to regular internet?
557,qs2QcycggWU,This video made me feel so damn.

So when de satellite sends to Dishy, Dishy receives with an undirected antenna but then the satellite antenne aims the signal at Dishy? Although there are more than one Dishy on the ground the Satellite has to aim a beam simultaneously at many Dishys...  And the other thing not covered in this video, when one satellite goes out of site, Dishy has to switch to another satellite to keep the internet connection up and running. So this re-aiming the beam must be done very quickly... Unbelievable this all, but it works.
I juist thought of another question. The satelliet communicates with a groundstation. However it will be in radio contact also only for about 2 minutes, so do the Starlink satellites communicatie amongst each other to relay the internet link? Or how does that work?"
588,qs2QcycggWU,If I had the chance I would put starling in every home around the world. In that good of sales guy
589,qs2QcycggWU,"Very clear explaination👍👍👍
Even for me who had limited English ability knew how it work...
I lived in a remote village at West Borneo province, Indonesia...
In here,finding mosquitoes easier than finding internet signal😁😁😁
For seeking internet signal we must walk up hills and looking for a few internet signal spots....
Due to my economy condition,I can buy it....
My monthly salary as a worker in a palm oil plantation just around $200,if $1=15K IDR....
Even I can saving my money(and my family will eat grass😁😁😁),I still can't buy it....
In Indonesia you must use credit card in Starlink transaction and pay it monthly bill....
I don't have credit card,I just have an ordinary ATM card...
But I have a dream,If God will, someday I will use this Mr.Musk sophisticated tool's🙏🙏🙏"
590,qs2QcycggWU,U right. My mind is blowing.. <3 Thanks for ur Work <3
591,qs2QcycggWU,"How dangerous is it to stand in front of the dish? 

Anyway, great video! Just got our Starlink a few days ago so am very interested in the tech."
592,qs2QcycggWU,That was the best explanation of QAM I have seen.
593,qs2QcycggWU,"Neat, very informative, keep up the good work."
594,qs2QcycggWU,it is nice to see military tech from 30+ years ago (AESA) finally reaching civilian tech (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_electronically_scanned_array)
595,qs2QcycggWU,A beautiful explanation for such a complex technology ❤
596,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
597,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
598,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
599,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for helping out!  I appreciate it!
600,qs2QcycggWU,"the amount of engineering, math and physics in this devices surrounding ourselves keep getting surreal. I didn't have a big mind to creat any device of mine, but I hope my kids would do, at least one of them 😅. Thanks very much for the explanation Branch Education and keep up the work."
601,qs2QcycggWU,How can they communicate with pole coordinates without changing the direction of the beam? They both use fase shifting. Why doesn't the consructive interference (and so the direction of the beam) change when a signal with an other fase has to be send?
602,qs2QcycggWU,Great info and visualization!
603,qs2QcycggWU,I ain't watching it twice grandpa

621,qs2QcycggWU,when the maths heads up definetly we have to move on
622,qs2QcycggWU,How does one satellite talk to many dishies on the ground?
623,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, great video. I wonder how much is the power density of the signals emited by these saielites. I'm sure they are within the FCC approved limits but as I cant afford a Narda Rf meter to measure all those signals I'm launching this question to more fortunate people who can and did measure any of this."
624,qs2QcycggWU,"but why here in my loc: 5.0394,119.7414 Philippines very slow only 3mbps?"

628,qs2QcycggWU,"Great content! Thank you for sharing. I'm learning a lot of new concepts here. As a former physics student, it's mesmerizing to see these ideas come to life beyond the books."
629,qs2QcycggWU,"could you please do a video on how phased array radars work (particularly how ""look-down-shoot-down"" functionality works?

and also how ""scan"", ""track while scan"", and ""lock"" functions of the radar work?"
630,qs2QcycggWU,Don’t stand next to Starlink antennae as strong microwave frequency will gives you cancer like the rats in the lab! Oh just kidding😂
631,qs2QcycggWU,"This is probably one of the best videos on this topic out there. Not too overly simplified, but not so jargony and obfuscated either. RF is essentially black magic, and this video has brought me one step closer to understanding the dark arts."
632,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!
633,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video!
634,qs2QcycggWU,Thx!
635,qs2QcycggWU,Wow....just wow
636,qs2QcycggWU,Am using a starling to watch this video.  Is mind blowing
637,qs2QcycggWU,So much complexity and engineering some great people s did for a generation that dance in front of a camera and make tik tok lol
638,qs2QcycggWU,How about C-Band TV or MPEG2  FTA or MPEG4 FTA???

645,qs2QcycggWU,Let's show the love for each other and never give up on each other or are would or I kids much love 💖
646,qs2QcycggWU,"Hmm, in only to 3:20 or so and you're going to tell me that Starlink coverage in non-existent over the poles? Is that some Classified crap?

Okay, FYI, phased array antennae and their capabilities have been around for a very long time. Only because of computing speeds has it become more of a danger/help. Make not mistake, your data/comm is being kept and may be evaluated for some reason.

At 21:51 they're talking about comm capabilities that would have been on Malaysia Flight 370. Why can't they tell us where/when those capabilities ceased to exist. Not to mention the Rolls Royce engines that continually talk back to the mother ship in Europe. 

Overall, this is a very well done teaching aid! I could only wish to be able to present such information in, what actually is, seventh grade science in my estimation."
647,qs2QcycggWU,"If the module can steer the beam in a wide array of directions without moving the motors, then why do the motors move the platform normally to the satellite when the system is powered on? To start with a stronger baseline signal before steering the beam as minor adjustments during the day?
We use one of these systems for work and I had no idea of the complexity of this system. Thanks for making another great video! Wish more channels produced content of this quality."

It will take a few goes at watching it to remember it, but im asolutly fascinated with it.
Also, the penny droped a bit for me with the coding side. (Ive never done coding and didnt realy understand it, but visualising the 1 and 0 format was good."

707,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video and technology!!
708,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for providing , very interesting. Explains nicely communication between the dish and the satellite , question for follow up would be great to see how does the satellite then connect to the “internet” / ground stations and where are they, are is the work or only at the us ? Do the satellites communicate with eachother or is every satellite able to reach a ground station at isp or starlink home ?"

794,qs2QcycggWU,U said we need to be a multidisciplinary student. And yes and u have achieve that. The problem is when u want to make something lucrative or creative u need money. And that stop u from being like Elon musk. The journey of him is fantastic. So are u blessed with all this knowledge without contributing to the real world or u just want to spread this knowledge generously and let people take their course in it and whoever have that power money can do something about it later. There's no one in entire world who can make use of this wide range of knowledge without some restraint from the people itself or the government. I just hope we can make do with this knowledge and make human realise more in emerging technology rather than the war itself. Thank you but no thank you

796,qs2QcycggWU,Another great video
797,qs2QcycggWU,Watching on dial-up phone
798,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful explanation! Thanks!
799,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you. Could you make a video explaining 5G telecommunications?
800,qs2QcycggWU,so nice
801,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible content! Thanks a lot for your video. Wish you all the best!
802,qs2QcycggWU,Would be really nice if you made one off these videos but with all the deep dives into the math and physics 😁
803,qs2QcycggWU,wow
804,qs2QcycggWU,I'm watching this through Starlink
805,qs2QcycggWU,cool
806,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content. wonder why are there only 1.7M subscribers. Amazing channel
807,qs2QcycggWU,"With the little but growing experience i have working for a telecommunication company, i at least see the clear picture."
808,qs2QcycggWU,applause teacher.
809,qs2QcycggWU,do starlink satelites have a destruction protocol to not kill people on the coming down?
810,qs2QcycggWU,"Travel at 17,000mph and burn up in the atmosphere."
811,qs2QcycggWU,"The Truth:

Starlink is lag. 
$3500 Startup
$150 month + all their fees. Call it $210 a month"
812,qs2QcycggWU,This is also an upgraded version of stolen technology. Musk is a rat.

822,qs2QcycggWU,It actually works really well and is super fast and simple. I highly recommend it
823,qs2QcycggWU,Cool idea.. they must create a lot of orbital clutter though
824,qs2QcycggWU,Dope content
825,qs2QcycggWU,Gg cool vid
826,qs2QcycggWU,2 years in and it works amazing.  Top 5 transformational products in my lifetime.  Keep it poppin’ baby.
827,qs2QcycggWU,something is missing on the sattelite dish
828,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
829,qs2QcycggWU,19:00 is soo cool
830,qs2QcycggWU,"I spent months researching phased array antennas and their functionality. At last, I discovered one of the finest videos on the subject available online!"
831,qs2QcycggWU,Do you see the irony of this. The same guy who wants to go to Mars will be responsible for launches into space being impossible. It's not the satellite it's the number of satelites in low earth orbit travelling at  27000km per hour. Starlinks' goal is something like 45k satelites with a life expectancy of 4 years. So constant replacements will need to be launched. This will make it almost impossible to escape earth without crashing into a starlink satelite. Critical thinking is not cynicism.
832,qs2QcycggWU,"There are no satellites in the world. They are fooled by satellites and they only use old technology which is only updated, such as the original White Alice, which reflects the signal back to the ground via a satellite dish."
833,qs2QcycggWU,I am amazed
834,qs2QcycggWU,"first branch education video i've come cross. just amazing
and, wow the human potential this technology demonstates, just mind blowing"

Obviously on top of it would melt it!!😂"
882,qs2QcycggWU,This is really awesome thanks for creating the video just having a thought if we can create say a quantum based antenna to send and receive at the same time the only restriction on data transfer would be the limit on the computing of the data and the speed of the transmission right?

I Love  your  starlink  internet"
887,qs2QcycggWU,I watched this video describing how data is transmitted over StarLink with data bits that transferred over StarLink !! 🤯
888,qs2QcycggWU,"Similar techniques can be used to apply the signals from several microphones in an auditorium, to create a directional microphone that can focus on the voice of any speaker. This makes possible Q & A sessions at public events without the need to have participants line up at a central microphone."
889,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown by the complexity of this technology and the depth of this video.
890,qs2QcycggWU,"1. how does one satellite communicate with multiple dishies at the same time? what is the maximum number of dishes one satellite can communicate with?

2. why do they use same anntenas to send and receive? would have been much cooler if the dishy can simultaniously send and receive

P.S. awesome video, I think you can also make an amazing video about how each satellite communicate with others, how  SpaceX chooses the positions of this satellite, how are they maintained..."
891,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW!!

If Star Link have ANY In site they should Reach out to you and PAY you for the use of this Video!!"

909,qs2QcycggWU,cool
910,qs2QcycggWU,Video is great. But only small % I understand.
911,qs2QcycggWU,How do they move that fast through the sky? Actually? How do they move at all?

914,qs2QcycggWU,"Questions , but amazing video, thank you so much for the detailed information. 
1. How do these electro magnetic waves emitted by Starlink satellites and Disheys interact/interfere with bees (I’ve heard of cellphone towers disrupting bee colonies)?
2. How do these powerful electromagnetic waves interact/interfere with humans on the biological cellular level? 
3. With so many satellites up there, and with aircraft being closer to the satellites, does this increase the chances of airplane pilots or someone standing in the path of the beam increase the chances of  getting cancer?
4. The disheys have a slight sound to them. Can you please explain what this sound is? 
I counted 21 shooting stars, but I was getting ready for church and cooking breakfast while watching at speed 2x."
915,qs2QcycggWU,wow

930,qs2QcycggWU,This is new one for me
931,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the comprehensive and mindblowing animation!
932,qs2QcycggWU,"So, when I understand that correct: The position of the Starlink satellites are programmed into the firmware of the dish, consequently I can only use the satellites that are programmed into the firmware. In order to use new satellites as Starlink launches new ones, it's very important to upgrade the Firmware frequently otherwise I can't use them, right?

Further, if old satellites die because they only have a life span of 5 yeas, but the firmware on the dish don't know that because of an old firmware, the Dish will try to connect to a dead satellite?"
933,qs2QcycggWU,Now China can copy 😂
934,qs2QcycggWU,👌👌👌
935,qs2QcycggWU,🎉 well done!❤
936,qs2QcycggWU,"Reversing the uplink and downlink frequencies, what does this mean? It is revolutionary in communications systems, but unexpected errors will have high probability events?! Then how to reduce these issues !?"

989,qs2QcycggWU,i look at dishy on my roof and go wow ?
990,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a radio engineer. I just want to say....Waw, explaining beam forming using massive antenna array ! That is very hard thing to do but you had the simplest and clearest explanation that I have ever seen!"
991,qs2QcycggWU,"Back in 2006, I used to develop similar antenna 4x8 (feeding network, patch antenna) for Inmarsat system  for my MSc work at Wroclaw University of Technology. It used to work for L1-band (GPS). 

What impressed me in this video was, how they easily explained the beam forming and shifting principles.  They also mentioned about the side lobes, to complete the topic. What I have missed here (what IMHO is also very exciting) is the technique to achieve the circular polarization (just by adding  90 or 180 deg phase shifter beetween feed lines).  Anyway, great work.

Btw, the concept of array antenna with electronically controlled lobe is principle of modern radar systems ..."
992,qs2QcycggWU,"i never even went to college, yet i understood this before i even watched the video. to me, it's all common sense.
i only watched this to confirm what i already knew, there were few minor details i didn't expect, but basically i knew the concept.
i remember someone once thought that antenna is suppose to constantly move and said his antenna is broken because it doesn't constantly turn... DUH."
993,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!
994,qs2QcycggWU,The F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet's radar is equipped with an array of antennas. Its beam is limited to 80 nm (150 km). The antenna cannot track 1 million objects. But the satellite can track zillions of antennas on the earth?
995,qs2QcycggWU,This is what I call near perfect education! Wow really impressive
996,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing
997,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for the clear and consice explanation. 
This technology is derived from military applications like the F 35 stealth systems"
998,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent information. Thank you for the information.

1005,qs2QcycggWU,❤❤❤❤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽😎👍
1006,qs2QcycggWU,"People this old technology which I learned in my junior year. Antenna arrays beam forming has been used for many things including detection of a target.
This was a Marketing video to get a bunch of new recruits to sign up. Stick to your course work and design antenna of various flavors, learn as much as you can in your RF course work. And, learn more on cube satellites and don't forget you'll have to learn more of software defined satelites. You will need to read up on SCA Software Communications Architecture, then you might be able to get past this Markeing bait of a Trump like University."
1007,qs2QcycggWU,"Sounds like the work done on Spaceway.
Bigest problem is that it requires a clear sky. But, like Tesla cars, it is over hyped. Do you think the Con artist s really going to tell the truth?"

1014,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm an engineer, and thus I was amazed by the level of detail provided here, it is very educational and in my perspective one of the most valuable videos over the internet for the content, simplicity to explain, and understanding level of the subject explained.  Please continue to do more videos like it, I'm for sure watching this video a couple of times more to pay attention to details that I missed on the first watch. Kudos to the people that created it!!"
1015,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice video. Please Make a video on Neuralink!😊😊😊
1016,qs2QcycggWU,"Question: One of the complaints I've heard about dishy is the power draw being around 100W - quite high if you're remote or powering from batteries. As the video showed, the more antenna the greater the power of the beam coming from dishy due to constructive interference. As manufacturing techniques improve is it conceivable that you could get the same beam power by increasing the density of antennas and reducing the power/amplitude of the wave signals fed to them so that the total power draw is reduced?"
1017,qs2QcycggWU,What a wonderful explanation!😮😮
1018,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for your video sir very interesting and informative

1022,qs2QcycggWU,"i Have had Starlink installed for a year now. It suddenly stops working.  I go on my app & do all the troubleshooting. I suspect the router & put in a report stating I suddenly don't have internet.  You have to do this online even though your internet is down.  I get a response with a copy past saying ""Your Starlink hardware appears healthy upon initial review. There are no major alerts or setup issues that have been identified that would impact your speeds.

From the network side, you may experience varying or slower speeds during peak hours of network usage. Peak hours are the times during the day when many Starlink users are trying to use their service at the same time, which is typically in the evening. This is more common in densely populated regions. You may notice this more particularly when streaming or playing games.

As Starlink continues to launch satellites and build out our ground network, your service will continue to improve. Engineers are dedicated to improving the our network capabilities across the globe and optimize performance.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please respond to this ticket""   I responded with saying I had no internet & I think is the modem. long story short I went into town & bought a new system. Bought it home plugged in the new router & instant internet. still no response from ""help"" not happy with the level of ""service"""

1027,qs2QcycggWU,Exceptionally clear explanation of Phased array and QAM and the overall understanding of the Starlink data transfer is so easy to ingest. The voiceover and graphics are exceptional. Best technical video I have ever seen and I have been in IT for 50 years.
1028,qs2QcycggWU,How can starlink satellite communicate with multiple starlink dishes and find out which is which.
1029,qs2QcycggWU,❤❤❤
1030,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Mind blowing and incredible technology and creativity. Just Wow !
1031,qs2QcycggWU,I did subscribed and liked at that exact moment 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿😂
1032,qs2QcycggWU,insane!
1033,qs2QcycggWU,Video is very informative it reveals the engineering mystery and mechanism behind digital device’s……thank you alot keep conveying
1034,qs2QcycggWU,Another infernal amount of substantially useless and dangerous electromagnetic waves on our heads....
1035,qs2QcycggWU,I worked as a radio and antenna engineer for over 30 years. This video really provides an extraordinary explanation. Thank you so much for giving us videos like this. We are waiting for other great videos
1036,qs2QcycggWU,"wow...I just subbed...never seen a high-quality expressed science movie like this before...do you have more lessons inclined with electrical and electronic engineering, I'm really interested if you do. 100/10 % work."
1037,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video <3 Thank you!
1038,qs2QcycggWU,와......
1039,qs2QcycggWU,This is mind blowing educational content
1040,qs2QcycggWU,This is mindblowing.
1041,qs2QcycggWU,"I think I'm missing something - I was always taught that with the thumb of your right hand pointing in the direction of the current, the curled fingers of your right hand follow the direction of the magnetic field. Is this different with AC?"
1042,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a bit long, but, hopefully I can help someone.

We recently installed StarLink and it has blown us away!  Our other satellite company provided us with approx.  2.5 mbps Upload and 7 to 12 mbps [clear night} download.
According to a few sites a speed of 5 Mbps is a good upload speed, an 10 Mbps.  When we installed StarLink, right after they finished installing all the satellites in North America,
within 5 minutes of turning on the router:

Device to Router: Download 724 Mbps        Lowest Speed Test:  Download 69 Mbps          
                                  Upload 333 Mbps                                                 Upload 49 Mbps
                                 

Router to Internet:  Download 166 Mbps      Lowest Speed Test:   Download 104 Mbps  
                                    Upload 19.4  Mbps                                                Upload 13 Mbps  


These numbers have fluctuated, depending on day and time, also cloudy, storms, etc.

YES, the equipment is pricey compared to free install for the other providers AND the monthly $120.00 is about $45.00 more than the price of our last provider, BUT, so what!!!!
StarLink is WORTH IT, if you have fiber optic, I do not see why you would need StarLink.  Fiber Optic is more consistent, HOWEVER, if you live in a rural area WITHOUT Fiber Optic,
StarLink is really the BEST OPTION, If you use the internet a lot.  

StarLink is always upgrading, so it will only get better from here, and possibly a bit more pricey.

My advice, if you use the internet for email and browsing, pretty much any satellite provider is OK.  Our neighbors are in the 80s, and they are very satisfied with what they have.  BUT, if you work online, game, watch movies, etc., ditch the other satellite providers and get StarLink, you will not regret it!  

Oh, the install was a bit rough, but that was because of our roof and it being higher than I can get to. Had to install it against our fascia, and lower than I wanted {but free of obstructions.}

{DANG, SpaceX should pay me for this OR I may charge for install consulting, hmmmm, lol!}"
1043,qs2QcycggWU,great stuff budddd
1044,qs2QcycggWU,amazing
1045,qs2QcycggWU,k j b k b k j b j k b j k b j k b j k
1046,qs2QcycggWU,And still 99% of internet communications are made through under water cables.
1047,qs2QcycggWU,Brauche ich eine Partnerschaft oder Team verantwortlich genommen
1048,qs2QcycggWU,Ich brauche PC zum Lächeln bringen
1049,qs2QcycggWU,"Ich bin nicht Blind aber lass ich es gern, wie die anderen PC benützen.............! Ich habe ein Pad .................."
1050,qs2QcycggWU,"As an engineer and happy Starlink user, I really appreciate this video ;-)"
1051,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!!!
1052,qs2QcycggWU,that's great. thanks for making this lesson.
1053,qs2QcycggWU,Very good. Very nice.
1054,qs2QcycggWU,Res je
1055,qs2QcycggWU,It send and receives data....  does it mean you can send malicious data to the satalite to heck it or take control of it?
1056,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. Thank you for the hard work.
1057,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video ! Congrats 👏
1058,qs2QcycggWU,"What an amazing video of an amazing technology. Really top notch quality. I really enjoyed so much that I only watched it in 1,25 x speed and even though it was still long I felt like it was just a 5 minute video. So interesting and awesome. I felt like when I was a kid watching discovery channel documentaries with my dad."
1059,qs2QcycggWU,Very educational please add me to your weekly News update amazing ❤ am from papua new guinea 🇵🇬  and am really excited about the information that your people share thankyou very much keep up the good work..😂❤
1060,qs2QcycggWU,"Anything I’d say would just be a repeat of what they said. In short form. That was amazing. Question, where do base stations fit in to the system."
1061,qs2QcycggWU,"Superb Job, congrats. I would say that for the user terminal  CPU needs here a FPGA(or even ASIC) , not displayed in the video. Why? Because for the real-time, high-speed signal processing required for beamforming and tracking satellites the CPU is not suitable at all. So CPU should manage network functions, user interaction, and system controls.  So what i guess is that the chip you mention that calculates the phase angles for the beamformers, part of a digital signal processing (DSP) system, is fact either an fpga or an ASIC and doesnt run therefore any software, because is already configured in hw."
1062,qs2QcycggWU,I love this
1063,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for this awesome explanation.  Question, your video implies that the satellite focuses the beam to a single dishy. I doubt this is true. Could you explain or pick up in a future video how the satellite is able to send unique content to 1000s or more dishys at one time?"
1064,qs2QcycggWU,Very complicated 😮😮
1065,qs2QcycggWU,you did a very hard work! respect🤗
1066,qs2QcycggWU,"lol, you go from metric to imperial! Awesome videos though! Mind blowing!"
1067,qs2QcycggWU,Way more detailed than i would have thought. Amazing. I sort of get it.
1068,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You! this an amazing video. Please make more!
1069,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work @BranchEducation!
1070,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely best efforts from this channel 🙌😍♥️ Love it... 😋♥️
1071,qs2QcycggWU,god damn amazing!
1072,qs2QcycggWU,"hello m from india after watching this video i have 1 Q if I placed a dishy on my roof top so can i get the signal from the starlink satellite and get the internet connectivity or not?
 because i assumed in this video the starlink satellite are moving around the earth so they definitely moving over the India too.
And I have watched your video first time and i love to see this thank you"
1073,qs2QcycggWU,Can you make a detailed video on how quantum computer work?
1074,qs2QcycggWU,Another fantastic production.  Would love to see a video related to the internet and networking.
1075,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, just wow, please do wireless topics 4G LTE, 5G NR MIMO etc. this animation and explanation is amazing . I am subscribing right away"
1076,qs2QcycggWU,"Wonderful,,,,for the first time I have seen physics concepts explained so well I would love it when they connect them to masts😂,,,if they work hand in hand with optic fibres we would get some really good internet connection"
1077,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely fantastic. This channel never ceases to amaze.
1078,qs2QcycggWU,"I like these videos, and actually liked the brilliant free trial but couldn’t buy the yearly plan"
1079,qs2QcycggWU,"awesome content, we need more"

1082,qs2QcycggWU,Actually all I know is how to feed my cat. And I`m happy about that :)
1083,qs2QcycggWU,super brilliant!
1084,qs2QcycggWU,You are great!
1085,qs2QcycggWU,Very excellent thank you so much
1086,qs2QcycggWU,So Streaming Dumb & Dumber wasnt so Dumb......😄
1087,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome - thanks for all the work on this. Great to learn cool stuff like this.
1088,qs2QcycggWU,Whoever invented this is an Alien
1089,qs2QcycggWU,Soo good
1090,qs2QcycggWU,Great job!
1091,qs2QcycggWU,This is space junk.. polluting out sky and space observations.
1092,qs2QcycggWU,"how to make this kind of videography, what application do you use"
1093,qs2QcycggWU,"there is a big error, i have starlink, but dont even think to stream more than one 1080p 60fps video.... it's his maximum it's not even close by what the  video is saying"
1094,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful video
1095,qs2QcycggWU,Відео дуже пізнавальне. Дякую.
1096,qs2QcycggWU,wow!
1097,qs2QcycggWU,"While I understand that my comment lacks detail I would like to say this:
This is awesome!!"
1098,qs2QcycggWU,posting this comment using starlink internet. Dude I love this stuff. Im in a rural area so this is amazing
1099,qs2QcycggWU,"According to Musk, Dishy doesn't know anything about the satellites in orbit. That's why it sits flat at first. It waits and listens for a satellite to talk to. I'm not even certain it knows what satellite will appear next. I think it just listens for a new one."
1100,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, it’s been many years since I studied communication systems but your video helped give me the general big picture about how starlink works. Thanks"
1101,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You!
1102,qs2QcycggWU,Essentially a phased array radar
1103,qs2QcycggWU,2ms to send packets to the satellite WTF????!!!!!! thats impossible wtffff
1104,qs2QcycggWU,but what about the time from the big main ground satellites to the servers like amazon or google would that be different than normal isp with fiber cables or just the same once the data reaches those satellites it switches to ground connection with fiber and no longer uses satellites?
1105,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome content,  thank you very much  for taking the time to explain with such clarity and visualisation"
1106,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done explanation of complex technology.
1107,qs2QcycggWU,dope
1108,qs2QcycggWU,Nice arrangement of information
1109,qs2QcycggWU,requisite comment
1110,qs2QcycggWU,Nice target for the S500.

1113,qs2QcycggWU,Very good! Thank you!
1114,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, its  really amazing"
1115,qs2QcycggWU,wow
1116,qs2QcycggWU,Thumb uP and subscribed! I don't understand all but extremely admire the technology created by humankind!
1117,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind bugling technology and amazing hardworking people behind such amazing technology, however it breaks my heart when I see such technological innovations being rent out to regimes such as the terrorist organization of Israel to target more innocent civilians 😢"
1118,qs2QcycggWU,Sweeeet!
1119,qs2QcycggWU,thanks!
1120,qs2QcycggWU,As a retired radio engineer this is a fabulous production. Crystal clear explanation of the subscriber connection. Have you made one for the other connection ... Satellite to satellite and satellite to ground stations ? I'm subscribed for sure !!
1121,qs2QcycggWU,It's a shame Starlink can't give me the winning Lottery numbers before the actual drawing happens ! 😂
1122,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question!

In the English (Canada) subtitles around three minutes, the notes mention a set up for satellite internet on a cruise ship. My question is, why is the geostationary dome and motor set up necessary? 

If I'm understanding the video correctly, the phase beam can shift using the coordinates and movement of the satellite, is it unable to factor in the coordinates of the cruise ship in those calculations as well and shift the beam accordingly? Or have cruise ships not adopted the starlink ""dishy"" and instead using traditional stationary satellites that don't have that capability? 

I hope this question makes sense, its pretty high level engineering/physics/math for someone who studies humanities in college! Thanks again for this awesome video. Learning about the space sciences are my hobby so I love highly detailed videos like these."
1123,qs2QcycggWU,Wow.
1124,qs2QcycggWU,i like your funny words bud haha (i dont understand a single thing in this video)
1125,qs2QcycggWU,good work thank you
1126,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate your work
1127,qs2QcycggWU,"I have been in the RF, Radar, and Comms industry since 1972. I have to say this is the best explanation  of RF and the Antenna theory explanation I've seen.
Thank you."
1128,qs2QcycggWU,"Not a whole lot of theory here, although there was one frame with a couple of equations. ;-) 
This was a very good explanation, using simple graphics, of the CONCEPTS of how the Dishy works."
1129,qs2QcycggWU,It’s crazy how engineers can build things so complex. There are countless variables involved and they still make it work.
1130,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice and informative video... thanks to all for creating such a good video content
1131,qs2QcycggWU,The switch between sattelite will ruin the ping as gamers + weather like rain and clouds
1132,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't
1133,qs2QcycggWU,Super Amezing beautiful 🎉🎉🎉
1134,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing details. I felt like someone who was finally being fed the food I’d always wanted. Now I can’t help but want even more!  Great job. Keep it up!
1135,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
1136,qs2QcycggWU,we need more educational channels like yours
1137,qs2QcycggWU,احسنتم مجهود اكثر من رائع . شكرا لكم من العالم العربي
1138,qs2QcycggWU,This is a VERY good explanation at the Dishy 101 level.
1139,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is an art. We used to learn EM using maxwells equation and our imagination to grab the idea. But this video, the fundamentals has been made easier for EM students."
1140,qs2QcycggWU,"How many shooting stars did you see throughout the video?  Post what you counted and we'll pick a random correct comment to receive a prize.  Also, check out the Creator's Comments found in the English (Canada) subtitles for many additional details.  Note: you can access them via the options button -> transcript -> English(Canada).  FAQ: Q1)  Do the two phase shifts from beam steering and 64QAM mess each other up?  A: No.  For transmission, the data is encoded into the 64QAM signal and sent to all the beamformers where then the beam steering phase shift is added.  Then the signal is sent to the front-end modules which increases the power for the patch antennas."
1141,qs2QcycggWU,Is SARLINK available in South Africa and at what price? Also if I immigrate to the UK can I take it with me and will it work wherever I go?
1142,qs2QcycggWU,execelent thank you elon for oportunity bravo3x
1143,qs2QcycggWU,How the movie or sound show by these codes in exact same time
1144,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Your videos are insane. Thanks for this.
1145,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
1146,qs2QcycggWU,Remote cabin in Northern WI have Starlink last summer and worked great. No cable or Direct TV nonsense. Hook up with app and worked within a few minutes. Turn on and off when you leave. No ongoing charges. This is big.
1147,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown.
1148,qs2QcycggWU,Great thanks to magnets!
1149,qs2QcycggWU,This is a great channel!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1150,qs2QcycggWU,"i was a radar tech in the navy, this is an Excellent, Grade A explanation. top notch"
1151,qs2QcycggWU,So eloquently explained
1152,qs2QcycggWU,Love the Video
1153,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink

1. There are no satelittes in 550 km Orbit.
There is no Orbit because the earth is not a globe (Buch von 1881  Samuel Rowbotham earth not a globe). Its flat.

2. Rockets do not work in vacuum. Can't.
Gregory Lessing Garrett: Why Rockets Don't Work in the Vacuum of Outer Space.

3. No manmade vehicle ever reached a speed of 28.000 kmh

4. No vehicle with a speed of 28000 kmh could ongoing send  massive Signals of hundreds of MB per second."
1154,qs2QcycggWU,"Ok there bud. So you're saying all the engineers that have worked on this are just liars?? You're saying that GPS, which uses satellites doesn't exist? There's no reasoning with you delirious idiots."
1155,qs2QcycggWU,I want more videos like this😎
1156,qs2QcycggWU,Every minute worth
1157,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! This is an amazing explanation so simplified that anyone with basic electronics knowledge can easily understand. Kudos also for the visuals. Actually, I am a visual learner. When I can't visualize something, I don't grasp it. You went to great length to explain this complex matter in the least simplistic, yet understandable terms. Great job"
1158,qs2QcycggWU,An absolute masterpiece of ingenuity. This video's quality does it justice. Quickest subscribe even though I'm already subscribed to more channels than I watch regularly. My respect!!!
1159,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent Video! I work in the modulation part of satcom but I never had a good explanation of how phased array works. Now I do! - Thanks!
1160,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing this even works!!!!  Excellent video!
1161,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blown. Amazing explanations, this is by far my favourite Science channel . Your quality in explanation and visuals are unmatched. Please make many more videos like this.

A few ideas:
 How does an electric engine work, maybe with reference to servo motors?

How does induction work in reference to ovens and induction charging( phones)
?

Maybe a video on some sensors, like electric thermometers, seizmic sensors, geiger counter, radios(basically covered in this video), movement sensors etc.

Maybe some material science would be cool, like next gen conductors etc.


Also nuclear reactors, fusion reactors stuff like that would be awesome. 

Thank you for your great service to the world."
1162,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video 😍 if I could animate my research like this my friends and family would finally understand what I'm doing. Amazing job! Very nice scientific communication!
1163,qs2QcycggWU,thank you! please continue to create amazing videos.
1164,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this excellent explanation! All this physics I studied in university, and principals are known. Yet, when it comes to explain this to someone who is not familiar to this technology, it becomes magic to me."
1165,qs2QcycggWU,more please.
1166,qs2QcycggWU,just can't believe I finally got a basic understanding on how phased arrays work. could you guys make one about phased array AESA radars?
1167,qs2QcycggWU,This was really interesting to watch! Thanks for the awesome content
1168,qs2QcycggWU,The communication path is mostly from the Startlink antenna to the satellite and then to several others before going back down to an earth station.
1169,qs2QcycggWU,"Superb animation. Tha ks you for that. I do note though that the TV satelite is shown as moving, however it is actually stationary w.r.t. the earth."
1170,qs2QcycggWU,It's a very interesting and informative video. Very professional work. Thanks!
1171,qs2QcycggWU,"The russian invaders now actively use the Starlink system. The evidences are plentiful.

Elon Musk continuously repeats Kremlin's narrative.

Elon mocks Ukraine and Ukrainians. Makes fun of their sufferings.

SpaceX and Elon has limited Ukraine's use of Starlink.

It all show that SpaceX is on the wrong side of history. Disgusting."
1172,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for excellent explanation.
1173,qs2QcycggWU,"Will starlink proceed for duplex communication , if possible in future?"
1174,qs2QcycggWU,No acts that would potentially murder or over harm someone
1175,qs2QcycggWU,Devices order arrangements picture formations
1176,qs2QcycggWU,With assistance

1178,qs2QcycggWU,Do not mis use my godts of technology government your stopping now overpy populating kigs and God's or goddess or angels and sheilds or cops or firefighters
1179,qs2QcycggWU,This right is the WiFi well connected talk
1180,qs2QcycggWU,Respect 🧐🤯💯👏
1181,qs2QcycggWU,😢 not to the stars 😢
1182,qs2QcycggWU,"theoretically. in practise, however, belief and more theories."
1183,qs2QcycggWU,Is the satellite only communicating with one dishy at a time? If it’s communicating with multiple dishy’s how does it not “confuse” the different information each dishy “wants”?
1184,qs2QcycggWU,When I watch this on 1.25x and return on normal it felt slower yeah it slower but its fels more slow befor i change the sped to 1.25x
1185,qs2QcycggWU,I have no words to describe the quality and the depth of knowledge that this video provides! I wish I had such a source of material during my graduation.
1186,qs2QcycggWU,Where can I find the creators comments?
1187,qs2QcycggWU,14:50 I need a source to deep dive this. Can't find anything that would confirm such incredible gain. From my experience it should be less than 1280.
1188,qs2QcycggWU,I really wish there was a document with all the text from the canadian subtitles. It is so inconvenient to read.
1189,qs2QcycggWU,wow
1190,qs2QcycggWU,What is the border frequency for electricity to charge the antenna?
1191,qs2QcycggWU,Good tecnolezi
1192,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, Detailed Video... you deserve a respect."
1193,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative video!

Now I understand now it would work while I am out camping in the middle of nowhere!"
1194,qs2QcycggWU,You just made it all clear. I love the explanation on beamforming using the array. Mind blown.
1195,qs2QcycggWU,Music by? Who is the author of the music?  Name the author so you can find the audio tracks!  Thank you!
1196,qs2QcycggWU,Just awesome
1197,qs2QcycggWU,Slow internet
1198,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive work
1199,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing thank you!
1200,qs2QcycggWU,So phase used for beaming direction and also for bit information. How it can be used at the same time?
1201,qs2QcycggWU,It is nice if how satelite side deal with multiple users and impact of shared bandwidth and satelite - base station connection is explained
1202,qs2QcycggWU,So awesome video! thanks a lot for your effort!
1203,qs2QcycggWU,simply wow
1204,qs2QcycggWU,"Your videos is interesting but, in my oppinion you should add TR subtitle. ❤️🙏"
1205,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. The Technology behind and concepts used in stark-link are explained very well.
1206,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely insane.
1207,qs2QcycggWU,"As a computer engineer, my mind is blown, and I'm also highly fascinated by it.. Questions such as why does this service cost so much, and why is the hardware so expensive are answered by one word... damn!!!"
1208,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful effort.... please makes more videos with such deep explanation on various engineering topics
1209,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing educational video, Thanks for making it."
1210,qs2QcycggWU,2:09 misleading animation. TV satelite orbits with the same angular velocity as Earth and seems to be exactly in the same spot.
1211,qs2QcycggWU,UNIVERSITIES❌YOUTUBE✔
1212,qs2QcycggWU,"This is totally cool tech and a fantastic presentation !

Just sent this video to my sister and nephew who are both “double E’s” to see if they understand this tech. 

Thanks 👊🏽💥🫵🏽"
1213,qs2QcycggWU,"Congratulations on a great educational video! However, I wonder how the problem with the doppler effect and the constant frequency shift is solved?"
1214,qs2QcycggWU,Satellites. It works with satellites.
1215,qs2QcycggWU,"Astonishing,simply astonishing"
1216,qs2QcycggWU,"You have gained a new subscriber for creating such a great video and explaining it in a very great way! you are really the ""Sea of Knowledge"" 💖"
1217,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
1218,qs2QcycggWU,Nightmare for DSO photographers.
1219,qs2QcycggWU,"This channel has to be one of the greatest channels on YouTube. Actually, the best educational content ever created in media.

You don't ever get this level of detail and explanation on a multimillion dollar production on TV."
1220,qs2QcycggWU,"I just got mine today. February 1st 2024. The only internet available for me. I connect a eithernet cord and another router I fix packet loss, lagg, distance and the constant data use from apps like Facebook. I was a field technician for exceed internet. Number 2 in the nation for overall customer satisfaction and quality of work. 1 company owns ground to satellite internet(viasat, wild blue, exceed, hues net, dish network, all the same). 1 company owns ground to substation to satellite (Verizon, comcast, spectrum, firefly, all the same). Starlink is then the conventional service. They used radio waves and made the ""substation"" built into dishy, then moved the whole system alot closer."
1221,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible work, I’m sure it will inspire many people ! 🫶🏻"

1227,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, thanks a lot!"
1228,qs2QcycggWU,aduhh... pusinggg wkwkwkwk
1229,qs2QcycggWU,So each satellite doesn't communicate or transfer data to each other?
1230,qs2QcycggWU,They will later.
1231,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome info!!
1232,qs2QcycggWU,"Is there a version in spanish? this has to be one (among others) that are just brilliant speaking science for everyone, taking so many details and not losing the meaning of ""easy comprehension"", just spectacular... i'd love to put voice to share it in spanish"

1240,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a former engineer who designed mobile phones in Japan. The same passive phased array antenna is used in the AWS SPY-1 radar of the Aegis warship owned by countries such as the United States and Japan. Recently, flat antennas have also been sold for terrestrial television reception.
Digital transmission technologies include binary BPSK, 4-value QPSK, and 64QAM, which adds not only phase but also amplitude, and 256QAM for terrestrial Wi-FI and 5G communications, but if communication conditions are poor, 64QAM is used. It will fall. Maybe 64QAM is the most practical with current technology?
By the way, there is one thing that bothers me. This is a very detailed question, but why are broadcasting and communication satellites orbiting 36,000 km above the equator flying in the opposite direction to the Earth's rotation? It cannot be a geostationary satellite unless it rotates in the same direction and at the same speed as the Earth's rotation. No, I was just a little concerned...

--- 以下、日本語版 ---
日本で携帯電話を設計していた元技術者です。アメリカや日本など各国が持つ Aegis warship の AWS SPY-1レーダー も同じパッシブ・フェーズドアレイ・アンテナが使われています。最近は地上のテレビ受信用として平面アンテナも販売されていますね。
ディジタル伝送技術は2値のBPSK、4値のQPSK、更に位相だけでなく振幅も加えた64QAM、地上のWi-FIや5G通信では256QAMなども実用化されていますが通信状態が悪いと64QAMに落ちてしまいます。現在の技術では64QAMが最も実用的なのかも？
ところで1つだけ気になる点が。非常に細かいことですが、赤道上空3万6千kmを周回する放送や通信用人工衛星が何故地球の自転と逆方向に飛行しているのでしょうか？地球の自転と同一方向、同一速度でなければ静止衛星になりませんよね。いや、少しだけ気になったもので・・・。"
1241,qs2QcycggWU,You showed tv satellites moving. But they’re geo stationary.
1242,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow Super Best Technology in the world,  need every country  same this Satellite  , Minimum 2 or 3 🌏 Internet  service  very strong with this 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍🏽💯 Absolutely Right🇵🇰🤝🇪🇺🤝🇬🇧🤝🇵🇰🤝🇺🇲🤝🇵🇰🤝🇯🇵🤝🇵🇰🤝🇦🇪🤝🇵🇰🤝🇸🇦🤝🇵🇰🤝🇪🇺🤝🇵🇰🤝🇰🇷🤝🇵🇰🤝🇧🇭🤝🇵🇰🤝🇮🇳🤝🇵🇰🤝🇪🇺👌"

1253,qs2QcycggWU,I went straight for 2x 😂
1254,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink have to replace 25000 satellites every few years. Viasat has 3 satellites that covers the entire world and don't need replacement every few years
1255,qs2QcycggWU,"unlucky for them, they don't have their own rockets; not a problem for Starlink LOL"
1256,qs2QcycggWU,comm
1257,qs2QcycggWU,Very very nice 👌 internet
1258,qs2QcycggWU,*not very well*
1259,qs2QcycggWU,So simple even a cave man can do it.

1268,qs2QcycggWU,Elon musk and his team are extremely genius! they are like Super duper Human
1269,qs2QcycggWU,nice
1270,qs2QcycggWU,"News flash… it works because it is a ground based technology, that has been around for a very very long time. Elon was offered access to sell this tech because the move to cellular digital access has made this less and less relevant. They took this failing tech and found a way to make it profitable again, by tying it into fake “outer-space”"
1271,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content. Keep it up.
1272,qs2QcycggWU,And they can gather your data whenever they want in real time
1273,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for the brilliant work, keep doing videos please"
1274,qs2QcycggWU,How much are they paying the transmitter?

1287,qs2QcycggWU,In just 2 of your videos I have a level of understanding about electromagnetic waves and how it drives our most advanced technology than I ever thought was possible.  I just assumed some concepts were beyond my ability to comprehend. Turns out the quality of the teacher is as important to our ability to learn as the amount of effort we put into it. I cant believe I understand this! Thanks for expanding my horizon!

If we struggle to understand what is there, - how new ""alien"" technologies we would be able to comprehend? It is almost impossible. Even if aliens gonna give detaild blueprints, - we still gonna struggle to make it work. I am curious, - where did Musk and starlink took that tech from? Was this idea developed by any chance by Soviet Union scientists sometime in 1969? 😀"

1308,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn, this instantly earned you my Subscribe button! Amazing work!"
1309,qs2QcycggWU,The same tech is used for ultrasound inspection in the hospital or on metal welds for non destructive testing.
1310,qs2QcycggWU,on the graphics tv satellite should move together with the earth since they are on Geostationary orbit :)
1311,qs2QcycggWU,I want more and I want it now
1312,qs2QcycggWU,How many antennas are there in one sub-array of a satellite?
1313,qs2QcycggWU,starlink is a tesla in cold weather.
1314,qs2QcycggWU,"This animation are very explanatory, thank you"
1315,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing!
1316,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
1317,qs2QcycggWU,Why cannot dish also revolves as sattelite revolves? Why does dish has to be static?
1318,qs2QcycggWU,excelente🔥📡
1319,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
1320,qs2QcycggWU,"This video was nothing short of incredible, the explanation and animation made it understandable…. Some parts still went over my head lol.

1326,qs2QcycggWU,How does the signal received/transmitted connect to the internet?
1327,qs2QcycggWU,Its works by beaming cancer down to everywhere on the planet. Elon is also wef
1328,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing video! Im so happy youtube recommended me this
1329,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation!!!❤ Thank you!
1330,qs2QcycggWU,It works by sucking $120 a month from your bank account
1331,qs2QcycggWU,"If each bit of 64QAM is transmitted by changing the phase and amplitude, doesnt that disturb the constructive interference of the beam? How can you change the phase of one and not the other?"
1332,qs2QcycggWU,cool
1333,qs2QcycggWU,You have not mentioned the power in milli watts the antenna sends the signals.

1351,qs2QcycggWU,Danke!
1352,qs2QcycggWU,"While all the boobs are heaping praise on the technological prowess on display here, will no one point out the long term space polution that this brings about???
The goal is 40,000 satellites in the strings in low earth orbit that will need to be replaced in 4 to 5 years creating a massive ""junk belt"" of defunct equipment falsely claimed to be self-cleaning...
The claim is that they will de-orbit on their own and solve that conundrum, but the ones that died prematurely are still 'stuck' in orbit...thereby proving false that claim...
It has neen projected that at some point in the near future, it will be too dangerous to send a launch vehicle up in space because of the inevitable damage a collision will cause...
IS THIS THE TECHNICAL MARVEL YOU ALL CAN'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT??
REALLY?"
1353,qs2QcycggWU,Simply brilliant work.
1354,qs2QcycggWU,"Other than general knowledge, I don’t know.  But I’ve had mine up and running for a week.  Honestly, I’m happy as can be with it.  I’m getting over 200M with it though the numbers vary.  My cable company was rationing me 8M over a copper line and charging an outrageous amount of money.  It certainly works for me."

1375,qs2QcycggWU,I worked on law enforcement radio equipment 20 years ago and thought I had a good grasp on most of the basics. This blew my mind!
1376,qs2QcycggWU,You actually talked about general knowledge about phased array antennas instead of focusing on the actual statlink technology such as whether it uses FDMA or TDMA and the ISL communication between satellites and what routing protocols are used to send end-to-end data packets..

1382,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for explaining and visualize nicely
1383,qs2QcycggWU,The amount of knowledge and design put into this tech just terrifies me in a sense that i understand how extremely complex each concepts presented/applied in here. This is literally human sorcery.

1388,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant.....just brilliant!
1389,qs2QcycggWU,"Very captivating! However, i'm curious, if singal intensity is changed during different phase shift or not. If yes, then how its incorporated into tenchology."
1390,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for making this video
1391,qs2QcycggWU,Superb Video for Starlink Satellite Working Phenomanan
1392,qs2QcycggWU,watching this using starlink from the middle of the ocean 😅
1393,qs2QcycggWU,"All clear and perfectly understood... yeahhh, of course 😏"
1394,qs2QcycggWU,"With my degree in physics, all the concepts are pretty natural and intuitive for me, but my mind is still blown to realize that some engineers and technicians actually made it real, and error proof, and commercialized it! And as a teacher, I can still say that you did an amazing job explaining how these things work. Great job, and thank you!"
1395,qs2QcycggWU,"I agree, as an engineer the concepts used are very familiar. Got a chance of use a dish last week in the middle of nowhere and it blew my mind. Its crazy how long we have evolved in the past years where we SMS was mindblowing."
1396,qs2QcycggWU,Give God the Glory great things he has done!
1397,qs2QcycggWU,"An electronics engineer, all of these technology, physics and protocols are familiar to me and very intuitive, even mathematics in physics level. But the amount of technical math to pull this off is an I don't fucking know how. To have this precision is god stuff but it's only one of these technologies."
1398,qs2QcycggWU,"As a software engineer, I am also understand most of the concepts behind this. The systems is indeed mind-boggling. From coding algorithms for satellite communication to ensuring seamless integration with ground stations and user terminals, the technical challenges involved in building and maintaining a network like Starlink are immense."
1399,qs2QcycggWU,"As an economist, I am just blown and none of it was intuitive. I think we should lower the interest rates to boost production of such products."

What a childish perspective. We need quality teachers to help instruct those who are out there doing. If you actually believe what you just said, you probably have some growing up to do. How dare you insult educators. I’ve had more than a few teachers in grade school and professors in college help shape my career trajectory. Maybe it’s time to take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself, “Do I need to be a piece of chit to feel better about myself?”"
1411,qs2QcycggWU,"why does everyone needs some degree to understand this? i never even went to college, yet all of this is common sense to me.
i've understood beamforming since i was like 6-8 years old maybe. i would have used exact same explanation as him bringing ocean waves as example. it's so easy to understand, this doesn't only work with radiowaves, but with everything else aswell. things cancel / push eachother around in entire universe.

i always say that in order to make something, you just have to understand how universe works. once you understand basics how particles move, you can manipulate them.

most fascinating thing to me, is how all this fits together. i understand the entire process and i can explain it, but if i'd have to build it out of scratch, not so sure if i could do it. it would take me years of testing."
1412,qs2QcycggWU,amazing stuff. Mankind can be so smart. But unfortunately also infinite dumb
1413,qs2QcycggWU,"Nevermind Starlink, just imagine the tech this guy is going to put his name too and claim proffit from! Imagine everything Nasa invented or patented because of the space race back in the day!! then just think this guy is getting his grubby mits on all of it."
1414,qs2QcycggWU,Again: What a wonderful peace of engineering art!
1415,qs2QcycggWU,This is the epitome of YouTube. The fact that such high quality educational content is free is one of the few things that give me hope that technology and understating is the true epitome of  research of advancement in society.
1416,qs2QcycggWU,My thoughts exactly. As much as it’s been polluted by garbaj 2+2=5 nonsense there is stuff like this that shines through and gives hope
1417,qs2QcycggWU,We need more videos like these for our children and less garbage on YouTube.
1418,qs2QcycggWU,GREAT VIDEO! Hope you guys can monetize with it.
1419,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink must use 1 antennas with 10 types of small rabbit antennas from 20 ghz to 120 ghz to improve the speed. It must improve many things that fail on earth such as walls or interference in the sky, passing through building walls or 10 floors underground. Clearly, cybersecurity must be elementary, achieving better logistics and greater speeds every day until next-generation internet networks."
1420,qs2QcycggWU,this is amazing
1421,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlight Internet Work? The same way the phoney satellites in orbit works. It doesn't exist. It only still exists from the ground sites like always until the lies and CGI came out just like the false moon landings, ISS. It's magical."

1433,qs2QcycggWU,I love technique and your channel. Everything is so aweome. Thanks
1434,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah I was about to ask ""But where does the cancelled waves really go?"", but then came ""the short explanationion....""
I haven't asked this question in all of my time being curious about physics, but today it just presented itself to me."
1435,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks 😊 thats was really imformative❤
1436,qs2QcycggWU,"The development is so fast, this narrative is way out of date and actally misleading to people starting to participate
Watch instead to JCristina who is actually a real help.."
1437,qs2QcycggWU,incredible animations
1438,qs2QcycggWU,Lets spy the woods now
1439,qs2QcycggWU,Commenting for the algorithm
1440,qs2QcycggWU,Now imagine trying to explain all of this information to a Victorian era physicist
1441,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing service you're providing! I'm doing my best to get our younger generation excited by these videos!! Thank you!!!
1442,qs2QcycggWU,11:34 polzarization  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1443,qs2QcycggWU,(not that funny)
1444,qs2QcycggWU,is it a typo or am I just bad at english?
1445,qs2QcycggWU,SO ELON MUSK IS ROBBING THE WORLD THROUGH SATELLITE.
1446,qs2QcycggWU,How the heck did people figure this out...
1447,qs2QcycggWU,"I want to say this must be how school lesson are made for children .. but it would be a torturing boring long lesson for the ones who are not interested . And that is the greatness of the Internet where everyone takes what they're interested in



There must global effort to support this kind of work .. while the globe is currently overwhelmed by gaming , entertainment , plus meaningless and valueless and countless jobs that I can't even remember"
1448,qs2QcycggWU,"No words ! 
I don't understand most of this .. but it's just fascinating !!!!! 
People in the comments said it well
This quality !
these huge efforts ! 
No appreciation is enough 

Hundreds of hours in researching and gathering information 
Scripting and huge efforts on the language .. clear explanation
Visualization .. no words 

Insane quality of information , visuals and language used 
And free on youtube .. INSANE !!!
Even highly expensive content is not that quality
No appreciation is enough"
1449,qs2QcycggWU,"22:22 , my mind is blown .. 
please make more videos .."
1450,qs2QcycggWU,It's Musk so it must be magic.

1460,qs2QcycggWU,"Why foreign references to speed, distance and narration in English? Stupid, and a waste of time to watch."
1461,qs2QcycggWU,Incredibly Amazing ....
1462,qs2QcycggWU,"This is insane! Technology these days is mind boggling. How people come up with this stuff… wow! If you showed people this tech 50 years ago, hell, even 30 years ago they would be shocked! Makes you wonder what things will be like 100 years from now!"
1463,qs2QcycggWU,Wao!!
1464,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome 👍👍
1465,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the information.
1466,qs2QcycggWU,Danke!
1467,qs2QcycggWU,I don't understand that you're only getting a hundred megabytes per second let's say you have four people in the house two of them are playing the game one of them is surfing the other ones watching YouTube that will completely slow you down. I deal with fiber with three gigabytes per second that is 10 times faster than the starlink. I don't understand how Mr.Musk gets better when you get fiber that goes 10 times faster.
1468,qs2QcycggWU,It utilizes electron beams from Elon’s brain to power X😊
1469,qs2QcycggWU,"Antena Starlinka jest dużo bardziej złożona niż opisałeś to w filmie. 
Antena satelitarna to blaszany talerz skupiający odbite fale radiowe w jednym punkcie, antena Starlinka to płyta z ponad 1200ma ""małymi antenkami"", a do każdej z nich sygnał jest doprowadzany oddzielnie.
Mechaniczne ustawienie anteny Starlink następuje zaraz po uruchomieniu. Potem antena zatrzymuje się, a jednak przez cały czas „śledzi” ruchome satelity przelatujące na niebie. To, ile i jak szybko przemieszczających się satelitów musi „gonić” antena widać, gdy obserwujemy je w nocy. Gdyby dla takich ruchomych satelitów zastosować „zwykły” talerz trzeba by nieustannie mechaniczne obracać go w kierunku satelity, a gdy satelita zniknie za horyzontem szybko szukać kolejnego (i w tym czasie mielibyśmy przerwę w transmisji).
Natomiast antena Starlink kieruje wiązkę radiową w kierunku ruchomego satelity cyfrowo. Jeśli ktoś jest bardziej zainteresowany jak się to dzieje polecam film na YT: „How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work?”."
1470,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of this video is off the charts ❤
1471,qs2QcycggWU,Very smart.

1484,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing
1485,qs2QcycggWU,Sorry but I think life was better before the internet 😂
1486,qs2QcycggWU,Yet here you are...
1487,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JJFlores197 😂 true enough! But I see my town centre shops closing down, the bank will close soon, the supermarket uses self checkouts more than staffed channels which keep people in work, the kids are addicted to their phones & don’t play outside like we used to, there’s a high risk of online fraud…I could go on and on!
So I do think life was more wholesome before the internet arrived,.

1538,qs2QcycggWU,"There's something that I don't understand of missing. If you need to select the phases of the signals sent out for Phase Array Beam Steering, then how do you also at the same time manage to vary the same phases (alongside amplitudes) to assign them to 6-bit binary values?"
1539,qs2QcycggWU,"On one hand, it's a tech disruption to all those companies/countries laying miles of fiber optical network cables out there, and on the other, a global private network of Intelligence, Surveillance,Reconnaissance, secure data transmission to all global aerial, naval, ground Military Assets/Bases around the world to enhance USA's capability of existing constellation of military satellites to ensure survivability in the case of war! 
So Space X, seems like the private arm of US space force! And Musk's AI company will have lot of military application/potential as well. Already, twitter has been used as a propaganda platform throughout the world by western powers for quite some time and simply changing the name  to X won't make any difference."

1545,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blown.


Saw this video on Roku. Had to comment my appreciation for the research and work that went into this. Thank you."
1546,qs2QcycggWU,"I want to say that the quality of this video blows my mind. i am glad to see that there are still channels focused on informing the viewers. not only that but really going deep on the subject matter. So for that alone, I thank you. I also want to thank you for the hard work you did in animating the video so that the complex things you were talking about had a very high quality visual aid, that helped immensely to allow what was being said to be comprehended and retained. The script was amazing also."
1547,qs2QcycggWU,"Theres something about, a narrator that has the voice of a serious movie announcer, saying Dishy Mcflat face, that makes me laugh."
1548,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. You are extraordinary. I don’t get impressed easy but you managed to do so. Impeccable.
1549,qs2QcycggWU,How does a Starlink satellite handle thousands of dishy data beam simultaneously?
1550,qs2QcycggWU,This video is mad..
1551,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video thank you
1552,qs2QcycggWU,only just found this - brilliant video - i'm a retired telecoms engineer and didn't know most of this content!!! - modern compute and comms tech is getting really close to magic now!!!

1571,qs2QcycggWU,India
1572,qs2QcycggWU,Just amazing
1573,qs2QcycggWU,i have one question why is there no satellite flying above the north and south pole as i have seen in the video ? Thanks for answering my question.
1574,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
1575,qs2QcycggWU,3:37 I have Dishy Mc Flatface. Those motors move Dishy to align with the satellites for the initial setup but also move to align with other satellites from time to time.

1584,qs2QcycggWU,👏👏👏👏
1585,qs2QcycggWU,I love these videos
1586,qs2QcycggWU,How is the fidelity of the the binary code sent in the 64QAM maintained with the constructive interference of the beam formers? Is there a demodulation process occurring at the StarLink satellite?
1587,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks you for working hard to bring this to us
1588,qs2QcycggWU,13:30 this amazing graphic/animation showing the field of radiation (including the circular polarizatiton !!! ) earned you my subscription. AMAZING ! I think the circular polarization is producing Tesla's longitudinal waves. THAT is why the connection round trip is so fast. They are manufactureing an entire sky antenna interface to the global computer-net that is based on tortion physics. The circular polarization between two oppositely poled emitters produces a tortion field. There is more here than meets the eye.
1589,qs2QcycggWU,Proper and in depth explanation thanks
1590,qs2QcycggWU,Incrediblely detailed....

1603,qs2QcycggWU,Dayum
1604,qs2QcycggWU,Excelente video y explicación. Por más videos como este dejo este comentario. Saludos. Mariano
1605,qs2QcycggWU,"The video was indeed the most informative video I’ve ever seen in my life. Still I wanted to become software engineer or a electronics and communication technology. But I couldn’t so the point the question which I wanted to ask is will these Starlin satellites affect the rockets or this or the satellites or the space exploration which are done by different countries all over the world because if 10,000 satellites are present in our lower earth orbit, then they might block the space area which could be detrimental in launching or sending any other satellites or rockets to the space, how will it be handle because my question is will be satellites not affecting the entire space eco ecosystem. I just wanted to know how space link will deal with these problems and how these satellites will be fixed if any problem occurs in them or will they be brought back to the earth surface and after repair they will be placed into their referred orbit"
1606,qs2QcycggWU,"As soon as more than 50,000 people get this it will be as slow as all the other internet providers. LOL  Aelon just snake oiled you to part with more dollar than any other internet provider"
1607,qs2QcycggWU,LIARS  no satellites exist
1608,qs2QcycggWU,Bro u should make next video on nasa space station ❤
1609,qs2QcycggWU,@elonmuskceospaceX you r not Elon buddy 😏
1610,qs2QcycggWU,After intelligence comes madness
1611,qs2QcycggWU,👍
1612,qs2QcycggWU,As I utilize my Starlink right now.  But fok adjust the price per month from 140 to i dunno… 100$
1613,qs2QcycggWU,"How does starlink work?

Poorly."
1614,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy McFlatFace's father was born in 1980, and resides in Bourne Massachusetts. His name is PAV PAWS and works on Flatrock Hill. He works as a custodian of the skies, by using a broom that sweeps a wide path of electrostatic electricity which inverts to a spike from massive, phased-array antennas that become axially aligned with the motion-vector of an incoming missile. The premises are more recently named space force."
1615,qs2QcycggWU,Stunning video!!! Really enjoyed it.
1616,qs2QcycggWU,Cool
1617,qs2QcycggWU,very cool
1618,qs2QcycggWU,This is fantastic
1619,qs2QcycggWU,For the most part....it doesn't work! lol oh and Over Priced
1620,qs2QcycggWU,"If the dish receives the exact coordinates of the satellites via software and aligns itself accordingly using the hardware, how does this work the other way around with the satellite so that the wave signals from the satellite combine exactly on my dish? How does the satellite hardware align itself with millions of different targets?"
1621,qs2QcycggWU,"It is mind-blowing how satelite ""have time"" to receive and deliver large amount of data to millions of users with no ""mixing"" data :)"
1622,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, Thank you"
1623,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Good work!
1624,qs2QcycggWU,"Well done , looking forward to your additional videos"
1625,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for a great video. Only unanswered question to me is why there are arrays of satellites.
1626,qs2QcycggWU,one of the best pages to explain electronic tech to mech engineers like myself!!! keep it up guys...
1627,qs2QcycggWU,TV satellites? Your graphic shows these moving relative to the earth's surface with a fixed ground dish. You lost me right there. Pseudoscience. Move on everyone.
1628,qs2QcycggWU,"In the beginning of this video, video satellite (TV) is compared with Starlink's Internet. Why not compare HughesNet with Stalink🤔"
1629,qs2QcycggWU,True meaning of upload / download
1630,qs2QcycggWU,very informative
1631,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
1632,qs2QcycggWU,"A big thanks to the creators. It was like revisiting 3 years on engineering studies within 25 mins, rather in a more lucid way."
1633,qs2QcycggWU,you got me hooked when u say watch it first at 1.25 and thena gain at 1.5
1634,qs2QcycggWU,Bro this is too deep for my layman head
1635,qs2QcycggWU,You mean how Starlink doesn't work... Very expensive and buggy
1636,qs2QcycggWU,Most well spend 30mins of my life. This is astonishing and great thanks to Branch Education for bringing this content.
1637,qs2QcycggWU,"I gave a thumbs up, I'm subscribed, and this is my comment. Hoping I see many more of your videos.

1644,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely excellent video.
1645,qs2QcycggWU,correction - mid flight wifi never works!
1646,qs2QcycggWU,I was thinking of building my own satellite for personal internet. You’ve made my job easier!
1647,qs2QcycggWU,Watching on dishy Ontario Canada
1648,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder if this can  be used for 600 kilohertz to 500 megahertz. I bet it is only good for the gigahertz's band to bad it cant be used in the HAM radio bands HF VHF UHF VLF.
1649,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the knowledge 🎉❤
1650,qs2QcycggWU,"One question: if a TV satellite can't send data then how do they detect how many people watch their programs, ads, and from where people watch their programs? Because they collect this information"
1651,qs2QcycggWU,in some sat-TVs there is a device that connects to the cellular networks to transmit these information.
1652,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine if we could receive and decode all those electric waves by our heads 😂 everyone was talking like a TV that you can't turn off. Of course we are affected by those waves a little bit every year because those waves pass through our body and our body responds to those waves but we don't feel them.
1653,qs2QcycggWU,Great content. creating useful contents takes a lot of hard work.
1654,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation 😮
1655,qs2QcycggWU,I am blown indeed. Great job👏👏👏
1656,qs2QcycggWU,👌🆙️
1657,qs2QcycggWU,"outstanding work guys! the effort from the Branch Education team is greatly appreciated by thousands! thanks for making a smarter world, god knows we need it! those tiktokers are draing our children´s brain"
1658,qs2QcycggWU,awesome explanation! loved the quite somehow deep look into QAM
1659,qs2QcycggWU,"woooow 😯😯 that's  amazing
thankyou very very much"
1660,qs2QcycggWU,God level explanation.
1661,qs2QcycggWU,"Creating the technology is one thing, but being able to explain the theory to people without a physics background is another level of comprehension. The illustrations are extremely well-done 🤯"
1662,qs2QcycggWU,This is an amazing video..... thanks for the effort of the team!!! Great work!!!
1663,qs2QcycggWU,I don't get it can you explain it again please
1664,qs2QcycggWU,you guys almost made me feel guilty about using an adblocker almost lol great vid def gonna check more out could def do a couple more ad reads i dont think people would mind with this level of content reminds me of the awesome How its made show back when i was growing up.
1665,qs2QcycggWU,Very good
1666,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Explanation
1667,qs2QcycggWU,22:51 I just went here to understand how the satellites keep in orbit and adjust their angle down to Earth… (probably had to look at the chapters first) */ok the answer is krypton ion engines*
1668,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
1669,qs2QcycggWU,"holyfucking shit this was the most knowledgeable video ive ever witnessed on YouTube , Thanks alot for your dedication"
1670,qs2QcycggWU,👌👌👌
1671,qs2QcycggWU,"Geek Wire article from last year: SpaceX says that most of the satellites it launched last week for its Starlink broadband internet constellation are doomed to fall from orbit due to a solar storm.

Based on the company’s analysis, as many as 40 of the 49 satellites — which were built at SpaceX’s facility in Redmond, Wash. — will plunge through the atmosphere and burn up. Some have already made the plunge."
1672,qs2QcycggWU,? respected great Elon Musk starlink team my question is what happened starlink dish intina beam between plan & others crush to inteana starlight
1673,qs2QcycggWU,this is mind blowing? how can black people surpass whites?!

1685,qs2QcycggWU,"I am amazed and blown away by the level of electronic technology as explained in this video.  I had an intense interest in electronics since I was a boy - first, building a crystal radio from a kit and then many more from scratch for my friends.  (they called me 'Brainwave')  Later on I built many more electronic projects first with tubes and later with transistors.  I grew up on a farm and was destined to be a farmer but my interest in electronics eventually led me to a career in mainframe computers starting in 1965.  And of course, I built my first personal computer from a magazine article around 1975.  Over the years I have gained a very good understanding of how radio and TV work, and the learned about computers from the ground up as I started my career as a field technician - installing and maintaining mainframe computers.  So my understanding and knowledge of electronic technology now also included the digital realm.  I am now 83 years old and many years retired and no longer in touch with the latest and greatest.  So it was most rewarding to come across this video and the clear explanation of the workings of modern satellite technology.  Thank you."

1689,qs2QcycggWU,Slavery.
1690,qs2QcycggWU,Me wanty the long explanations!
1691,qs2QcycggWU,"wow, this is so amazing and mind-blowing. Thanks so much for your sharing the knowledge !"
1692,qs2QcycggWU,That deserves a gold 🌟
1693,qs2QcycggWU,Wow totally amazing while I amAble to understand the concepts for my math and physics courses it is totally amazing!
1694,qs2QcycggWU,"that's amazing how much process it had to go thru, not sure if the copper is the way to go. will see down the line in the future"
1695,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative and an excellent way to explain a complex technology. I used to work on phased arrays in underwater acoustics, mainly how to adaptively adjust the beam patterns to minimize the effects of ambient noise and interferences using minimum variance distortionless look (MVDR) calculations.  I wonder if such methods are planned for future upgrades?"
1696,qs2QcycggWU,"Man.

We oughta buy these things so easily not knowing the complexity of which they were made.
Thanks. 28mins was all worth it. 

GEEZZZZ"
1697,qs2QcycggWU,Max innovation...thanks  elon
1698,qs2QcycggWU,Loved the video and love the channel!!!
1699,qs2QcycggWU,"12 Megahertz affects Hearing in humans and causes an imbalance of Amino Acids in neurotransmitters of the human brain; A decrease in the concentration of a limiting amino acid in specific regions of the brain is followed by behavioral effects, especially a decrease in feed intake (Gietzen, 1993)."
1700,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing! Too much for my brain to handle.
1701,qs2QcycggWU,"What's going to happen when 100 different companies all want 10,000+ satellites up in space? We'll need the satellites to be treated like a utility, where competitors have to share them so that we're not just clogging up space with redundant satellites."
1702,qs2QcycggWU,"Elon musk is a fraud, with dictator narcissistic behavior. He is just another Elizabeth Holmes"
1703,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, a old thing with new faster signals that can track, follow and control people even more. Idiots"
1704,qs2QcycggWU,just three words YOU ARE LEGEND ❤
1705,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent, but the brilliant sponsor section praising elon musk probably didn't age terribly well..."
1706,qs2QcycggWU,"Stunning graphics, and a surprisingly clear explanation for such a complicated topic. Thank you!

I'm confused how info is reliably transmitted via phase shift. Iiuc, phase shift is relative ie if I'm sending a continuous signal and you pick it up midstream, you couldn't determine the phase shift, could you? Seems like the phase shift info is only apparent at the moment one symbol switches to another so if there's any hiccup at that point in time, some info would be lost. Maybe the phase is compared against a super accurate clock?"
1707,qs2QcycggWU,"does doppler affect how the signals are processed? I imagine the waves reaching the satellite are shifted when it is approaching or leaving the field of view of the antennas right? Also, what are the main differences between the circular and rectangular versions of the dishes?"
1708,qs2QcycggWU,"What an amazing explainer. Thank you for this video. Great explainer, amazing graphic animation, brilliant educational content overall. So impressed. You’ve earned a follower. Keep up the good work mate. Cheers."
1709,qs2QcycggWU,I wish I could join this channel one day
1710,qs2QcycggWU,Love it♥
1711,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for this
1712,qs2QcycggWU,how does it work? well first they convince you that musk is a genius then they sucker you into dropping 2 grand to buy THEIR equipment so they can lock you into needing them and give you substandard connection and speed... any questions?
1713,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah this is insane, please make more!"
1714,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
1715,qs2QcycggWU,We are understanding high complex technology in a very simple language. Thanks for sharing this informational video for everyone.
1716,qs2QcycggWU,Just want to know how much they charge
1717,qs2QcycggWU,"Last I remember, the service cost $100 USD/month and the equipment was a 1-time payment of around $400-$500."
1718,qs2QcycggWU,"Quick question, however, the Starlink DOES move throughout the day and time. You stated it is only moved at setup but that is not true. Why?"
1719,qs2QcycggWU,Worth it
1720,qs2QcycggWU,This is astonishing
1721,qs2QcycggWU,"awsomne! liek  iknow its always crazy when you put it in perspective, and we take it for granteds, but its such a large part of my education and its sooooooooooooooo insanely amazing i love it hah"
1722,qs2QcycggWU,"white man got brains, how did they think of such and came up with such stuff"
1723,qs2QcycggWU,Well done
1724,qs2QcycggWU,This video is sick

My quickest subscribe ever! Amazing work. Thanks👍🏼"
1727,qs2QcycggWU,Elegantly explained. Thanks. Watching just once is enough if you have understanding of underlying subjects.
1728,qs2QcycggWU,Yikes this is futurist. Just like when I watched my first CGI video..
1729,qs2QcycggWU,The unreal detail and sheer effort that this took to create doesn't go unnoticed. Thank you.
1730,qs2QcycggWU,interesting!

1737,qs2QcycggWU,wow...never ever thought anyone could explain such complexity by animation to such degree of simplify understanding. really awsome work and effort ! you folks can probly explain justa bout anything to a common person.
1738,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely great animation
1739,qs2QcycggWU,"I understand how it work.
But i dont understand how they can send Gigabyte or terabyte of data per second with that thing."
1740,qs2QcycggWU,great video!
1741,qs2QcycggWU,WOOOOW amazing video thankx
1742,qs2QcycggWU,Love your videos! You are teaching everything the way I Learn!
1743,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for a really good video lesson.  I learnt a lot and appreciate all the great efforts made into creating it.   I will refer to this video in my future lectures for communication engineers.  

May I humbly suggest one improvement.  Your TV satellite graphic animation seems erratic.  They should circle the earth in a geosynchronous manner, i.e., the angular rotation speed of the satellite is exactly the same as the earth rotation so that at any point on earth, we can find the geostationary satellite at a fixed angle.  Some correction in the animation will help viewers understand better."
1744,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best channel for education and visualization of current technology. Keep up the great work
1745,qs2QcycggWU,Not very well.
1746,qs2QcycggWU,"1st video from this Channel, definitely Loved.they take their time to explain how Startlink work rather than finishing it in 7 or 8 minutes also they Taught many small concepts from base within seconds to understand next process also animations of everything are just awesome like phase difference, wave front and Wave interference and Amplitude and Phrase Modulation, topics that never understand from ncert which your animations explained so easily under 5 to 10 seconds.
Loved it❤.
Definitely going to explore your channel after writing this comment.

1775,qs2QcycggWU,"What a brilliant idea to provide internet world wide anytime anywhere. However, i wonder would it be the down link beams intense that comes from the satellite harmful form human due to its vertical direction unlike the earth microwave dishes that are horizontal pointed on the BTS? 
Who will be responsible if the world got effected with cancers diseases as a result of this technology ????"
1776,qs2QcycggWU,"i thought phase was used to steer the beam to follow the satellite, so how can it also be modulated to trasmit the signal?"
1777,qs2QcycggWU,wow!
1778,qs2QcycggWU,Thankyou for this wonderful thought provoking video regarding starlink .
1779,qs2QcycggWU,Thats bull
1780,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Thank you !
1781,qs2QcycggWU,The scale of this video gave me an existential crisis and the sudden realization of how useless I am compared to some individuals on this planet.
1782,qs2QcycggWU,"How about to made such a great animation and explanation of MRI works? Deep into magnetic, electric, chemical elements, protons and so. Very large ocean of technologies"
1783,qs2QcycggWU,i have seen Startlink and its satelites in a line cross the sky.  Once they are gone and on the other side of the earth what happens to your signal?
1784,qs2QcycggWU,I'm watching this at 2x speed wishing I could watch it at 5x speed.
1785,qs2QcycggWU,"The video is mind blowing good job!!!!!
I have a doubt when you modify the amplitude and phase to send the data does not affect the direction of the signal?"
1786,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, I started wondering how much work went into making this video, early on. I work in the entertainment field so naturally I thought about it"

1792,qs2QcycggWU,Nice explanation.. Ructc?
1793,qs2QcycggWU,Here's my comment...I love these guys when it came to the math part they said let's move on....LoL
1794,qs2QcycggWU,"@BranchEducation, I observed our Dishy changed its rotation and angle each night while at a beach on the West Coast. It would move from W to NW. I’m presuming this happens because the satellites are outside the 100° window. Does this sound logical?"
1795,qs2QcycggWU,"""Going from positive to negative and back to positive once every 83 pico seconds""...






That sounds similar to my mental health only way faster! :| Lol"

1804,qs2QcycggWU,"In the beginning of the video you show a tv satellite orbiting earth, in reality these satellites are geosynchronous or ""parked"" in a specific point above earth.  They orbit the same speed as earth rotates.  The satellite dish on your house simply amplifies the signal it receives from the tv satellite, not nearly as sophisticated as Starlink."
1805,qs2QcycggWU,"I can honestly say that there was not one single descriptive detail regarding the internal components of a starlite sat. at any part within this entire video that I didn’t fully comprehend & understand as to it’s function, purpose or it’s singular definition unto itself. 
 In other words; I am quite obviously & clearly: “f.o.s.” (ull f hit)"
1806,qs2QcycggWU,VERY GOOOOD
1807,qs2QcycggWU,Small nitpick I have: your graphics show the geostationary satellites orbiting opposite to earths rotation which is wrong
1808,qs2QcycggWU,I have a question that is probably beyond the scope of this EXCELLENT video. If phase shifting is used for beam steering how is it also used to encode the six bits in the h.264 codec? Is the phase shift the shift to steer the beam in the signal completely separate from the phase shift of the EM wave (photos?) itself? Forgive my ignorance. Thank you so much.
1809,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for very detailed explanation.
1810,qs2QcycggWU,Wow

1816,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder how those satellites don't crash into each other while orbiting earth....
1817,qs2QcycggWU,"So, here's a question: You mentioned that each antenna cannot do full-duplex communication (at about the 10:25 mark), so how does it determine when to rx and when to tx?

Thanks for the video. Due to various career choices, I've worked with small subsets of radio theory all at different points of my life, and never really understood how they interacted. This video essentially forced 10 years of life experience to all exist in the same box for me, lol.
Great work!"

1830,qs2QcycggWU,"Bye healthcare. Speaking of scary AI, i absolutely see an exodus of healthcare workers soon because of it...If you only figure out why the doctors not into torture have left pts worldwide. Usually the people not into torture not also into state and authority resources being used on patients and the population in unforgivable ways but you might have to ask those that are into that for you all , in the future."

1846,qs2QcycggWU,This presentation is also crystal clear that Starlink will succeed in its project.👍
1847,qs2QcycggWU,"_Those little details in the animations that make them technically correct are a HUGE aid to correct understanding. Your animations are far beyond just pretty pictures, and it shows! Your videos are amazingly good at helping engage the next h neration of engineers and scheintists that will hopefully fully make some thing far better than Starlink one day. My deep, deep gratitude and admiration for what you do._"
1848,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video thank you allot for such as, On other hand I've an issue maybe am not full understand, but i'll be grateful if you may help with that. Which is how could this Dishy! How could this technique steering waves to facing starlink satellite and the same time performing a six binary digits groups!? How could that happened without effecting one of them on each other? Where steering processing and producing  symbols(a six binary digits groups) each of them use the signal wave's amplitude and phase."
1849,qs2QcycggWU,If these  people earlier on said they are God we would worship them this is incredible engineering 😮
1850,qs2QcycggWU,Too bad it’s owned by Elon Musk

1864,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent animations behind the theoretical world of physics.
1865,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome !
1866,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
1867,qs2QcycggWU,Awosome but what are the effects
1868,qs2QcycggWU,I am impressed with the Starlink technology and this well done video. Very good job!! Now we need a video on how the Starlink satellites communicate with each other.
1869,qs2QcycggWU,This is so interesting.  I didn't want to miss any second of the vidéo and i didn't.  I wish you guys more success
1870,qs2QcycggWU,Big thanks for explaining modern tech👍
1871,qs2QcycggWU,"Я просто поражён уровнем технологии. Спасибо автором канала за красивую анимацию и  подробный, интересный рассказ."
1872,qs2QcycggWU,Thank God for making smart people because they do things like this.
1873,qs2QcycggWU,❤❤❤😮😮😮
1874,qs2QcycggWU,"The amount of dedication and detail of this video is out of this world, literally a master piece. Thanks."
1875,qs2QcycggWU,Does it not get interrupted by wether like satellite TVs?
1876,qs2QcycggWU,amazing
1877,qs2QcycggWU,🕊❤️🥰🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
1878,qs2QcycggWU,"Came here for a discussion on routing, and got a lesson in RF.  The secret sauce is in the routing."
1879,qs2QcycggWU,lol
1880,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks! This was an absolute wonder of an answer to my questions! I’ll be watching many more.
1881,qs2QcycggWU,Madness.
1882,qs2QcycggWU,Such a good content👌🏻👌🏻
1883,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off  really loved it
1884,qs2QcycggWU,"What a ride! Beautiful graphics! Best of all though is the narrative accompnoment. That guy could sell snow to an Eskimo!  Great material, better still is the presentation. I'm hooked after trying to digest just a couple shows! Truly a gift ...."
1885,qs2QcycggWU,nice!
1886,qs2QcycggWU,excelent
1887,qs2QcycggWU,"A nice video, just the H.264 was a bit off. There are many video codecs (and better ones), for example for me this video was using AV1."
1888,qs2QcycggWU,"The ""creators comments"" subtitles are such a genius idea, and it gives me an incentive to watch the video twice, absolutely genius and awesome"
1889,qs2QcycggWU,You're going to have to make a new video with the new Starlink optical laser systems.
1890,qs2QcycggWU,🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
1891,qs2QcycggWU,I freaking love these videos. I always end them astonished at how complicated simple things can be.
1892,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive
1893,qs2QcycggWU,HOW TO APPLY SIR MAAM.
1894,qs2QcycggWU,👍
1895,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible
1896,qs2QcycggWU,What a video!
1897,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, nothing really is mind-blowing these days anymore. Anyway, it has to be said, this video is  absolutely beautiful, just like all Your videos"
1898,qs2QcycggWU,Very good!
1899,qs2QcycggWU,Just… congrats for the great work!
1900,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a degree in electrical engineering, 1965. I have a PhD in astronomy 1972. I am a science, nerd, forever. So when I say, I learned a lot from this video, I mean, I learned a LOT from this video. I can’t believe that I had no idea how they encoded bits. Everything else was pretty familiar to me. Although it’s amazing to me it took them 50 years to figure out how to do it right. Because we learned this in school when I was a kid. And now I’m 78, but look what they did in 50 years. It’s amazing. I do have a question though. If the encoding of bits involves amplitude of the wave, what happens when there is moisture in the air that varies the absorption. That would change the amplitude of the wave. Perhaps it’s all about being constant over a short period of time like a millisecond."
1901,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm a communications engineer. Weather is certainly a factor in terms of noise that will affect the received bits, but via the use of encoding, there are additional parity and checksum bits which are used to correct previously incorrectly decoded bits. For more information, you can look up information regarding Error Correcting Codes."
1902,qs2QcycggWU,Well done!
1903,qs2QcycggWU,this is cool but I can already see how silly this video will be in 20-30 years. Just  like those 90s videos where they describe the ground breaking future tech that is dial up internet
1904,qs2QcycggWU,From 50% chance of cancer up to 100%
1905,qs2QcycggWU,Why? Please explain. Thanks

The video is 2 hours long and in English.
It starts with an interview of a lieutenant who was a member of a secret air force unit in Alaska in the 50s 60s.
This unit had the task to catch the satellites hanging on parachutes with special airplanes in the air after the balloons had been blown off.

It gets really exciting when you look through the reference list of balloon satellite launches of the Swedish service provider.
Among others, balloon launches for 
MIR 12 balloonlaunches
INMARSAT 2 balloonlaunches
ENVISAT 13 balloonlaunches
NASA > 8 balloonlaunches
And there will be more than one service provider than the Swedes 

In another part you will see how such a satellitelaunch via balloon in Antarctica really happens.

1915,qs2QcycggWU,It's just woooow. Engineering at its best.
1916,qs2QcycggWU,The best video I have seen this month!!
1917,qs2QcycggWU,only troposcater connection
1918,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible explanation
1919,qs2QcycggWU,That's a fine piece of engineering! Excellent video as always!
1920,qs2QcycggWU,BS
1921,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this simplified yet extensive explanation. It is amazing how seemingly basic concepts of physics are put together in such a complex manner to run a sophisticated system, which the user never even realizes when tapping the screen or clicking the mouse...
I wonder how many light years it will take for a far away civilisation to catch some of the electromagnetic waves we've started to emit not too long ago. Will there be any civilisation on our planet by that time???"
1922,qs2QcycggWU,Mite go make myself a nice lan sanswich after that.
1923,qs2QcycggWU,"Goes up and down.
Metal detectecter...
Now contiuasley round and round."
1924,qs2QcycggWU,"A dish is not nessercery when a satelite wants you bad.
They fill you housevwith microwaves,then extract them.
You can see  the imijing on your television,a map.
Park your car like a dick on an angle outside,youll spot it easier"
1925,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for explaining this amazing technology to the public! As a physicist I appreciate your selfless efforts to keep everyone informed as to how amazing science is. This video is 100% facts and all images are real.
1926,qs2QcycggWU,You are not a physicist
1927,qs2QcycggWU,"very good video, it's so easy to learn with videos like these"
1928,qs2QcycggWU,Are Government is up to something they not telling us something 🤔
1929,qs2QcycggWU,❤
1930,qs2QcycggWU,"how technology improved so fast, amazing. what a time to be alive."
1931,qs2QcycggWU,This inspires the study of electrical engineering
1932,qs2QcycggWU,"This is amazing finally founded a favourite show in YouTube thank you , i wonder how do you make the graphics are they already exist and you bought them or you design every animation !!!"
1933,qs2QcycggWU,next
1934,qs2QcycggWU,"I am writing this after 1yr of this video, Starlink did an extra ordinary innovation, but @BranchEducation has created world class video to explain this innovation in amazing animation. Superb work. 👏"
1935,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
1936,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
1937,qs2QcycggWU,This is soo cool. Praise you for sharing this🙏
1938,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
1939,qs2QcycggWU,"Loved the Starlink video , thank you!"
1940,qs2QcycggWU,wow
1941,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice explanation of Antennae theory !
1942,qs2QcycggWU,Calor flof caliksn
1943,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off to this mind blowing technology and all the hard work and efforts your team has putting into. Highest quality and explanation
1944,qs2QcycggWU,When can we expect Starlink in India....
1945,qs2QcycggWU,awesome job. thank you!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1946,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent! thank you for the knowledge!!
1947,qs2QcycggWU,"Too much (pointless)  information! You trying to teach China, Iran, India and N. Korea how to copy it, or what???😮"
1948,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nice explanation, but only if you are actually able to reach into orbit. But of course NASA have been able to do the second best way to boost into orbit by way of CGI. The magical way! Just like NASA is very good Hollywood way!!! They also did the 9/11 towers  the Hollywood way using moving hollowgram pictures of two planes hitting the towers and movie like scenes for the highjacked planes. You know, paid false actors like what happened many times before!!! I guess I can call this comment a believe it or not comment.😭"
1949,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool. Nice job on the explanation. Was very nice to learn and I love how the video and animation was made to show and explain more 👏
1950,qs2QcycggWU,"I have to assume the Branch of Education you're on is NASA and Hollywood. The magic of educations in this world. The same like pharmacies who provides snake oil. A bit of good to intice for the bad to go down smoothly! In the last days, God will send down strong delusions in this world. 😭"
1951,qs2QcycggWU,Exactly the. same way phased array radar
1952,qs2QcycggWU,"This was incredibly well explained, reminded me of the movie ""Passengers"" and the voice explaining how far the ship had really travelled."
1953,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good job, that part with Phase Array Beam Steering was mind blowing"
1954,qs2QcycggWU,"I haven't finished yet, but there's an inconsistency in the animation during the comparison to satellite TVs. In the animation, the earth is rotating opposite the satellite. Geosynchronous satellites are supposed to follow the earth's rotation."
1955,qs2QcycggWU,"There is no earth rotation.
Could you prove the rotating ball earth ?
If yes, bring me a uncut video (no fisheye lens) from 3 to 40 km above ground where we can see the earth rotating at the equator with 15 degrees per hour. 1 TURN around the own axis of the earth means at the equator 40000 km per day or 1666 kmh or 463 Meter per second

If you couldn't show that rotation as quick as a fighter jet / a 9mm machine pistol bullet / 14 times the speed of a class 5 hurricane -  the spinning ball earth does not exist.

And Please 
Show evidence that the rotating ball earth rotates simultaneously around the sun with the hypersonic speed of 108.000 km/h (one hundred and eight thousand km per hour). This is 30 km per second or nearly 65 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

Show simultaneously around the milky way with the hypersonic speed of nearly 800.000 km/h (eight hundred thousand km per hour). 
This is 222 km per second or nearly 481 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

Show evidence that the rotating ball earth rotates together with the sun simultaneously around the milky way with the hypersonic speed of nearly 800.000 km/h (eight hundred thousand km per hour). This is 555 km per second or nearly 1.200 times as quick as a 9 mm machinepistol bullet.

If you do not deliver plausible and scientifically indisputable evidence
Than we have to say that these potential phenomenons did not exist.
And so the earth is flat and did not move."

1960,qs2QcycggWU,This video was deeply informative for a new startup
1961,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, indeed mindblowing😅"
1962,qs2QcycggWU,Sent via Starlink. I had no idea. Thanks for the thorough explanation.
1963,qs2QcycggWU,Cool video
1964,qs2QcycggWU,This is an amazing animated way to explain how a Starlink satellite communication system for Internet works. Really well done in terms of Engineering accuracy to simplifying it to speaking to a 12th grader (its too complicated for a 5th grader anyways)
1965,qs2QcycggWU,I remember watching watching Everyday Astronauts videos on this stuff in 2019 (or was it 2018? I don’t remember) and it was crazy. I didn’t know they had a running service by now. I wonder how the rocket launches are going. All I remember was watching crash after crash in 2020.
1966,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy 😂😂
1967,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing. You covered everything. When I get a side problem while watching the video, in the next second you explain that like I asked from you... ❤"

1979,qs2QcycggWU,Am blown away by this video and really appreciate the time you put into its creation. I have subscribed and this going to use it as a knowledge platform for all my technological adventures. Thanks tremendously for this
1980,qs2QcycggWU,"Great stuff, very well explained!"
1981,qs2QcycggWU,"hello there your support is badly needed to bring this scandal to the international community, 
for so many years now and employees of Saudi Aramco oil company are suffering from a conflict between 
the big guys with high positions in the company, minor employees pay the price for their fight,
employees being monitored 24/7 for reasons that they don't understand and being monitored  using 
the Targeted individual program that is only few in this world who knows about. 
it's a torture tool without evidence and technology that can be denied to exist, 
and when the victim complains about it they immediately call him/her psychopath. 
big entity like this company that is sinking in corruption have many ways to cover their shit with a lot of money. 
Media help is badly needed to investigate this crime. 
no matter how wired this message is what's happening is real and it's happening every single day."
1982,qs2QcycggWU,"Love the video! Thank you for that. The only issue I have is with your statement ""To help become a revolutionary engineer and entrepreneur like Elon Musk you have to be versed in a wide range of fields in science and engineering"". Unfortunately Elon Musk's science and engineering knowledge is quite poor as far as I can tell, being a professional engineer myself. In fact the only reason he is involved with those companies is because he grew up rich, his father having owned blood diamond mines."
1983,qs2QcycggWU,"amazing work. thankyou for your efforts.  Can you do one on the preccession of the Earth, the great year."
1984,qs2QcycggWU,You are an amazing teacher❤
1985,qs2QcycggWU,Wtf
1986,qs2QcycggWU,Is 64 QAM the only modulation used or will they switch to a lower complexity modulation if environmental conditions result in high vector error rate?

2046,qs2QcycggWU,First time viewer - Subscribed
2047,qs2QcycggWU,An incredibly simple explanation of such a complex topic. This video is simply brilliant. Your work is magnificent.
2048,qs2QcycggWU,Very complex
2049,qs2QcycggWU,Guess what i'm watching this video on
2050,qs2QcycggWU,"TV and radio satellites are geostationary,  i.e. they remain in the same position to provide a given footprint on the earth. Your animation showed these as moving, which is incorrect."
2051,qs2QcycggWU,"They stationary relative to Earth, but they still moving."
2052,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!!!
2053,qs2QcycggWU,mind is blown
2054,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely awesome technology. Thumb up guys.
2055,qs2QcycggWU,Hey really enjoyed that no problem understanding keep up the good work. 😊
2056,qs2QcycggWU,"Интересно, спасибо"
2057,qs2QcycggWU,"Phase shifting is used to steer the EM beam to a particular star link. And it is also used to encode binary. How does that work. If the phase is changed to encode a binary, the constructive interference must shift right ?"
2058,qs2QcycggWU,The Russians claim that they have a way to jam this system.  Do you have any idea how they are doing this.?
2059,qs2QcycggWU,Just interfering with the waves by sending false signals that the sats pick up and don’t know what to deal with.
2060,qs2QcycggWU,@@imperialdoggo5826 false signal would not work since the satellite and ground station would have to handshake in order to know where to send a signal to.  Like a beam is being created that is really strong as it is focused between the satellite and ground station. Like everything else is being ignored. Somehow if the code to handshake is compromised I would think it might be possible to mess things up.  Possibly some spying or purposeful sharing could cause some problems.  I would not put it past some of the people at starlink.  Though it appears the Starlink is working throughout the Black Sea and most of Russia now. US military is now the main contract holder now.  I don't think Musk is loosing money on the program now.
2061,qs2QcycggWU,"@@stanleytolle416 it’s all encrypted using ISP grade multi-series dual authentication encryption. Not even the best hackers can crack that. Cisco, the company that connects most places to the internet knows what they are doing."
2062,qs2QcycggWU,"There are plenty of papers you can read regarding jamming and anti-jam techniques for satellite communications. I am a satellite communications engineer and although I don't have time to explain it all, I can say that the techniques for jamming Starlink satellites are not any different from the techniques used to jam normal satellites."
2063,qs2QcycggWU,Why did i just wach this video and i dont even intall starlink
2064,qs2QcycggWU,"Okay this is an awesome channel, bravo. Also, I got about 45 seconds into the video before my mental capacity was way too engulfed by the content to count stars lol"
2065,qs2QcycggWU,"Beautifull video, thanks a lot !"
2066,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is legendary!
2067,qs2QcycggWU,"There are no satellites in ""orbit."" Almost exclusively, our intercontinental internet traffic is through undersea cables."
2068,qs2QcycggWU,This is perfect for visual thinkers.
2069,qs2QcycggWU,Good knowledge😊
2070,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
2071,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
2072,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
2073,qs2QcycggWU,So much respect for making such thorough and easily digestible videos
2074,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks you for very nice explain about the internet connection satellite.❤❤❤
From Philippines."
2075,qs2QcycggWU,Great
2076,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for explaining in such a intresting way : )
2077,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video 😮
2078,qs2QcycggWU,❤
2079,qs2QcycggWU,"Its interesting that balloons are still used to keep some Satelites aloft  😂 also iteresting no ? space ship has ever left earths atmosphere ... nothing passes through the van hallen radiation belt, nothing from earth ever has with technology available... but i forgot you beleive in the fairytale trained into you since birth."
2080,qs2QcycggWU,Great video and channel! Malaysia hadir 😊
2081,qs2QcycggWU,When you do Phase change for bits transmission won't it affect the Direction of the beam in accordance to the satellite
2082,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. How do the Starlink satellites scale to thousands of users when they only have two Dishy facing phased arrays?
2083,qs2QcycggWU,I'm asking the same question. How does it work?
2084,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool
2085,qs2QcycggWU,Decades to build . Months to research . 15m to digest .
2086,qs2QcycggWU,"Control total de la humanidad, la poca que queda, proyecto militar de f.elon  Pus. Sudáfrica 😂 y los imbéciles se lo creen"
2087,qs2QcycggWU,That was awesome! Keep making these videos I’m hooked now😅
2088,qs2QcycggWU,In just 2 of your videos I have a level of understanding about electromagnetic waves and how it drives our most advanced technology than I ever thought was possible.  I just assumed some concepts were beyond my ability to comprehend. Turns out the quality of the teacher is as important to our ability to learn as the amount of effort we put into it. I cant believe I understand this! Thanks for expanding my horizon!
2089,qs2QcycggWU,"The amount of detail, animation, presentation, editing, quality is top notch. Brilliant"
2090,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work
2091,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, super cool video!"
2092,qs2QcycggWU,Gid I hate videos that publish their info in only kilometers.
2093,qs2QcycggWU,Oh I’m sorry that other nations exist and your incapable of converting km to miles. The world doesn’t cater to you.
2094,qs2QcycggWU,Noice
2095,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks 👍
2096,qs2QcycggWU,I thought it be confusing complicated video. But I'm shocked because i understand them all. Thanks for the explanation
2097,qs2QcycggWU,Tv satellites are stationary no?
2098,qs2QcycggWU,This was my favourite movie of the year :0
2099,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine this guy being our high school science teacher.. awesome presentation!!
2100,qs2QcycggWU,I enjoyed the video very much even though a lot of it went over my understanding. I appreciate the common language and visual graphics which me to understand the concepts. Thank you!
2101,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
2102,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. First, when the transmitting and receiving medium is wide open, someone could capture the same electromagnetic waves and construct the data, which basically is stealing the data. But then, I reminded myself of the encryption mechanisms to safeguard data security. However, I can beam unwanted signals to interfere with the actual signals originating/received by the Dishy, so my question is, how are users protected from targeted external interference?"
2103,qs2QcycggWU,"0:00: 🛰 Satellite internet technology explained
3:51: 📡 The Dishy McFlatface antenna is a complex phased array system with 1280 antennas that work together to send and receive electromagnetic waves to and from Starlink satellites.
7:43: ✨ The patch antenna generates oscillating electric and magnetic fields that create an electromagnetic wave.
11:36: 📡 Antenna patches are designed to transmit and receive specific frequencies, while blocking out all other frequencies.
15:20: 📡 The video discusses the use of phased array beam steering to angle a powerful beam towards Starlink satellites.
18:41: 🛰 Phase shifting is used to angle the beam and point it directly at the satellite in Dishy.
22:53: 📡 Dishy and the Starlink satellite use 64QAM modulation to send data, with each symbol lasting 10 nanoseconds.
26:19: 📡 The video explains how Starlink and Dishy send data to each other using electromagnetic waves.
Recap by Tammy AI"
2104,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic!
2105,qs2QcycggWU,"Love this video!!!  You are very easy to understand and you explain stuff that's Hard for us to understand into like chunks that are not hard to swallow. I didn't even know the dishy was half - duplex. Also that the dish doesn't track the sat physically which makes sense. Like you said, you would break the motor within a month or two.   

You should do the GEN 2 dish."
2106,qs2QcycggWU,Beyond incredible visual
2107,qs2QcycggWU,Just showing support. Thank you.
2108,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Interesting! And that guys voice reminds me of Casey Kasem.
2109,qs2QcycggWU,So basically can simply be destroyed without even a weapon. Just play some garbage in front of the satellite humans are so f****** stupid their technology is even more stupid f*** is wrong with you people
2110,qs2QcycggWU,You're not supposed to be here. This was made with technology.
2111,qs2QcycggWU,مساكين يعشقون الڨرافيك
2112,qs2QcycggWU,"how do i believe you when the earth is completely flat ,
and you explain in round ball😅"
2113,qs2QcycggWU,Your brain is flat
2114,qs2QcycggWU,تتنفسون الكذب
2115,qs2QcycggWU,"everything is fake 
there is no starlink"
2116,qs2QcycggWU,Oh so what am I paying $70 a month for?
2117,qs2QcycggWU,"man  
do you realy think earth is a ball , you are crazy
you pay 70 dollar for new connection system , dosn't mean satellite internet 
believe me there is no satellite like he explained ,there is only helium baloon and earth is flat"
2118,qs2QcycggWU,"wow that's amazing how it works and how you showed it thank you, a quick question so every satellite can cover 2 dishy only? because there only 2 antenna on satellite to connect to dishyes?"
2119,qs2QcycggWU,Any signal attenuation from Dishy radome?
2120,qs2QcycggWU,My starlink gives me 126 ms 💀💀😢
2121,qs2QcycggWU,Yep definitely made a believer of me - subbed and liked and now commented this was very well done thank you for this - I don’t like videos lightly because I want my liked video list to be concise and easily referenced later
2122,qs2QcycggWU,"Like a guts ache and a coffee by three looks of that red,.
Deguasing .provides more than temporary low interference.
Cause your factory reset is no longer and option once used"
2123,qs2QcycggWU,We have a moral duty to support this channel. ❤
2124,qs2QcycggWU,wow!
2125,qs2QcycggWU,good
2126,qs2QcycggWU,👍
2127,qs2QcycggWU,great visuals and explanatinons
2128,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. You shold do the Gen 2 dish
2129,qs2QcycggWU,And how does the satellite work who talks simultaneously too many dishes?
2130,qs2QcycggWU,They will auto-balance the load on the sats.
2131,qs2QcycggWU,"Has it been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this technology will not interfere with bird, and insect migrations, or any other natural signal that emulates life as natural biology and evolution of earthly species?"
2132,qs2QcycggWU,No. Any EMF doesn’t become dangerous until about 300 GHz. There is no safety risk.
2133,qs2QcycggWU,What about the night sky star pollution as thousands of these things light up the night sky instead . What will the psychological effect on humans as well other species? @@imperialdoggo5826
2134,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanations and visuals. Love it
2135,qs2QcycggWU,You should do a brief video of what's different about version one versus version 2 starlink
2136,qs2QcycggWU,Tv satelite rotating counter earth rotation 
2137,qs2QcycggWU,Words can't express the scale of knowledge in your videos. I use Starlink daily (heck this comment is being sent to you via Starlink at this moment) and now I understand more how all this is possible. It's incredible how this works and the labor of love you put on these explanations. Thank you.
2138,qs2QcycggWU,❤
2139,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a ad on vulcan tv 🖖
2140,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. I’m a Radio planning engineer and this is by far the best explanation of so many steps of the wireless communication system!!!!!
2141,qs2QcycggWU,Very good overview
2142,qs2QcycggWU,The videos on this channel have really allowed me to appreciate just how complex technology is and just how tiny and precise some of the things that hold up our lives are!
2143,qs2QcycggWU,"Last year as i gazed out across puget sound I viewed what ibptesumedva star yet elongated enough i considered my vision the cause 
My gf however saw it and was unable to figure out what it was because it was too lomg to be a star well about 3 of us stood outside as light was quickly fading after a lovely sunset
As it definayely did not look like a satelite nor a plane yet it moved like blimp speed
The length was significantly bizarre i had nothing
The speculation was that it was a starlink train 
It was like a train or taunt chain of equidistant lights
So my eye is able to detect the light emitted from above 
Does the anttena actially collect human eyes that are unsuitable for implants and harvest mechanisms in the eye in order to produce some adpect of this technology 
I dont mean that its like seeing but the eye ball us just a mechanisms"
2144,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome first viewing of Branch Education.
2145,qs2QcycggWU,"#Mindblown.

Well done! :)"
2146,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative
2147,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for this huge information
2148,qs2QcycggWU,"Man I love this channel, I wish I had found its years ago when it started. Keep making great content, I’ll be honest, this video got me to sign up for brilliant again. Thank you for excellent education material for free."
2149,qs2QcycggWU,Mindddd bougling😮😮😮😮
2150,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm watching this using a Starlink connection. Like, if you as well! 👍"
2151,qs2QcycggWU,Who are from 🇮🇳
2152,qs2QcycggWU,Elon is great!
2153,qs2QcycggWU,I am soo happy that I am electrical n electronics engineer
2154,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing tech! Using Starlink but didn't understand the principles!! Great job!!👍👍👍👍
2155,qs2QcycggWU,Perfect detail and was very nice to have this solid review for me.  Thank you and please keep going!!!   Love your work and appreciate it so very much!  Well done!
2156,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, nice job. You can really tell that you did much work to get this video out!"
2157,qs2QcycggWU,"How does this type of video clip and editing you usually do?
Can you make a video on this topic too?"
2158,qs2QcycggWU,I loved it . Please make more informative videos like that.❤
2159,qs2QcycggWU,Genius!
2160,qs2QcycggWU,"Please, What's GPS?"
2161,qs2QcycggWU,"Every person on the planet should be made to watch these and similar videos y'all made until it is understood. Te technologies that make our world work are greatly underappreciated. 
subscribed !!"
2162,qs2QcycggWU,The best explanation!
2163,qs2QcycggWU,Yep - you got that right - jaw
2164,qs2QcycggWU,this is a really interesting topic and technology. thank you for such nice video
2165,qs2QcycggWU,thanks so much
2166,qs2QcycggWU,"The most mind boggling thing about this is how such a small satellite can deal with so many different requests and unique 'data packages' sent to each consumer. You'd think id' all get jumbled up or that you'd need a 1:1 ratio for it to work. I have the same question about cell phone towers. Secondly is how tf does the signal reach space without getting absorbed by the atmosphere or dissipating, kinda like a 2 meter wave in an ocean 5 km away."
2167,qs2QcycggWU,"28:08 In the whole electromagnetic wave transmission section, you missed out the most fascinating part which I would love to understand - how do those oscillation become data, aka 1s and 0s, on and off. I mean if the whole thing is oscilating constantly it'd just be 010101010101 constantly which is kinda useless. I know how an antenna works, but I don't understand how exactly the correct signal is made."
2168,qs2QcycggWU,"This channel is so damn good in graphics and teardown... but then you get such weird comments as ""watch at 1.25 speed"" like what even? By far the strangest educational channel I've ever seen... It's like so professional in the presentation, but so awkward with the PR/audience messaging lmao"
2169,qs2QcycggWU,I Love your videos. Please keep them coming
2170,qs2QcycggWU,Mind Blown indeeed!!!!
2171,qs2QcycggWU,This is  only channed in the subscribe list
2172,qs2QcycggWU,"I just can't dimension all the work-hours, brilliant minds and development resources that were needed to engineer this technological marvel, includin all the people involved on understanding, applying and discovering all the science behind this throughout the history. It's just incredible!"
2173,qs2QcycggWU,it's the easy explanation I have ever seen. thank you to the team who make this exciting content. also thanks to Mr.Starlink he supports humans in the digital world seen.
2174,qs2QcycggWU,Great video 👍🏼
2175,qs2QcycggWU,❤
2176,qs2QcycggWU,19:13 I know how AESA radar works. So the way you explain it is just genius and completely fall into my expectation.
2177,qs2QcycggWU,"Like it or not , Elon Musk  is the current icon & father of Invention."
2178,qs2QcycggWU,how about the cloudy weather the signal is good?
2179,qs2QcycggWU,"Heavy thunderstorms will interfere, but simple clouds won't."
2180,qs2QcycggWU,that is amazing many thanks
2181,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible video. Thanks for putting in the time and effort to create it!

One more question I have is how does Dishy switch between satellites and not drop the connection?

I assume the satellites communicate with each other to remember the last bit and basically continues from there?

Does the switch between satellites happened very quickly? So there's no drop in packets?"
2182,qs2QcycggWU,You are doing a great job my friend
2183,qs2QcycggWU,"@BranchEducation Please do a feature on how a Starlink satellite is able to interact with a number of Dishy McFlatface of various users at the same time. Thanks for the above video and greatly  appreciate your contents on educating us on the technologies we are surrounded with and hardly realise the complex maths, physics and engineering that these are equipped with."
2184,qs2QcycggWU,I have the same question. Do you have the answer?
2185,qs2QcycggWU,一开始就有两个问题，1，动画中，地球静止轨道卫星没有“静止“😂。2，延迟20ms没有考虑卫星中继以及地面站距离，如果你在太平洋中央的话🐶。
2186,qs2QcycggWU,Good Work
2187,qs2QcycggWU,who invented and designed this unbelievable technology ?
2188,qs2QcycggWU,"quien es el freaking genio detras de esto, cada solucion a cada problemas es exponencialmente mas estupidamente simple y de igual manera mindblowing."
2189,qs2QcycggWU,Would have become scientist if I have watched these videos in my childhood
2190,qs2QcycggWU,"What if it rains, what if it snows or it´s too hot for our starlink device... will it keep working?"
2191,qs2QcycggWU,PCB can overheat working in 40+ C. Rain is irrelevant and snow is melted by heat.
2192,qs2QcycggWU,I AM AMAZED BY THESE TYPE OF EXPLANATIONS. I LOVED IT . PLEASE KEEP MAKING VIDEOS LIKE THIS. IT IS BRILIANT!
2193,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much
2194,qs2QcycggWU,There are 20 shooting stars
2195,qs2QcycggWU,"Really good presentation 
Loved every bit of it"
2196,qs2QcycggWU,This video has inadvertently helped me to understand QPSK modulation
2197,qs2QcycggWU,"That is a very impressive video, thanks for taking so much trouble."
2198,qs2QcycggWU,"Jesus I need more weed to understand this.😂 Okay, this is stuff for the wizards. And I'm not gonna watch It again.😅 One more time, and I'm gonna land in a psychiatric ward.😂"
2199,qs2QcycggWU,So using two Dishis you can create a long range wireless internet connection and fly an autonomous drone without the usage of a satelite system. You just need to modify part of the software. Boom!
2200,qs2QcycggWU,"OH MY GOD!!!  I was outside last night watching the International Space Station fly over Atlanta.  THEN!  I saw this line of about 10-12 lights in a perfectly straight line, an equal distance from one another.  The lights were about a quarter as bright as the ISS.  A quick Google search told me that Elon Musk was to blame.  I ""never"" called it a UFO and thanks to this (most excellent) presentation, it still ain't a UFO...lol.  THANK YOU from Elon all the way down to the Janitors for making this explanation happen.  My next quest is to find out when and where to look for the satellites in the future!!!"
2201,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video
2202,qs2QcycggWU,"Impressive, I am amazed you never used Geostationary satellites??? I am Hook line & sinker about this and still find it amazing tech. :o) :o) :o)"
2203,qs2QcycggWU,Nice work
2204,qs2QcycggWU,Informative article and animation
2205,qs2QcycggWU,TALP-52-HLM
2206,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best video explanation so far I have watched showing exactly how starlink works.
2207,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative. And those animations are top notch. Keep up the good work.
2208,qs2QcycggWU,sheesh
2209,qs2QcycggWU,sheesh
2210,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
2211,qs2QcycggWU,🎉i want it
2212,qs2QcycggWU,Geostationary satellite at 2:52 moving and it's opposite however it should be synchronous to a point on earth ....😅
2213,qs2QcycggWU,Super in-depth content ❤
2214,qs2QcycggWU,Love this explanation ❤
2215,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for all the hard work. My mind continues to get blown away with all the incredible education you guys are providing. Keep it up.
2216,qs2QcycggWU,cool stuff

2220,qs2QcycggWU,love your videos. very detailed
2221,qs2QcycggWU,"Insane video quality, as always"
2222,qs2QcycggWU,amazing explanation. Thats a real quality work . Thanks 
2223,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellites that provide TV signals do not orbit the earth. They are in geo stationary orbit. Hence their altitude, dude. As you said, TV signal satellite antennas are fixed focus, so, if the TV satellite was moving, you'd have no TV signal. And this basic error after many iterations of content review!"
2224,qs2QcycggWU,No words. Incredible  🔥
2225,qs2QcycggWU,The Aliens are aware we are about ready to have the whole earth online and information is going to explode upwards.  We will achieve star to star  flight soon.
2226,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank God, a video that uses metric system.. Kudos!"
2227,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!
2228,qs2QcycggWU,Sucks
2229,qs2QcycggWU,🤯 all I say
2230,qs2QcycggWU,"Интересное и информативное видео, почти без воды"
2231,qs2QcycggWU,"@22 minutes, is how to seed a derecho"
2232,qs2QcycggWU,"@22.5 minutes, how to know if you should buy another lottery scratch ticket"
2233,qs2QcycggWU,"I don't understand why slow electric currents in the feed wire for an individual antenna would not also induce that oscillating current in the antenna plate, just at a commensurately lower frequency?"
2234,qs2QcycggWU,Bs
2235,qs2QcycggWU,"I've always had an inventive or creative nature; but realized that I lack many core competencies... such as Calculus, Topology, Electronics, Mechanics, and many other super useful subject matter.

Very, VERY appreciative of the information you share here, how you put it all together so elegantly.  I was not bored in the least; but overwhelmed.  Yet, very excited to realize how information nests together to solve problems for technology.

I not only want to invent new technology; but live off grid; and so, I am finding this video extremely gratifying with those goals in mind.

I've been thinking about getting a subscription to Brilliant; and after this, I believe I will.

I subscribed to your channel on the strength of this video, alone.

Your dedication to educating the rest of us in entertaining and in a highly ingenious, manner, taking several months to gather all the information and piece it together like this, is astounding.

I would have to say there aren't many channels I've come across that does as a great a job exploring cutting edge technology, as yours does.  Of course, I haven't had a chance to watch any of your other videos; but I'm making the assumption here, that how you'll do the rest of your videos will probably be quite similar to how you did this one; at least with respect to dedication, care, and professionalism.

I'm just blown away how much you had to research and wonder how you got all that information?  I'm not prying.  Just glad that you guys exist.

2243,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink has generated significant interest and excitement in the tech and internet connectivity communities. Its promise of providing high-speed internet access to remote and underserved areas is seen as a potential game-changer, especially for regions with limited access to traditional broadband options. Is it TRUE?"

2254,qs2QcycggWU,I would like to add info about internet base
2255,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of presentation and completeness of information in this video is remarkable.
2256,qs2QcycggWU,I love these deep dives. Keep up the good work!
2257,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant video. wow. imagine using electronic waves to direct a signal instead of old fashioned mechanical method.
On the third rewatch, I counted 25 shooting stars. Do shooting stars come in 2s and 3s?"
2258,qs2QcycggWU,well done
2259,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you so much for this video, so informative. I want more"
2260,qs2QcycggWU,Noce
2261,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, who has the original patent for the phased array transmit and receive technology? Is this a new technology or has the phased array steering/pointing been around a long time?"
2262,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm not sure of the inventor or exactly when, but most military vehicles and warships have it currently, as well as most consumer class jets, as the video mentioned. The tech is still being integrated, but is used in lots of semi modern technology. I hope that gives you a good time frame. Also now you know that pretty much any antenna/radio dish that is flat uses this technology"
2263,qs2QcycggWU,"Great effort, Thank you so much"
2264,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best engineering animations I have ever seen!
2265,qs2QcycggWU,"Similar to 5G massive mimo. To achieve GB data rates, antenna use 64T64RX cross polarization with 128 antenna patch and high modulation also MU-MIMO. The method SSB, CSI-RS or SRS to pin point where user belong to which antenna."
2266,qs2QcycggWU,The regular KU band TV dishes mentioned reach LEO satellites which fly at the same altitude of the Starlink satellites. The 35K Kms away ones mentioned are geostationary and used by large satellite dishes
2267,qs2QcycggWU,"I SAW 19 SHOOTING STARS, POSSIBLY 20, THE ONE FROM THE BOTTOM MIDDLE.???"
2268,qs2QcycggWU,"WHAT IS ""SCALER WAVE"" and why/who used in against Dallas, Texas, in 2010(sic)??????"
2269,qs2QcycggWU,"Nothing more to say, mind blowing science and explanation"
2270,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
2271,qs2QcycggWU,This is most simple understanding about antennas working and would like to know more about how phased array antenna works
2272,qs2QcycggWU,Just Perfect! Way to go!
2273,qs2QcycggWU,Great effort 👍
2274,qs2QcycggWU,who are the ones whose job is to developp those antenas ? are thehy engineers or researchers ? does engineers can go through that mathematical part of physics ? doing such a jib should be incredibly rewarding in terms of experience and enjoyment of the accomplished work !
2275,qs2QcycggWU,"Does the satellite beam a beam specifically at each dishy, or a broad  signal across the area interleaved for each customer ?   Awesome video"
2276,qs2QcycggWU,It must target to the dishes. Otherwhise there is no syncronizing of the waves possible. But how does that technically work?
2277,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown by the complexity of this technology and the depth of this video!!!!!!!
2278,qs2QcycggWU,Cuantos años pueden durar esas antenas?
2279,qs2QcycggWU,Very complicated but I can follow somehow.
2280,qs2QcycggWU,"Please add mathematical explanation and derivations as well. At least provide links to the resources so that interested people can find and study. I appreciate your effort in creating this video.

Edit: got them in the description. Thank you!"

2294,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool. Very interesting process. I'm glad there are smart people in the world who understand all this stuff.
2295,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool. Very interesting process. I'm glad there are smart people in the world who understand all this stuff.
2296,qs2QcycggWU,"Loved this, thank you."
2297,qs2QcycggWU,:]
2298,qs2QcycggWU,wow! amazing explanation! thank you so much.
2299,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
2300,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, thanks"
2301,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the good content!
2302,qs2QcycggWU,"This was an amazing video. To be able to simplify this subject matter,and yet maintain it's essence of reality, is genius!😂 Thank you so much."
2303,qs2QcycggWU,Extremely well done video. Congratulations.👏👏👏
2304,qs2QcycggWU,So the movement of positive and negative energy creates an electromagnetic wave that when the beams overlap at a specific point carries the signal from the satellite dish to the satellite? Reverse the process and you can transmit? Is that the gist of this?
2305,qs2QcycggWU,Eleven
2306,qs2QcycggWU,It’s hard to wrap my head around anything happening 12 billion times per second. I really need to learn more about frequency waves
2307,qs2QcycggWU,This explanation is mindblowing!
2308,qs2QcycggWU,"Great, Im in Vietnam. Thanks video for details."
2309,qs2QcycggWU,Really cool video
2310,qs2QcycggWU,This shows how brilliant Elon Musk and his Starlink team are.
2311,qs2QcycggWU,Short answer?    Keep your cable of DSL provider.
2312,qs2QcycggWU,"Great , all we need , more radiation , junk above our heads, and for sure , a more fck'd up sky."
2313,qs2QcycggWU,"I will just thank you because making this kind of video needs a lot of  sacrifice. You struggle a lot to make sure we get to understand everything even without our support. We just come and watch without thinking about (how do these people make these videos)
THANK YOU A LOT FOR EDUCATING US FOR FREE."
2314,qs2QcycggWU,great video
2315,qs2QcycggWU,"Now one can understand why it’s difficult to make starling satellites work from a moving vehicle, now you need to alter waves to keep track of a moving vehicle for this you need precise GPS to even start and then all those calculating formulas to shift waves and account for variable vehicle speed and change of direction.
My head is about to explode.
🤔👍"
2316,qs2QcycggWU,"Except you don't think even mention that the satellites have to communicate with each. You show it always communicating with the dishes on the ground.

Absolutely amazing video though!"
2317,qs2QcycggWU,How does this work? It can' target every dish.
2318,qs2QcycggWU,"I am watching this video from a field very far from the city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and of course I receive Internet through starlink.  I am very in awe of the logic behind this technology.  Thanks to the owners of this channel for their great effort to create this great video"
2319,qs2QcycggWU,"The latest air-conditioning remote controlls are very high tech,can alter,cool,transport. And alter weather.What govts are not saying is you electricity will be sent this way once magnified.
I have seen a huge wall of it.
A laser satellite wad also demonstrated. Very destructiveness powerfully in defence or God forbid you'll be tracked doing it ."
2320,qs2QcycggWU,its dishy mc dish face!
2321,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow!!!  So clear and easily understood.  As a retired professional developer of educational material, I have to give the developers 5 stars!  Makes me want to go back to college for engineering.  Thanks a million!"
2322,qs2QcycggWU,"so professional, even though I'm an enthusiast and don't understand so much about the technical things I'm glad you made sure to make it clear for everyone, got a new subscriber!"
2323,qs2QcycggWU,What program makes these animations?
2324,qs2QcycggWU,Does anyone here use starlink or is it just for twitters tweeting
2325,qs2QcycggWU,It's phenomenal to get to watch this while using my dishy. Thank you for the explanation! It was both very informing and captivating!
2326,qs2QcycggWU,Great vid guys
2327,qs2QcycggWU,Heads up🎉🎉
2328,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this magnificent video. What is the total transmission capacity of a single starlink satellite?
2329,qs2QcycggWU,"so cool and fun to watch and learn, this already made my day watching it first thing in the morning!!!"
2330,qs2QcycggWU,good
2331,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nice video,"
2332,qs2QcycggWU,Is great that this channel exists!
2333,qs2QcycggWU,Valeu!
2334,qs2QcycggWU,yesss it is really mind blowing technology and your presentation
2335,qs2QcycggWU,It work in trillion dollar tax debt. Lol
2336,qs2QcycggWU,Great Work !!!
2337,qs2QcycggWU,just wooow!
2338,qs2QcycggWU,Question ….. so 4 or 5 or even 10 years down the road will you have to buy a new or updated kit ???
2339,qs2QcycggWU,"I reporting this channel fr







Every damn thing they create piques my curiosity and I can’t sleep without watching that video!!"
2340,qs2QcycggWU,Lol
2341,qs2QcycggWU,This is mindblowing...very mind blowing...gives me goosebump.. Sine cosine tagent graph I learned back in highschool it was basic and easy concept at the time but it is quite significant factor in this radio telecommuication devices...I also fly drones and there is active tracking device that mechanically points the video receiver patch antenna towards a drone so I thought the Dishy also does that too but phased array beam steering?!!!!!!!! whahhaaaaaa this is crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😯😯😯😯😯😮😮😮😮
2342,qs2QcycggWU,"guys im understand, believe me :("
2343,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best video related to technology that I've seen ever.
2344,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink = more advanced ground based towers and undersea cables together with high altitude balloons topped with a huge pile of bull crap….speaking of bull crap note the exaggerated views 😂😂😂😂 waaaaaaake up people… Elon is hysterically laughing at you all.
2345,qs2QcycggWU,Extremely well done. “Brilliant” use of visuals and just enough detail to get the concept.
2346,qs2QcycggWU,The concept is for mentally challenged people.
2347,qs2QcycggWU,"So far, one of the best video on the topic. And I am a microwave engineer working in the space business. Hats off."
2348,qs2QcycggWU,Good video
2349,qs2QcycggWU,Danke!
2350,qs2QcycggWU,"All I can say is, to much that can malfunction. 😮"
2351,qs2QcycggWU,I love it
2352,qs2QcycggWU,great
2353,qs2QcycggWU,Loved it.🔥🔥
2354,qs2QcycggWU,One of the most brilliant explanation i have ever seen
2355,qs2QcycggWU,Star link doesn't pay for telecommunication engineering
2356,qs2QcycggWU,You all deserve an honorary PhD in EE.  There are many professors who will never be able to explain it as clearly as your video.  Disclaimers ob advanced theory were icing on the cake.  Thank you.
2357,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video very well explained! Thank you and congrats! 👍🏻
2358,qs2QcycggWU,"I’m a field scientist/engineer and considered pretty smart. But I’m eating my crayons compared to the minds that develop tech like this. 

Those that design chips, and especially those who develop the tools to build them, I’m convinced are immersed in Spice Gas somewhere living like the Dune Spacing Guild navigators."
2359,qs2QcycggWU,definitely you are doing a great job. Thanks a lot
2360,qs2QcycggWU,Ukrainian Armed Forces said Starlink great one
2361,qs2QcycggWU,"So they didn't find the way of forming of separate 'antennas' by each point of antenna, making such source uninterruptable in complex signal producing view. Very interesting.  Discrete chipsets use weaker strength, overpassed by common coherent enforcement made by interference. While they don't use whole antenna area for good strength, rather width and stability. 


When you warm up the plate, it gives temperature spot for all atoms, reflecting, with assumption to all, in some interval, changes of 'flame.


But these flows are not directed. As temperature flows glue up to almost anything around, producing specific plasma. 😉 

Thus temperature can be directed and isolated. Thus never evaluate temperature of stars as of warm heap you make in pretty not developed nuclear reactors. Having no knowledge in protonuclear reactions having STRUCTURED and controlled vibrations of specific type, with appearing of structured plasma flows, that can be managed changing directions of particles and not only...


Sounds like science fiction. 

- Thus I would like to ask Mask:


While satellite passes Earth orbit, it is 'unhooked' by one gravity forces (with own vectors) leading to approximately center of Earth, and hooked by another one? 😅

Or they are same? Like instant connection that appears or disappears at some point like some glue or well stretching strip? I like interesting questions... 😊


Or where is inertia stored, accumulated? Being some substance etc? Like water in cane? 😉 As it is impossible otherwise."
2362,qs2QcycggWU,Crazy video!
2363,qs2QcycggWU,Insane detail❤
2364,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, I'm truly impressed by the immense effort and dedication that went into creating this video. The level of detail and clarity in explaining how Starlink works is absolutely commendable. It's evident that a tremendous amount of research, planning, and creativity was poured into every aspect. Thank you for taking the time to educate and inspire us. Keep up the fantastic work!"
2365,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! I was always curious how wavelengths transmit data. You explained it really well.
2366,qs2QcycggWU,My brain hurts thinking about this now.
2367,qs2QcycggWU,❤good working ❤
2368,qs2QcycggWU,"smart people in the world who understand all this stuff.

2369,qs2QcycggWU,That’s a lot of brain work
2370,qs2QcycggWU,What about human mind? Is human mind is like that satellite and computer????
2371,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
2372,qs2QcycggWU,"I would love to see a video on how different types of antennas work. Such as helical antennas, patch antennas, and omnidirectional antennas."
2373,qs2QcycggWU,Had no idea it was so simple!
2374,qs2QcycggWU,The production quality that went into this video just earned you another subsciber
2375,qs2QcycggWU,"The videos created by this channel are absolutely astonishing. Each one has a quality and depth that can be matched by only a few others. I love how even the intricate details are discussed, without getting lost in it. The research and work that goes in each video must be immense. My respect to the creators for providing this amazing content for free, teaching the public and creating a new generation of engineers that will advance humanity one step further.

2385,qs2QcycggWU,"The content is very informative and accurate. I even told my engineering buddies about this. Moreover, with the animation used it is better for us to all understand."
2386,qs2QcycggWU,Write a comment below... ✓
2387,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation!
2388,qs2QcycggWU,There is one thing I don't understand. Both data encoding (the 6 bits) and beamforming (interferences) rely on changing the phase of the emitted/received signal right ? How do they not penalize each other ?
2389,qs2QcycggWU,"Beamforming relies on individual phase shift. 
Data transmission relies on phase shift of the entire beam."
2390,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
2391,qs2QcycggWU,The level of minutiae served up here is over the moon crazy. I suppose if you're wanting to get hired on you'd need to pass the test after watching the video. As he says @ 15:12 lets move on. I saw the train flying over last night and it was quite a sight!
2392,qs2QcycggWU,More Please
2393,qs2QcycggWU,Copy from dram video
2394,qs2QcycggWU,"I am an old radar tech.  It is nice to see confirmation for one of my ""rule of thumb"" theories how they did this. Awesome."
2395,qs2QcycggWU,"As an ex telecoms engineer, I knew most of the aerial theory, which you presented in a marvellous way.   The QAM  modulation theory was new to me however, so thanks for that.   I think you missed out the bit that your demo only showed one receive dish and one satellite.  Whereas the one satellite has to maybe serve 1000 ground stations simultaneously, maybe using Time Domain Multiplexing...  I hope your next video will cover this simple aspect."
2396,qs2QcycggWU,coool
2397,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool , after watching this i also wanted to be an engineer"
2398,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video  will definitely be watching more
2399,qs2QcycggWU,Worst internet signal we ever had.  Cannot do live stream.  Cutting during 20 seconds every 5 minutes during sat swap.

2401,qs2QcycggWU,11!
2402,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation of phased shift array. Thank you
2403,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is so refreshingly similar to the GM and Ford videos of the 1950s, explaining extremely advanced concepts about engines to the masses in a clear, understandable way. Fantastic.

Based on the brief credits, are you saying only nine people produced this video over the 6?? months mentioned? Incredible!
As I am a 3 wk old Starlink customer, this was informative to watch. The advancement of technology is just incredible. 
Thanks for putting this out there."
2425,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video! I just have one question how does the satilite manages to send and receive data to thousand of users when it only has two anthenas for that?
2426,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing video. Thanks

2437,qs2QcycggWU,great video!
2438,qs2QcycggWU,This video BLEW MY MIND HOLY CRAP
2439,qs2QcycggWU,Create more vids ❤
2440,qs2QcycggWU,"Hmm, eiropai un vel varbut kadai 3 valstij ja tas butu atlauts"
2441,qs2QcycggWU,"I am assuming that the “dishy” is picking up the next satellite that is closer to its current look angle rather than spanning back across the sky to pick up the next satellite on the same orbit? If not, why would Starlink waste time creating a mesh network of satellites orbiting in specific paths in order to avoid collisions?"
2442,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent technology but still not secure as fibre optic communication.
2443,qs2QcycggWU,Pizzaaa size 😂
2444,qs2QcycggWU,Electrons only move at about 1mm/second in a conductor. It is the electric field that moves. Please try and be more factual in your representations. You must communicate with  exactitude or everything you publish will be suspect.
2445,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing 😮

2447,qs2QcycggWU,"There is no good guess ot what technology will be in 10, 15, 20 years. The rate of progress is almost exponential at this point.  Fortunate to see it"
2448,qs2QcycggWU,"The clarity of thought, speech and animation in your videos is stupendous!! Great intent demonstrated. Great effort put into creating such a visually accurate animation!!"
2449,qs2QcycggWU,this is a bouncer for me ...if i go to the mathematics side
2450,qs2QcycggWU,This has a lot more physics than networking or any IT-related stuff. Totally Mind-blowing

2462,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing mind blowing 🤯 👌🏻
2463,qs2QcycggWU,"Such a well detailed and informative video, thank you!"
2464,qs2QcycggWU,Any details on how many antenna elements are on the square advanced dish?
2465,qs2QcycggWU,How does the reciving end know the phase shift ?
2466,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible work in research and putting together all the bits and pieces and forming it into a flawless narrative. It's amazing to see the trasnformational technologies Space X engineers have bequeathed us and generations to come.
2467,qs2QcycggWU,"they arent 550km above the atmosphere, they are 550km above the surface"
2468,qs2QcycggWU,Great content 
2469,qs2QcycggWU,Is star link going to replace undersea internet cables?
2470,qs2QcycggWU,Simply mind blowing and a fantasticly made video
2471,qs2QcycggWU,"does it differentiate between my data and someone else's by transmitting identify , and how do the satellites know where to send back the data to? Great video btw 😮"
2472,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic work. Keep going 💪
2473,qs2QcycggWU,If the array is phase shifted and the waveform is phase shifted surely this put's things out of balance?
2474,qs2QcycggWU,I understood that completely.
2475,qs2QcycggWU,Greatest video so far I watched.
2476,qs2QcycggWU,That's type of technology is really amazing thanks a lot for these explanations
2477,qs2QcycggWU,I just saw starling last night up in Kelowna. It looked like something from a Sci fi movie.
2478,qs2QcycggWU,How far does the array scan off axis or mechanical boresight?
2479,qs2QcycggWU,This is great. Thank you!
2480,qs2QcycggWU,me like video so I make comment below like commanded
2481,qs2QcycggWU,"Now we know why is so expensive. But this solution is made for who doesn't have access to internet in those areas where there are no cable connections. There are many areas even in well advancede countries, upper the montain or some high hills, or in the middle on nowhere, usefull especialli if we'll be able to give signal to our mobilephones, Apple already started to develop it, but just for emergency calls, it seems the future will be satellites connections also for our mobilephones. It can save lives when are in danger."
2482,qs2QcycggWU,Very good detailed video. Thank you
2483,qs2QcycggWU,top
2484,qs2QcycggWU,amazing vid
2485,qs2QcycggWU,Stunning. This was the only explanation I could find on the technical details of Starlink. Thank you!
2486,qs2QcycggWU,I love this! I'm just getting into Networking and I have such a deeper appeciation for the internets.
2487,qs2QcycggWU,Hope Starlink will arrive to Mongolia 💖💖💖
2488,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is a YouTube treasure. I hope it never goes away. By far the best educational channel I’ve ever come across.
2489,qs2QcycggWU,After 8 months YouTube decided to how me this masterpiece🥳
2490,qs2QcycggWU,Can starlink consider having data centers at high altitudes( 4500 ft to 7000 ft) in northeren climate ; thus starlink would achieve an overall reduction NW latency by about 0.44 ms to .64 ms with reduced opex?!
2491,qs2QcycggWU,"this is the most descriptive, narration wise, and mind blowingly on point illustration, all years of studying signals and wireless transmission feels like studying magic and cult knowledge. but with  this video i feel like finally understanding whats happening behind the antenna scene. So cool, really the best illustration ever. really grateful i finnaly understands the magic lessons i've been afraid of all this years in college"
2492,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm blown by the animation and knowledge of physics and Math. I have grown up yarning to study Electrical and electronics engineering,  infact I did excellently in those subjects when graduating from highschool but my parents sent me to study Nursing. If I can only get support from someone, I'm dying to sit in that engineering school"
2493,qs2QcycggWU,When the rain sesion ar could that time what will hepen
2494,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you 🙏
2495,qs2QcycggWU,What is the difference between Starlink and GPS?
2496,qs2QcycggWU,I read an article recently saying that starlink might not last much longer of telcos get their way for 5g as they are looking at using the 12Ghz if they do how about Elon says ok I will make a telco with 5G operating in the 12Ghz band and give a better service than any telco could offer since it wouldn't have much issue anywhere on earth and could be a global roaming with no extra fees 😉
2497,qs2QcycggWU,Greatvifro guys! So much work
2498,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
2499,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind-blowing and very humbling.
2500,qs2QcycggWU,"This technology existed since 1905, called beamforming.
It's just that nobody was idiotic enough to put 4,000 satellites in orbit now and plan to add 40,000 more in the near future.
The business model for such is yet to be proven as the typical lifetime of an LEO satellite is 7–10 years."
2501,qs2QcycggWU,do a video about airtags!! the precision finding is amazing tech.
2502,qs2QcycggWU,Right hand rule where the emission perpendicular to the path the finger or current travels.   I think the electromagnetism wave is traveling the circumference of the single antenna.  That is why the transceiver is octangle or hextangle versus a flat disk.There is installation and a small path or tunnel between each transceiver.
2503,qs2QcycggWU,awesome video
2504,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for sharing
2505,qs2QcycggWU,This is excellent work!
2506,qs2QcycggWU,"Frauds and liars....I've mentioned this many times,;  I'm a USAF veteran with over 1000 hrs of training in electronics and communications with 4 years as an Avionic Communications Specialist...I worked on the largest cargo and passenger aircraft in the world. Both as an enlisted man and civilian at SFO and OAK Airports on 747,767,A300 airbus, DC 9, DC 10 etc...

I was responsible for ALL communications systems including installing, modifying, troubleshooting and removal of UHF,VHF, FM, HF and CDPIR- Crash data position Indicator and recorders ( the black box) NOT ONE SINGLE SYSTEM INTERFACES WITH ANY SATELLITE; EVER....There is NO COMMUNICATIONS LINK between a satellite or aircraft...The power required to send a signal THROUGH THE 50 MILE THICK earth atmosphere, then BACK through 50 mile thick atmosphere would be staggering...

Satellite TV; ISN'T. All ground antenna point to a larger array. GPS is a ground based system and THAT'S why you see more and more repeater towers going up ALL OVER THE  WORLD!"
2507,qs2QcycggWU,Wouldn't the signal be stronger if you point the antenna at the ground rather then the sky?
2508,qs2QcycggWU,@@lolxnn What do you think?
2509,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing 😢
2510,qs2QcycggWU,"Question is, can I game on Star link? I get like 20mb right now. Horrible for playing online. 😢"
2511,qs2QcycggWU,super depth
2512,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, very educative"
2513,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome explanation 
2514,qs2QcycggWU,To World is going with speed but i have daunt that these all tech can destroy the healthy environment and nature
2515,qs2QcycggWU,This kind of video is the main reason why I love science and technology!
2516,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. This deserves to be in the grammys :)
2517,qs2QcycggWU,awesomely incredible.
2518,qs2QcycggWU,This is among the clearest and most understandable explanation I’ve ever heard!  Hats off to the team that produced this content😊
2519,qs2QcycggWU,Scale is the answer
2520,qs2QcycggWU,George Santos invented this process.
2521,qs2QcycggWU,This was amazing!
2522,qs2QcycggWU,how can anyone come up with this? blows my mind. how!!!
2523,qs2QcycggWU,MY BRAIN OVERLOADED
2524,qs2QcycggWU,WELL DONE SIR
2525,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is already outdated garbage. The satellites are cheap very poorly shielded junk and dozens die with every solar flare. They are creating a ridiculous amount of space garbage and ruining views of ground based telescopes. They are nothing but a semi-fraudulent cash grab by a crooked leader of a personality cult.
2526,qs2QcycggWU,Nice 👍
2527,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy's gain should be 1280X that of a single element, unless there's some form of focusing horn on each (of approximately 2 dB).  This video was well done!"
2528,qs2QcycggWU,My biggest question is how does the satellite handle multiple dishy customers? How many dishes can each satellite handle?
2529,qs2QcycggWU,They are not after small fry m8
2530,qs2QcycggWU,25:57 well that's a shame.
2531,qs2QcycggWU,"Simple explanation, just  a basic understanding of waves, EM and terminologies are required. kudos to the research."
2532,qs2QcycggWU,"I really recommend this video to electrical engineering students, especially the ones learning antenna now. Back then in school we were just taught the maths behind it, and no clear explanation of the application like this, which was very boring, doing those complex and vector analysis without visualization.  THANS FOR THIS VIDEO"
2533,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, really great animations!"
2534,qs2QcycggWU,"Teddy these videos are fucking nuts I read on your website and Vision and am beyond impressed you've set out on this journey and have succeeded in creating such BEAUTIFULLY rendered, narrated, and explained videos."
2535,qs2QcycggWU,Elon musk wants to tweet from interstellar space and it reach earth instantly 😂
2536,qs2QcycggWU,This is mind boggling and simply amazing
2537,qs2QcycggWU,You all did such a premium job on this video!!❤❤❤
2538,qs2QcycggWU,What a marvellous video !
2539,qs2QcycggWU,"Liked, subbed, and commented👍🏾"
2540,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm not sure if it was mentioned in the canadian subtitles, but the constellation would be arranged such that adjacent bitcodes are easily distinguished from each other in order to reduce the effect of error. In general, the probability of error is inversely related to the smallest distance between points on the constellation, so one option is to make adjacent signals on the constellation obviously different from each other so that error-detecting and correction algorithms on the receive-side can work to mitigate error signals more effectively than if the bitcodes were arranged in sequential order."
2541,qs2QcycggWU,"very very impressive
as a ECE student it helps me a lot
thank you for your hard work"
2542,qs2QcycggWU,I deserve your team work...extremally excellent work..  keep it up..
2543,qs2QcycggWU,😀
2544,qs2QcycggWU,YOU ARE SELLING LOT OF SHIT TO THIS PEOPLES WHO DIDNT HAVE A BRAIN!!!!
2545,qs2QcycggWU,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2546,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown. Thank you!
2547,qs2QcycggWU,Only SpaceX would name their satellite dish DISHY MCFLATFACE. Their humor is out of this world.
2548,qs2QcycggWU,nice
2549,qs2QcycggWU,"So good to now how this amazing system works, I work in the remote Pilbara in Western Australia , we are now in our region exploration time, I was given a Starlink to install at our camp, so amazing how small and simple to setup. Much better communications just using our cell phones rather than sat phones."
2550,qs2QcycggWU,good
2551,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing and excellent.increible y muy interesante
2552,qs2QcycggWU,Sho I loved it
2553,qs2QcycggWU,What *he* said
2554,qs2QcycggWU,"you all are so naive. THERE ARE NO SATELITES, wakey wakey sheeple. The so-called satellite communication or broadcast is done on a type of frequency band. Military use a different frequency band , Police use a different frequency band, HAM radios use a different frequency band, cell phones use a different frequency band. Starlink uses a different frequency band. That transmit the radio waves VIA COMMUNICATION TOWERS on EARTH not from so-called satellites????? I will give anyone $10,000 to provide proof of a satellite in so-called space, photographed from earth's surface NOT a CGI image. I will give anyone $20,000 that can provide proof of ANTI_GRAVITY technology that works outside that the Military industrial complex uses on their man-made space craft. Explain this to your self - How does a satellite stay in orbit flying around the earth 24/7/365?????? How much fuel does a satellite need to stay in orbit????? What type of fuel does a satellite use????? What kind of propulsion system does a satellite use to navigate space??? If you can see space craft fly over the surface of the moon with a telescope, why can't you see a so-called satellite flying a quarter of the distance away.????  If there are 1000's of so-called satellites flying around in orbit, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THEY???? Stop being brain dead idiot's people. NASA LIES MATTER lol."
2555,qs2QcycggWU,"The fact that you don't understand does not mean that is not true. I have a simple question, if the signals are broadcasted from the ground then why is the signal present only if i point the antenna at the sky?"
2556,qs2QcycggWU,This technology is nothing compared to the beam forming technology by AST Spacemobile to stream to an ordinary unmodified cell phone. No dish required. Launching next year!
2557,qs2QcycggWU,"that's amazing, thank you!"
2558,qs2QcycggWU,This tecnology is from this earth?
2559,qs2QcycggWU,The amount of information your videos give is truly remarkable! The next 5 years will be the most fascinating time ever in history. The advancement in technology and the advancement in AI will be extremely scary as to the potential harm or good that it can have for all mankind. Cyber security is going to play a massive role within the next 5 years! Read a book called Snow Crash. Comprehend and see where we are in the timeline.
2560,qs2QcycggWU,trully a mind blowing tech
2561,qs2QcycggWU,"550 Km outside earth's atmosphere?????  Earth's atmosphere stretches from the surface of the planet up to as far as 10,000 kilometers!!!!"
2562,qs2QcycggWU,"Watched this on 2x speed, now I feel like Flash and everyone is talking slowly."
2563,qs2QcycggWU,Great
2564,qs2QcycggWU,As a communication engineer mostly engaged with equations and physics during my research studies should confess condensing the whole thing in an animation intuitively is another technology to my eyes. Great Job.
2565,qs2QcycggWU,The work behind this video is creeping me out.
2566,qs2QcycggWU,"Hello, as Starlink user i must say, your work is absolute same high quality like Starlink! RESPECT! I don`t understand but can imagine ...... thanX"
2567,qs2QcycggWU,"I just found the gem 💎 channel on YouTube 

I think you can setup your own starlink (Apparts from fund discussion)"
2568,qs2QcycggWU,Wow and wow 👏.  you have a new sub today.
2569,qs2QcycggWU,"The animation of tv satellites is misleading. Unlike low-orbit Star link sats, the tv sats are in geo-stationary orbit. That means they appear to not move, relative to anybody's home satellite dish. In the animation the tv sats circle the Earth in a clockwise direction while the Earth spins counterclockwise, viewed fm North Star. In truth the rotation is the same, exactly."
2570,qs2QcycggWU,In class 12 we learnt all about ci and di and phase... But but but using phase to change direction of interference was just mind blowing
2571,qs2QcycggWU,"I am a radio engineer. I just want to say....Waw, explaining beam forming using massive antenna array ! That is very hard thing to do but you had the simplest and clearest explanation that I have ever seen!"
2572,qs2QcycggWU,"Truly wish we could get a Starlink technology day, to explain what is possible and what they accomplished, and also to educate people that think Starlink is similarly dangerous as 5G can be..."
2573,qs2QcycggWU,"As a radio engineer, do you think all our future advancements are dangerous at all?  5G for example, and even all the starlinks that Elon is transmitting?"
2574,qs2QcycggWU,as a radio engineer you should be smart enough to smell the BULLSHIT ...
2575,qs2QcycggWU,"A little note on comparing the orbits of the TV broadcast satellites and Starlink, from 2:10 onwards: ""Communications satellites used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit (geosynchronous orbit with prograde motion 35,900 km above the equator), so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite.""
In your (magnificent) video the TV satellite is not geostationary."
2576,qs2QcycggWU,"@@usertogo Bonjour à tous de Marc , Passionné de techologies , abonné starlink , qui fonctionne au top , en regard du "" passif""  ... étant éloigné du central sur les hauteurs de Nice ! , radio amateur , par ailleurs dernièrement opérationnel sur l'un de nos satellite QO 100 ! , je voudrai .. si possible pouvoir suivre l'une de vos conf , par exemple sur zoom ou autres ..

2577,qs2QcycggWU,You just completely fucked my brain at 1am
2578,qs2QcycggWU,I'm glad I saw your video it reminded me that I need to get a refund from starlink
2579,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Thank you!
2580,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
2581,qs2QcycggWU,So the device is essentially a mixer and an antenna in the same component? And it’s like a gazillion of them  formed on a PC board. 🤔 You weren’t kidding. This thing is BRILLIANT!
2582,qs2QcycggWU,Such an awesome channel
2583,qs2QcycggWU,Is the Ukrainian army still using Starlink to target civilians   in the Donbas ?
2584,qs2QcycggWU,Yes...Never have and never will use any Musk business products.
2585,qs2QcycggWU,wait so we use energy to make electro waves.. what about transforming electro waves back to power?
2586,qs2QcycggWU,This is truly mind blowing!

2640,qs2QcycggWU,I’m a starlink owner for almost a year. Such a bullshit. The app itself is useless. Same as the internet speed.
2641,qs2QcycggWU,More thank that. The antenna itself isn’t as a dish. Is has a square shaped antenna.
2642,qs2QcycggWU,I use starlink everyday and I don't have any problem with the speeds
2643,qs2QcycggWU,Only liking and subscribing this channel for their mind blowing research and mind blowing technology made by us ( humans)😮
2644,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work? -Spoiler, it don't"
2645,qs2QcycggWU,Works great for me
2646,qs2QcycggWU,"As a Starlink user I think that this type of Internet service is the most ground breaking satellite Internet technology to ever be created! Also my life heavily relies on technology for the most simple things because of my physical disability, so having this Internet service makes life 1 million times easier to control all of my smart home devices. Huge props to Elon and his crew at SpaceX for creating such advanced Internet technology, not only does this help Connect people to the Internet in rural areas but it also gives us access to Internet speeds that are far greater then other rural Internet companies. 

In my mind I really think starlink is also the way of the future when it comes to Internet technology when travelling by airplane or when travelling on cruise ships. I am actually really excited to see some Cruise ships companies actually sign up and have this service installed on their ships, that way they have the ability to keep up with Internet traffic while in the middle of the sea."
2647,qs2QcycggWU,I want to see that formula at the end explain.
2648,qs2QcycggWU,great vid! thank you
2649,qs2QcycggWU,"I've been using Starlink at home for almost 2.5 years. I never really understood how it worked until I saw this video. This is absolutely mind-blowing, and legitimately brought me to tears, out of sheer amazement."
2650,qs2QcycggWU,my brain hurts.
2651,qs2QcycggWU,"i live out in the county and before starlink my net speed was 0.82, now with starlink its 205mbps"
2652,qs2QcycggWU,"This video deserves millions of views because of the sheer amount of work put into it. 

I don't understand all the concepts but I feel better enlightened about something that'll soon become an everyday use item. 

Thank you Branch education! You guys are the bomb!

2656,qs2QcycggWU,"Does this work in high wind areas where the dish might get buffeted about in the wind? Does it use a lot of power to constantly rotate the dish, ie does it work in off grid situations?"
2657,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, it works in extreme winds. I get wind gusts up to 80 mph, and it works just fine. The satellite dish uses about 150 to 200 watts of power. A modestly sized solar array could easily power this, with battery backup for night time."

2665,qs2QcycggWU,So appreciate of videos like this. Thank you!!
2666,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, the animations were top notch and explanation simple enough for most viewers. I'm guessing there is a session handover mechanism between satellites as they enter a coverage zone. Most of the RF concepts are similar to the 4G LTE/5G world, except the user element is stationary while the base station (satellite) is mobile. Plus the distances are much longer than a normal telecom basestation."
2667,qs2QcycggWU,"I am happy that someone is there to explain these things! You have got a me as a subscriber, happy to learn more!"
2668,qs2QcycggWU,"Every time I get down, I come to this channel and with in moments I remember what a time time of light and innovation we live ❤💡😊"
2669,qs2QcycggWU,"makes me appreciate DataCom, peaked my fascination and interest, thank you for this video!"
2670,qs2QcycggWU,what a amazing video! Thanks a lot!
2671,qs2QcycggWU,"To have a stronger internet you'd need many or one huge satellite on the ground on earth thus increasing the distance n radiance to catch higher powered space beams from a distance
Really big ones on coordinate ends on N,E,W,S
Doing the same things yet different things at once sending n receiving information.
Also would have to build a floating one for connecting in mid a between space ocean n earth ocean.

The one in mid air should be able to float n spin to amplify ray speed .
Earth satellites are grounded, n send n receive, 
Mid air on absorb empower, amplify n convert.
N an outer space in outer space one but have to be careful ... which planet of energy of abort you come near have to run test to see have new waves would effect the physical relation of everything"
2672,qs2QcycggWU,awesome work
2673,qs2QcycggWU,Black magic. Change my mind.
2674,qs2QcycggWU,Do we need to pay monthly subscription to starlink after buying and installing the unit?
2675,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, it costs $120 per month."
2676,qs2QcycggWU,​@@TrevorSullivan depending on the location
2677,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing explanation
2678,qs2QcycggWU,"New apocalypse unlocked: those satalights gotta come back down, one day."
2679,qs2QcycggWU,They burn up before they even come close to the ground
2680,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting!
2681,qs2QcycggWU,You have my respect for recommending to watch this at 1.25 speed
2682,qs2QcycggWU,this is really an mazing and informative video
2683,qs2QcycggWU,I feel like I'm getting gaslit
2684,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you <3
2685,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating
2686,qs2QcycggWU,superb!
2687,qs2QcycggWU,We need this in South Africa
2688,qs2QcycggWU,Too much interasting. <3
2689,qs2QcycggWU,Pity we well never enjoy this in Communist South Africa 🤬🤬🤬🤬
2690,qs2QcycggWU,"Sure there is this channel explaining how it it works but I am more in shock at whoever had the brains to think of making such tech, it’s beyond mind blowing"
2691,qs2QcycggWU,you are awesome
2692,qs2QcycggWU,Damn
2693,qs2QcycggWU,Looks like a very expensive and ambitious project. To have that many satellites in orbit webbed around the earth is far from a walk in park...
2694,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy Mcflatface.
2695,qs2QcycggWU,Yes
2696,qs2QcycggWU,Bro this video was INSANE I never knew that such a small pizza like dish was so much complitcated in reality. You just earnt a new sub
2697,qs2QcycggWU,"@2:18 it says Broadcast satellite cannot send data. This is not true. It can for years. Digital TV is just sending data packets bearing video, audio or IP."
2698,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing and very interesting video. I had never seen such video' in which very complex and state of art Technology explaned in awesome way.  Efforts and struggles for this video is extremely, highly appreciated."
2699,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent
2700,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video.
 I really enjoyed  watching this video.
thank you so much"
2701,qs2QcycggWU,so here we are sending data from dishy to satalite but satalite gets changed in every 5-10nsec and lost my connection too with data satalite how the second setalite know my information where i was and what to send as a response
2702,qs2QcycggWU,My background is in history. I don't know much about Mathematics or Physics.  So I cannot fully understand it.
2703,qs2QcycggWU,"Very cool, overly complicated, I cannot fully understand it. I like it however."
2704,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome job
2705,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this in HD using starlink :)
2706,qs2QcycggWU,"wonderful rendition, very very erudite. i would love to be part of this next level of keep the whole world connected ."
2707,qs2QcycggWU,and its  owned by a guy whos  completely unaccountable to those that use this service in terms of the risks he takes with it effecting their service. this is why it should be owned by those that operate the service and use it with a board that is elected by these two parties.
2708,qs2QcycggWU,What are you talkin about
2709,qs2QcycggWU,"If these dishy can focus powerful microwave waves , and we use a microwave oven case around the dishy can it cook food ?🤔"
2710,qs2QcycggWU,It isn't powerful. When it will reach ground it will be way less then radiation from sun.
2711,qs2QcycggWU,"kind of education like this, i would have become an another Elon.. kudos to the creators.."
2712,qs2QcycggWU,Phased array on the roof! What a future
2713,qs2QcycggWU,This is the first satellite system ever compete with high speed broadband and fiber. It’s low latency is mind blowing for what it is.
2714,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't compete with fiber optic
2715,qs2QcycggWU,"So glad I stumbled across this. I had no idea the degree of complexity Starlink employed. This is some of the best instructive animation I’ve come across, excellent work. Thanks!"
2716,qs2QcycggWU,"What is dishy sending to satellite?
Can dishy send a img as a data to satellite and what will satellite do with the img?"
2717,qs2QcycggWU,Satellite just received the ones and zeros and then transmits them to a ground station which then sends the information requested back to the satellite and back to you at home
2718,qs2QcycggWU,"This might be too much to ask, but remembering back to physics 3 in college.  Wouldnt the magnetic field be rotating about the axis of the current but in the opposote direction.  Satisfying the right hand rule of thumb. Lets say we were looking straight into the flow of current where the current was flowing in the direction of our eyes, wouldnt the magnetic field be rotating counter clockwise?"
2719,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much sir for your packaged information & LOVE YOU SIR.
2720,qs2QcycggWU,"The most simplified explanation I have ever seen. Mind blew.
I am curious to know how satellites have all info?"
2721,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this incredible video. It's crazy how we get used to technology. I never thought about how ""Dishy"" would work. But here I am, watching this video, which are H.264 encoded frames, that were sent from a satellite."
2722,qs2QcycggWU,Really H.264? For me the video is in AV1. Google pushes hard against obsolete proprietary codecs. It is using them only for backward compatibility with old devices.
2723,qs2QcycggWU,"the algorithm used in singal adjustment process algorithm is open source , if yes could anyone provide the link ."
2724,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool!
2725,qs2QcycggWU,"While the tech explanation is good and all. Any insights on the risk of collision, decommissioning, space debris and max satellites at 550km low orbit? Starlink's plan to lauch 40000+ satellites seemed like a space grab that squeeze out any potential competitor and seems like a tool for the all seeing eye."
2726,qs2QcycggWU,"The satellites have ion thrusters on them to avoid collisions, and for decommissioning they'll just burn up in Earth's atmosphere."
2727,qs2QcycggWU,good
2728,qs2QcycggWU,I'm feeling lucky to live in this era
2729,qs2QcycggWU,"The way they figured out how to form beams and do all of this blows my mind.  It is also wild to be that we are constantly fighting each other as a species, but there are some amongst us that are so focused and intelligent that they’re pushing us forward into the future."
2730,qs2QcycggWU,"You think starlink isn't a weapon? 🤣😂🤣
Dude, get real.  Don't even consider the cost of engineering this system, just go with the physical properties.
These are supposed to be used to bring internet to ""under developed"" (without internet) areas, right?  Well ""under developed "" areas tend to not have a bunch of extra $ on their hands. 
But before they could turn the first penny of profit they had to launch hundreds of these satellites into orbit.  Then ship out a receiver dish to each individual customer.
How much do you think all those satellites and receivers cost?  And that's all before getting the first customer.
And you think that's another business venture buly spaceman Elon? It never occurred to you that this whole idea could never even recoup the startup costs, let alone turn a profit?
You're watching this video, so obviously you have some interest in the starlink system. But that obvious flaw never crossed your radar?
So naive and trusting"
2731,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you. I got answers I was wondering in my life. I keep searching for ""Satellite"" these days. What is new tech coming in 2023?"
2732,qs2QcycggWU,Naturally watching this on Starlink Roam :)
2733,qs2QcycggWU,StarLink =  SkyNet.          And then just add the AI Elon is building.             Once it goes live itll wipe out everyone just like in the movie terminator
2734,qs2QcycggWU,or wall-e
2735,qs2QcycggWU,"so well explained, thanks!"
2736,qs2QcycggWU,Microwave is 2.45 gigahertz…. And this emits 12? Does that mean we can’t be anywhere near it while it operates?
2737,qs2QcycggWU,Well you wouldn't want to be near the satellite but that's a couple miles in the air.  It's perfectly safe to stand around the dish.
2738,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for this work
2739,qs2QcycggWU,"I definitely didn't expect the Starlink be so complicated, and visuals are great! Thanks you!"
2740,qs2QcycggWU,It doesnt work - they installed all the towers during lockdown to fake it working.
2741,qs2QcycggWU,It does work.
2742,qs2QcycggWU,amazing🤯
2743,qs2QcycggWU,fantastic as usual
2744,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!!!
2745,qs2QcycggWU,"The insane scale of complexity blows my mind, and the animation alone really is easy to follow, even with these number of details shoved into my brain."
2746,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Awesome
2747,qs2QcycggWU,this concept is very old...... i wish they will get into FFT in this process also...... BF is also used in cell towers
2748,qs2QcycggWU,I don’t know where i would even begin to start researching a topic like this in detail. I am extremely impressed and hope to achieve a creation of a similar video to this one day.
2749,qs2QcycggWU,A comment is needed
2750,qs2QcycggWU,THANKS FOR THIS 😊😊
2751,qs2QcycggWU,i have learnt more in this video than my college lecture.
2752,qs2QcycggWU,Some neighbor near me is having slowest starlink internet! May because of a signal booster???
2753,qs2QcycggWU,Nice visual explained. Best way of learning.
2754,qs2QcycggWU,So basically it works like the new radar in the nose of the f35.  Wont take long to dissect this one.
2755,qs2QcycggWU,"hahha there is no satellites exists
it is all at the bottom of the sea under water fibre optic cables transmitting onto a cell tower transmitter
earth spinning there is no way satellites can spin on its own"
2756,qs2QcycggWU,Grow up kiddo. Trolling is lame.
2757,qs2QcycggWU,Can this be used in the surrounding countries/islands surrounding the us?
2758,qs2QcycggWU,Yes it's available in any country that approves it
2759,qs2QcycggWU,E
2760,qs2QcycggWU,Great job. Very fascinating. Very detailed and technical but not too complicated to where you couldn't understand. It had just the right amount of information.
2761,qs2QcycggWU,Does the dish have to adjust frequency for Doppler shift since the satellite is moving at a high speed? Doesn't the frequency increase as the satellite approaches and the frequency decrease as the satellite moves away? Sort of like how the sound of a vehicle passing by on the road changes pitch?
2762,qs2QcycggWU,This video blew my mind. Thanks so much!!
2763,qs2QcycggWU,"Electromagnetic waves in vacuum can travel at the speed of light. I had nooo idea. 😳

2853,qs2QcycggWU,"Two way, Satellite tracking technology is not anything that new, but the refinement in Starlink avoiding moving parts certainly makes it interesting.   The way it switches between different satellites and being able to act like the same connection is quite interesting. 
Your video is really good, it goes into great details and explains it all well.   I would argue that it is complex, rather than complicated.   The principles are not complicated, but the antenna systems is complex :)     Thanks for the video."

2895,qs2QcycggWU,I’m wondering what will happen with thousands and thousands more signals constantly showering us.
2896,qs2QcycggWU,"Video explained how it forms a beam to send signal, but there is no explanation how it amplifies received signal from specific point in sky, to receive signal dish should stop sending any signal itself and so it can't form any bear, normal TV disk amplifies received signal cause of it's form, but how Starlink dish works for receiving signal?"
2897,qs2QcycggWU,This is too detailed that you started wondering how it's free to watch. The author have a god level understanding of technology.
2898,qs2QcycggWU,for a dummy like me who has no concept of how things work will click like and subscribe because these are the only things i can contribute...:)
2899,qs2QcycggWU,Just wondering if they can improve the images on ultrasound transducers when imaging internal organs like the heart since they are using almost the same transmit-receive-beamformer technology?
2900,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!!! Great job! Thanks!
2901,qs2QcycggWU,Great!
2902,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for this video!
2903,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing. Extremely well explained. Never understood how antennas worked in the first place. But this. This made me understand it.
2904,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation i have seen ever..thank you..Keep it up
2905,qs2QcycggWU,Wish this channel actually had a school 😂it's so much easier than what they teach cos of the animations I'm impressed 👍
2906,qs2QcycggWU,How would this version of dishy work on a moving vehicle or boat?  Would the GPS in the dish constantly update as it moves so that all is good?
2907,qs2QcycggWU,"I'd love to watch this, but 28 minutes.  Unnecessary."
2908,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm 51 years old, so my bachelor's in applied mathematics/physics was a long time ago.  Turns out, I had other interests after university.  So, I never properly used my degree and as my dad used to say, ""use it or lose it"".  But I suppose that's not quite true since this video brought much of it flooding back (E&M, for example).  If only we had videos such as this back then!  It would have saved many sleepless nights!  ✌😎"
2909,qs2QcycggWU,I am absolutely amazed after watching this video and thanks for creating this video for us to understand this super-complex tech in such an entertaining and easy way. I know the amount  of hard work it takes to make these videos amd amimations! ❤‍🔥💯🙌🏻
2910,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing technology and video, thanks for creating this."
2911,qs2QcycggWU,Just brilliant. Thank you.
2912,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive visualizations!!!
2913,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
2914,qs2QcycggWU,black magic
2915,qs2QcycggWU,I'm being reminded again that I'm a nerd lol even though I'm not smart.
2916,qs2QcycggWU,"Would be nice to know how signal continuity is maintained between satellites. That is, when one satellite goes out of reach of any particular dish, how does the next satellite take up where the last one left off and a signal stays consistent and constant."
2917,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for making an effort in making this video. Very valuable for new generation of scientists.
2918,qs2QcycggWU,It's one thing to know something but a far deeper understanding of it is needed to explain it to others. Thanks for this beautifully composed information packed video!
2919,qs2QcycggWU,WOW! 🤩
2920,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video!!!
2921,qs2QcycggWU,"far better than expectation, it was very ccrystal clear explaination, thank u soo much"
2922,qs2QcycggWU,you are amazing
2923,qs2QcycggWU,I am from Tanzania...I love this channel
2924,qs2QcycggWU,賴志偉 ffrghij
2925,qs2QcycggWU,PONE 賴志偉 vfhg
2926,qs2QcycggWU,Video very much help
2927,qs2QcycggWU,Thank goodness for White people or else we’d all still be chipping obsidian for sharp edges and living like savages in the European forests and African savanna.  Japan and China would still be a bunch of poor farmers using the power of beasts to till their soil.  The World owes White people a gratitude!   Thank you!  🤍🫶🏻
2928,qs2QcycggWU,costs more - less function-- worse elon gives increased cost and shit performance to the american  poor and reduced cost- even free- to others around the globe with the best service- to rope them in... only to screw them like he doing to americans
2929,qs2QcycggWU,"good job, how about the maintenance?"
2930,qs2QcycggWU,"There's an amazing amount of engineering and science behind the Starlink Satellite system. These animations and explanations helped me to understand the complexity it, better than if someone were to simply tell it to me. Thanks for making videos like this. I hope that there will be more like this that give great explanations to how other types of technology and even explain engineering behind steam powered trains."
2931,qs2QcycggWU,Significant
2932,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi sir .
I am from Nepal.
Does starlink satellite internet work without electricity supply on antenna?"
2933,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing sir
2934,qs2QcycggWU,"22:18 Yes, please do make more videos like this one"
2935,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very very much for all the time en energy spent on this wonderful and educative video 🙏 I really appreciate the hard work ❤️
2936,qs2QcycggWU,What a wonderful explanation
2937,qs2QcycggWU,"You said dishy can handle about 540mbits/second, but what about the satellite that has to share resources with hundereds or thousands of dishys but only has 2 arrays talking to them all. How much bandwidth are those arrays capable of, and how do they have time to beam at each one?"
2938,qs2QcycggWU,"Crappy, really crappy lol, Also your lord and savior musk is raising your prices and taking your mobility away. LOL musk,  useless vapoware salesman with no common sense. Your better off using your phone quite frankly. I use cellular and get 500Mbs down and 100Mbs up. LOLlink, gets what maybe 25 down thats the best I have seen on over 30 different people using it."
2939,qs2QcycggWU,This is cool but I don't think this is the full system.
2940,qs2QcycggWU,That was so informative 👏 thank you so much
2941,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. Other fields of engineering apart from my own are always so interesting to learn. I suppose that's only on the surface, as actually studying them in-depth would be as painstaking as my own discipline."
2942,qs2QcycggWU,Good communication skill and funtastic explanation.
2943,qs2QcycggWU,Science is amazazazing.
2944,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are awesome
2945,qs2QcycggWU,"I am making content about seafarers' experiences, struggles, challenges onboard. What I found out that seafarers on cargo ship experiences a great toll of homesickness,boredom, and unhealthy mental health condition. And it is a consensus amongst seafarers that, with proper use, internet will create more positive feelings. I hope,this starlink will soon be available in cargo vessels."
2946,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't.
2947,qs2QcycggWU,nice
2948,qs2QcycggWU,great
2949,qs2QcycggWU,Intrest
2950,qs2QcycggWU,goodbye star gazing. this is sad
2951,qs2QcycggWU,This is Insane Loved it soo much
2952,qs2QcycggWU,I can't sleep now knowing all the technology going on in our dishy that sits directly above our heads on the roof. Amazing video and graphics. Thank you!
2953,qs2QcycggWU,Dem
2954,qs2QcycggWU,What a time to be alive!
2955,qs2QcycggWU,"Nobody and nothing goes into ""outer space"" as described. It's scientificly and geometrically impossible."
2956,qs2QcycggWU,Can you elaborate?
2957,qs2QcycggWU,"@@hobogrifter Geometrically impossible: Orbital telemetry is based on the radius value of the earth being 3959 miles. They need the R value for the ""orbital"" telemetry. Scientificly: We have gas pressure on earth. It's 14.7 psi at sea level. The necessary anticedant for gas pressure is a solid container. Gravity doesn't contain gas pressure. If you want to know more about it, just ask but some folks get super freaked out about this discussion about their belief system. Thanks for asking. Be well."
2958,qs2QcycggWU,@@hobogrifter The radius value being 3959 miles has been debunked thousands of times. Outer space travel is a science fiction belief system that was literally started from science fiction stories.
2959,qs2QcycggWU,"​@@slow-mo_moonbuggy Explain to me kiddo, why there is pressure gradient in atmosphere when you  go up;)"
2960,qs2QcycggWU,@@slow-mo_moonbuggy Secondly why I can track every Starlink satellite with my telescope? Why it is always where site says it should be?
2961,qs2QcycggWU,@@tgstudio85 A gas pressure gradient requires a solid container. Provide a citation of a physical experiment of gas pressure without a container. I'll wait.
2962,qs2QcycggWU,@@tgstudio85 Still waiting. Surely you should be able to quickly locate that citation. Another pretender clown bot boy.
2963,qs2QcycggWU,"This is all magical how it works.  We've come a long way from dits and dashes on a telegraph wire.

Thank you for showing us this fascinating technology."
2964,qs2QcycggWU,"Surely the plagiarising commies have already acquired pieces of these equipment and  were able to reverse engineer them, making some innovations and voila, make another good business!"
2965,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, tech!"
2966,qs2QcycggWU,"While not exactly an electronics engineer myself, I am still really impressed at the level of detail you go into with each aspect of the technology whilst maintaining an excellent level of clarity throughout. Bloody impressive. Both the technology and this presentation of it. Credit: Rex Lucas - I plagiarised your text..."
2967,qs2QcycggWU,"It is amazing how everything we take for granted is loaded with deep layers of systems, history and science. I can't wrap my head around everything that was explained but I am in awe of all the solutions brilliant engineers have come up with to solve these complex problems. And thanks to this channel, we get a peak behind the curtains. Truly astounding!"
2968,qs2QcycggWU,Your video is always quality
2969,qs2QcycggWU,"you are really doing great work by serving this best education ,god bless you,thanks."
2970,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, even their satellite dishes are super complicated and I love it."
2971,qs2QcycggWU,It's the first time I'VE seen a video suggest to speed up the video XD I was going to do it either way at 1.25x but yeah.
2972,qs2QcycggWU,"Ahh, the antenna array works like a crystal lattice😅"
2973,qs2QcycggWU,More free advertising for Elon Musk. Fucking cheap ass bastard.
2974,qs2QcycggWU,"It crazy how at the end of the day, our modern world works because of a force of nature that we can manipulate, but still don't understand-- namely electro-magnetism and its movement."
2975,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm so Disappointed and Upset that I've Never known about this channel, Luckily this video popped up in my suggestions.
I Don't think I've Ever seen such an Amazingly Beautiful Video on such a complex subject. The Graphics, The Simplistic Explanations, The ability to cut through the fat and make such a concise video that makes perfect sense and the Fact that Even more info was put in the Closed Captions (Canadian) is Next Level!
This Channel creates videos that Huge Media Companies would spend Tons of Money on with a Team of Hundreds of Employees and still wouldn't come close.
This channel should be Mandatory Viewing in schools and Funded by the Department of Education or something similar!"
2976,qs2QcycggWU,And they say there are no ALIENS in space! All this technology came from ALIENS!
2977,qs2QcycggWU,So does it independently function on its own solar power for offgrids? Or is it expected to run plugged in to energy source?
2978,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful and information video 🎥 ☄️
2979,qs2QcycggWU,awesome
2980,qs2QcycggWU,Unbelievable episode. Perfect.
2981,qs2QcycggWU,"In 3:27 of this video says more than 10,000 satellites are in the space right now. But try to google to prove he is wrong. Then how can I continue watching it, if don't took a good research about this?"
2982,qs2QcycggWU,Best Detailed Video
2983,qs2QcycggWU,"The best so far. So simple, yet so complex. Magnificent work!"
2984,qs2QcycggWU,很详细
2985,qs2QcycggWU,one word.. brilliant
2986,qs2QcycggWU,"I retained only 2 words in this 28m-minute vid: Dishy McFlatface 😅

🤯"
2987,qs2QcycggWU,many thanks for sharing
2988,qs2QcycggWU,I want to go back to school
2989,qs2QcycggWU,I am a senior in Electrical Engineering and this video helped clarify some thing that I didn't fully understand.  Very well done putting all of this together!
2990,qs2QcycggWU,"I read that ""phased array"" is used for the monstrous 5G weapons planted beside schools, hospitals, health clinics, and houses. And it penetrates human and animal bodies, and is deadly."
2991,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, thanks!"
2992,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content and your ability to keep it highly technical yet easily grasped. Thx!
2993,qs2QcycggWU,I wanted to know how the modulation of phase & amplitude is done
2994,qs2QcycggWU,THANK YOU. MAY THE ONE BLESS YOU.
2995,qs2QcycggWU,"THANK YOU, TO THE STARLINK AND THE SPACEX. BUT, WHY MY MOBILE PHONE HAVE PROBLEM VERY OFTEN. BUT, IT IS NOT HAPPEN​ ALL THE​ TIME. THAT MADE ME UPSET ABOUT THIS SO MUCH. EVEN IF I PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE INTERNET SIGNAL EVERY MONTH TO THE​ TRUE COMPANY IN THAILAND, I DO NOT KNOW WHY, WHEN I GO TO THE TRUE​ SHOP TO PAY  THE MONEY​ FOR THE SIGNAL, IT WORKING GOOD, BUT WHEN I GO BACK HOME IN THE​ ISLAND, IT HAPPEN AGAIN.CAN YOU TELL ME, WHY, WHAT WRONG TO MY MOBILE PHONE?. BUT WHEN I ASK AT THE TRUE SHOP, THEY SAID NOTHING WRONG WITH MY MOBILE PHONE.!."
2996,qs2QcycggWU,Complicated Topic with Simplified explanation. Hats on  to the team of this 💯❤️
2997,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for explaining <3 .
2998,qs2QcycggWU,"Omg, it blows my mind 😮 I love this channel so much!"
2999,qs2QcycggWU,"BS, satalites in ""space"" don't exist, they can'tget past the firmament. They are called sataloons. NASA is the biggest consumer of helium and there are giant balloons carrying these satalites."
3000,qs2QcycggWU,"Kiddo, you seriously think that low level trolling will do?"
3001,qs2QcycggWU,"@@tgstudio85 Still waiting for the citation of a physical experiment of a gas pressure gradient without a container. Maybe Professor Dave has a video showing that. Oh that's right, he doesn't."
3002,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn man, this so futuristic..mAgnificent"
3003,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting
3004,qs2QcycggWU,Who came up with this system? Genius.
3005,qs2QcycggWU,"I really learned something tonight. I had NO clue how it worked.
It s 3:54 am , l don’t care l lost some sleeping time .
Honestly l don’t think humans invented this technology. Must be some tech found in an crashed alien spaceship somewhere
Thanks from France ❤"
3006,qs2QcycggWU,"Big brain dude talk'n big brain things. Awesome. The 2% or so I comprehend is interesting nonetheless.
Thx!"
3007,qs2QcycggWU,ang sakit sa ulo potaena
3008,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you.
3009,qs2QcycggWU,Woooow 💯!!
3010,qs2QcycggWU,This is really very interesting...
3011,qs2QcycggWU,"2 Qs..first: does it not affects the aerospace or an aircrafts..because with these very very high frequencies could it be possible that it could affects the signalling system or whatever term they used for an airship to travel safely?
second: how about in tropical places on earth or mostly in a sunny days where heat is too much for a device to get overheat..does one model for a specific country fits to all?"
3012,qs2QcycggWU,"Just a curious question.. Does having more than 1 dish amplifies the internet speed since it'll have more antennas? Let's say if I have 100 Starlink dishes interconnected to each other, and theoretically the Starlink router can handle it, will the speed then be 100x?"
3013,qs2QcycggWU,10% share non nego thanks
3014,qs2QcycggWU,Next video detailed breakdown of a stat link satellite.
3015,qs2QcycggWU,Cool and informative video 👍

3026,qs2QcycggWU,https://youtube.com/shorts/koL9-EKmTWI?feature=shares
3027,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic explanation.
3028,qs2QcycggWU,"Is there any evidence that Elon Musk was actually born on Earth, and not sent to us from an advanced civilization either outside of the solar system or in the future? We can only hope that the motive is to save us."
3029,qs2QcycggWU,Is it weird that I understood everything that was shown and discussed?
3030,qs2QcycggWU,excellent video
3031,qs2QcycggWU,How will Tesla Pi phone be connected to Starlink ?
3032,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing ♥️

3034,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
3035,qs2QcycggWU,It's basically radio. How is that cool? You GenZ's ain't too bright
3036,qs2QcycggWU,"So full of babblr, no one could learn a thing from this video."
3037,qs2QcycggWU,Can one take a starlink and create a small military radar from it?
3038,qs2QcycggWU,my knowledge and curiosity boosted with this explanation... im blown away.
3039,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing info!
3040,qs2QcycggWU,.
3041,qs2QcycggWU,No wonder this is so expensive but really worth it. Thank you for educational video of starlink :)
3042,qs2QcycggWU,📡🌐🛰🇪🇺🇺🇸
3043,qs2QcycggWU,We are no longer interested in US's things. We are tired of being bullied by them.
3044,qs2QcycggWU,Only receiver hestia
3045,qs2QcycggWU,uhmm 15 shooting stars ?
3046,qs2QcycggWU,"That's mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯  
Animation and explanation are too good. Lots of love for explaining this 💓💓"
3047,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely amazing technological advancement
3048,qs2QcycggWU,"by the way, I believe I saw 12 shooting stars!  Thanks for doing that.."
3049,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW...this was amazing...my brain is not equipped shall we say to really understand it but whomever the people are who did do this, amazing...I watched because I've know about Starlink for some time now so thank you for the excellent way you provided the info to everyone.  Yes, keep it up."
3050,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
3051,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing. My brain hurts but amazing.
3052,qs2QcycggWU,The earth is still flat.
3053,qs2QcycggWU,This is way beyond my level of comprehension . This looks like 3rd year engineering course
3054,qs2QcycggWU,I don't understand english well . But I understood almost everything shown in this video.Thank you a lot .
3055,qs2QcycggWU,Marvelous ❤️
3056,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best videos I've come across in a while!
3057,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. I'll be back :)
3058,qs2QcycggWU,".as a noob who knows nothing, i applaud this video. very informative. :)"
3059,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink and the USA have no right to put these satellites above us, it’s terrible! Who knows this magnetic fields impact to human health!"
3060,qs2QcycggWU,airport cafe airport cafe airport cafe ............ mayday mayday mayday ....... brace
3061,qs2QcycggWU,No wonder why most scientists' heads are like dishy
3062,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! My mind has been blown with this video. One of the best explanatory video in technology I have seen, excellent content and marvellous animation. Thank you for making it. Keep up the best work."
3063,qs2QcycggWU,That's amazingly awEsomE
3064,qs2QcycggWU,"In my final year of Engineering, while watching this video, I finally feel like all I've been learning in school is in fact useful 👌 😅 . It's all about application, which is where I feel universities need to do more of, I'm guessing that's  why there are Masters and PhD programs

Finally also understand why upload speed sucks, hopeful for future technologies that will access that"
3065,qs2QcycggWU,These waves heatup the environment and effects on human health or any other species birds honey bees etc
3066,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate the effort you guys put into allowing us to learn such amazing things without brain breaking research!!
3067,qs2QcycggWU,this was amazing info....thanks
3068,qs2QcycggWU,How does this technology perform during weather disturbances and solar storms?
3069,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing in depth description and very easy to understand. Well done. liked, subscribed and commented to help the channel to create more of these 🙌"
3070,qs2QcycggWU,Very impressive  graphics and simplified descriptions. I can see why it took months to produce!
3071,qs2QcycggWU,I will never see my Starlink antenna the same again. Amazing technology. 😆
3072,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
3073,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, As an Electronics engineer. I found this video amazing and interesting. You have explained and visualize in the best way and very understandable specially to those people who are not in this field. already subscribed and hit the notif bell. Want to see more interesting videos like this. Kudos!!!!"
3074,qs2QcycggWU,Elon is a genius
3075,qs2QcycggWU,The maintenance of starlink equipment in the outer space must be  cost billion of bucks
3076,qs2QcycggWU,nice video
3077,qs2QcycggWU,This is an incredible opportunity for students to learn more about this kind of technology. Thank you for the high level of quality and work.
3078,qs2QcycggWU,Great animation and explanation - enjoyed the video and got the summarized view of this amazing technological advancement.
3079,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is amazing!
3080,qs2QcycggWU,"Just wow, super cool technology decomposition"
3081,qs2QcycggWU,"A single satellite doesn't make sense, it makes sense if a group of satellites communicate between each other to adapt to the dishy's field of range when one satellite leaves and another comes in contact. Secondly, the satellite should also communicate with the data centers through satellite dishes to connect to the internet servers."
3082,qs2QcycggWU,"I dont know if this is to impress given the complication, but it will surely be expensive frim the given info only on the capital and operational expenses itself"
3083,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology. It makes the price of the hardware seem like a great value.
3084,qs2QcycggWU,TLDR: Not that well
3085,qs2QcycggWU,is it harmful if exposed longterm with these types of dishes?
3086,qs2QcycggWU,👍👍
3087,qs2QcycggWU,"Does that work even with supertyphoon? And just like wifi router, you cant carry it anywhere, meaning I can only use internet using starlink in a specific location?"
3088,qs2QcycggWU,I miss electronic engineering 😢
3089,qs2QcycggWU,Good work 👍
3090,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video the animation was well put together.   I really enjoyed watching this! 👍🏽❤️
3091,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this amma go build one now
3092,qs2QcycggWU,"Bullshit, satellites are just balloons."
3093,qs2QcycggWU,How about if cloudy or rainy wheather the performance is affected?
3094,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool stupidy mind-blowing crazier fantasy video!
3095,qs2QcycggWU,"you could've summarized all of this explanation in one simple sentence : ""it will be expensive for ordinay people."""
3096,qs2QcycggWU,"Great balance of technical accuracy and accessible narration on the topic combined with tremendously helpful animation, kudos"
3097,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video👏
3098,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, This is the residential Dishy I assume? Is there a video about the Dishy used for the Business solution? The High Performance Dish? I believe this connects to multiple Satellites at any point in time? How many built in antennas do the business Dishy's come with?"
3099,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome!!!
3100,qs2QcycggWU,"how it connects to the data center, does each satellite having a connection between each"
3101,qs2QcycggWU,Quite incredible actually. It reveals just how much of a genius Musk is.
3102,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.  wonderful
3103,qs2QcycggWU,This technology has been there for over 80 years but still amazing
3104,qs2QcycggWU,"Que gran explicación. muchas gracias por este video. Great video, Thanx"
3105,qs2QcycggWU,Very very thank you!!!
3106,qs2QcycggWU,thanks. 🙂

3117,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
3118,qs2QcycggWU,Finally a real world application of what I learnt in University. This is brilliant!
3119,qs2QcycggWU,The problem is….  The people building it are untrustworthy.  If you wanna put people like this between you and your data.  Good luck

3121,qs2QcycggWU,"Wao awesome, also explains why upload speeds are sub-par via the dishy 👍"
3122,qs2QcycggWU,"Very impressive video, great job! As a PhD student working on metamaterials and transmission array antenna, I want to make one minor correction. At around 7 min 30 seconds, the video mentions that the electrons are pushed to the patch antenna. This is technically not true. The displacement currrent formed between the feeding line and the patch antenna is created by the oscillating electric field instead of physical movement of electrons. I know it is hard to explian displacement current to general audiance, but physical movement of electrons means surface plasmon, it can only be true for very small antennas under the optical frequency (surface plasmon resonance)."
3123,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work
3124,qs2QcycggWU,This is a whole semester!
3125,qs2QcycggWU,Love this.
3126,qs2QcycggWU,All of this engineering and design so we can watch porn in the woods.
3127,qs2QcycggWU,I am a fan of this video and am going to keep abreast videos of your channel.
3128,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks ❤
3129,qs2QcycggWU,I work with side lobes to do my hackings 😅
3130,qs2QcycggWU,awesome
3131,qs2QcycggWU,elon fired this guyyyyy and he decided to leak everything bout starlink.
3132,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown. 🤯
3133,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing and i totally understood. A very well made video describing how Starlink works👍
3134,qs2QcycggWU,"It's fascinating how these patterns of constructive and destructive interference act as a bunch of mirrors, allowing the main beam to exit thru. I was on the edge of clarity when my neuron receptors went off phase and stopped firing!"
3135,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm really grateful to everyone working on such material, it makes it really easy and interesting to understand!"
3136,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much 😁. What a fantastic detailed video it was ❤️. Just loved it!!!
3137,qs2QcycggWU,"What an incredible video. The animation alone is crazy, liked and subbed !"
3138,qs2QcycggWU,"Coolest thing about it, Elon restricted Ukraines use of it so they can’t use it to attack anything on Russian soil kicking off WW3, which seems to be what Zelensky wants along with a never ending supply of our money."
3139,qs2QcycggWU,"Bullshit,  their satelloons in the dome earth is flat! Space is a lie."
3140,qs2QcycggWU,I was mind blown!
3141,qs2QcycggWU,It works coz the Russians are still letting it slide and havent shot them down yet and disabled them thats how Starlink works 😂😂😂😂 💪🇷🇺
3142,qs2QcycggWU,Great work
3143,qs2QcycggWU,The content you make is superb. High quality in every aspect and easy to understand. Thank you!❤
3144,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic Vid!
3145,qs2QcycggWU,The labour & research. Hats off.
3146,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder how the skies would look like if we could actually see the beaming
3147,qs2QcycggWU,"Such a very juicy video, full of facts and simple examples to help everyone to appreciate the technology.  Thanks for this great work!  I watched this twice but I did not see the details of dishy shifting from one starlink to another.  Maybe on another video.  Thanks!"
3148,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing
3149,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You! You've made such complex technologies ... Interesting and easier to understand 👌👍👍
3150,qs2QcycggWU,NERDish........
3151,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this video. You have really answered a good part of my questions. I am wondering what protocols are used between the parabola and the satellite. Is there any  specific format? Is it new protocols ? Which layer in the OSI model ?
3152,qs2QcycggWU,"Not 10,000 in orbit more like 4,000"
3153,qs2QcycggWU,Why not show the geostationary satellite near 2:08 properly?
3154,qs2QcycggWU,Chinese engineer desperately watch this video
3155,qs2QcycggWU,There are 26 shooting stars in the video :D . The Insane technology and incredible way of presentation of explaining it all.
3156,qs2QcycggWU,Wow seems like postmortem of technology's .
3157,qs2QcycggWU,Good job.
3158,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing ! Salute to those who created this vidoe and research. I love Science!
3159,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
3160,qs2QcycggWU,very interesting
3161,qs2QcycggWU,This is a video video man
3162,qs2QcycggWU,"It also works on Planes, ships and Rv's."
3163,qs2QcycggWU,It does not magically work. If you're a Christian or an idiot who doesn't believe in science or technology then it's magic. But if there are some rules you have to follow to get it done then you can get it done with hard working money. Not through little pixies or fairies or giant asshole of a God sitting in some distance sky.
3164,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine half the human population ever born was intelligent enough to create this kind of technology. We would be travelling to other galaxy by now or who know what else.
3165,qs2QcycggWU,Yea thats the way it should be and it is fantastic 🎉. I am a layman but I understood the entire aspect and I am excited. Want to know more. Thanks.
3166,qs2QcycggWU,"Impressive 👍 superb content , excellent animation and explanation 👌 👏 👍"
3167,qs2QcycggWU,"Love it ❤! This video triggered a question, Why didn’t I get into physic in school. Physics is fun 🤩!"
3168,qs2QcycggWU,"Musk gets it to work ok. He gets an idea, starts production, then does a market survey. With no takers, he gets money from government and proclaims a success. Piece of cake."
3169,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video. Thank you!!

3171,qs2QcycggWU,My interest is in being a reseller in the Sub-Saharan region
3172,qs2QcycggWU,Explained difficult things very easily
3173,qs2QcycggWU,It works by overcharging everyone. I thought this was supposed to be affordable internet for everyone. It's basically extortion for anyone who wants internet but can't get it the usual way.
3174,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
3175,qs2QcycggWU,"very interesting, educating and mind blowing. keep it up"
3176,qs2QcycggWU,Wow

3189,qs2QcycggWU,Hey Elon Kenya Needs Net
3190,qs2QcycggWU,Soooo at what point do we start orbiting way too many satellites? I mean that looks like a complete mess to have that 10k starlink satellites intertwining around the globe. What happens when the next company wants to put 20k satellites in LEO? Pioneers get the dibs?
3191,qs2QcycggWU,Been on the waiting list for 2 years plus.

3200,qs2QcycggWU,Worth taking the time to comment. The level of detail in this video is beyond most things you see. Thank you for the time you invested into this. 28:08
3201,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing🔥
3202,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful work!  You just got another subscriber.
3203,qs2QcycggWU,It's  over  my Head!!
3204,qs2QcycggWU,I was already wowed by starlink.  Now I am amazed.
3205,qs2QcycggWU,It seems live around earth orbit  will get you even faster internet.
3206,qs2QcycggWU,Super cool and not that hard at all.  Thanks!
3207,qs2QcycggWU,Just gorgeous!
3208,qs2QcycggWU,It was 👍
3209,qs2QcycggWU,Wrong all signals come from phone towers or submarine cables under sea no such thing as satellite
3210,qs2QcycggWU,Electronics is crazy. Nice engineering video.
3211,qs2QcycggWU,Loved the video. Thanks!
3212,qs2QcycggWU,How does it change direction of the waves to point to the satellite while also changing the wave length to sent specific bits of data? won’t the change in wavelength for sending data affect the positioning of the beam?
3213,qs2QcycggWU,Of course this video blowed my mind!!! Love it and thanks for the ton of work you've put in to make this understandable ! 🙌
3214,qs2QcycggWU,Idk why i am commenting but you deserve what you asked
3215,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive. I am a long retired electronics engineer and found this video as clear and compelling an explanation of a complex system as one might find by a truly gifted instructor.
3216,qs2QcycggWU,"excellent video, thank you"
3217,qs2QcycggWU,Was this narrated by an AI voice? Just curious
3218,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes mind blown, liked, subscribed, and commented! lol"
3219,qs2QcycggWU,😍😍😍
3220,qs2QcycggWU,"more like drones or weather balloons , satellites do not exist. the temperatures these things are supposedly flying at would melt them."
3221,qs2QcycggWU,it's a scam.
3222,qs2QcycggWU,"Confusingly awesome, seems the guys that upgraded this aren't from earth"
3223,qs2QcycggWU,Very complicated
3224,qs2QcycggWU,"ok this is probably the most sophisticated topic for me, my respect to the people that make it happen and take time to apply this in the real world."
3225,qs2QcycggWU,"OMG, i already love electronics but maaaan, this is literally the best video explanation of a topic that i ever seen. Glad to have found this channel"
3226,qs2QcycggWU,"Rather silly concept.  94% of the planet is uninhabited. 80% of the rest is already covered by fiber.  The remainder is mostly too remote and too poor to afford satellite internet.   Then there's the inefficiencies:  the satellites are idle for 97% of their orbits, yet they only last for like 4 years, so they get very little use, probably not enough to even pay for themselves.  Even Elon says Starlink 1 is marginal.  I would not put any money into this."
3227,qs2QcycggWU,like learning a pc when first out for sale. new words too use
3228,qs2QcycggWU,This is an AMAZING video and end to end explanation of everything works! Very well done!!!
3229,qs2QcycggWU,"You, guys, should add a bottle of wine to the ""Recommended Watching Instrucions"""
3230,qs2QcycggWU,Musk's satelloons hard at work with helium..........
3231,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice basic introduction to steered microwave signals. 

I have one minor quibble. It is rather easy to see the effects of phased signals - but at light frequencies. All you need is a laser, a beam splitter and a few mirrors."
3232,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing
3233,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing !!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
3234,qs2QcycggWU,awesome
3235,qs2QcycggWU,"turns out i really didn't need to know how it works, excellent video!"
3236,qs2QcycggWU,"As always, the Brach Education team takes time and effort in what they do. The details and animations are top-notch."
3237,qs2QcycggWU,"simply mindboggling, the material, the explanation, the animations all top notch. Looking forward to more stuff like this"
3238,qs2QcycggWU,"Oh brother. You lost my faith that you would be factual. The ""regular"" sat TV satellites do not orbit at all. They are geostationary."
3239,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative, I feel like a star link engineer right now"
3240,qs2QcycggWU,Incredibly amazed
3241,qs2QcycggWU,"Astonishing science and awsome vídeo. 
Subscribed.
Tku a lot"
3242,qs2QcycggWU,"oh my gooooddd, it was such a perfect ever detailed wideo i have ever seen, thanks for creator and helpers very much, it was soo midnblowing, BUT easy to underdstand))))). I would make it underlined and bold but i cant, it deserves a lot of likes and subscribers, thanks again=>>>>>♥♥♥☺☺☺☺☺☺☺"
3243,qs2QcycggWU,So can the system track the satellites to provide an uninterrupted stream if Dishy is not on a fixed point?  E.g. on a moving vessel at sea?
3244,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work!!! Top level stuff👌
3245,qs2QcycggWU,How does it determine to send which data to where or how does dishy only read the data that is sent for them only?
3246,qs2QcycggWU,A lovely blend of existing technologies. Also a lovely accessible explanation of phased array which I knew of from military radar but had never pondered.
3247,qs2QcycggWU,"If my Physics, Mathematics and Computer teachers used such animations to explain concepts then we would have so many STEM students in the world. So easy to understand for someone who has ABSOLUTELY no background in STEM subjects. Being a software programmer I totally applaud the detail in the video."
3248,qs2QcycggWU,I wish I had real life applications like this while at school I would have take wave propagation much more seriously rather than bare minimum only.
3249,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent, is there a video for how satellites work on this channel?"
3250,qs2QcycggWU,Ooh my God this is explicit details... well explained at every step not forgetting the outstanding animation 👏... I wonder what tool was used to create these animations.🤔 any ideas 💡? On the tool?
3251,qs2QcycggWU,Wow 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
3252,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
3253,qs2QcycggWU,"After a career in telecom, I am totally impressed with the brilliance of this presentation and product."
3254,qs2QcycggWU,I am impressed.
3255,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, that's a lot of knowledge in a small box, impressive. Thanks for taking the time to explain this, that was a lot to cover in groudbreaking tech for such a big deployment."

3257,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the content!
3258,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!!!!
3259,qs2QcycggWU,"Judgeing by the high latency and the poor sound transmission as well as the high buffering, Starlink is not worth the expense!"
3260,qs2QcycggWU,I'm honestly just commenting because you asked for it and I want to support you :)
3261,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work, well cause of sun stuff it works with 40 less satellites."
3262,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video. My mind is blown.
3263,qs2QcycggWU,Amazeballs
3264,qs2QcycggWU,Simply mind-boggling!
3265,qs2QcycggWU,How does someone even figure something like this out
3266,qs2QcycggWU,I'm blown away by the complexity of this antenna and the whole Starlink technology.  Branch Education does a great job explaining this to the common people.  Thanks.
3267,qs2QcycggWU,If Star Link was flying around a round and spinning Earth don't you think you would lose your signal after it fly's away from your location and is now being blocked by the round Earth.
3268,qs2QcycggWU,I can assure you that the Star Link satellite is hanging from a weather balloon way higher than the storm clouds where there's no wind.    It gets launched and goes up and then once it's way past the altitude of any clouds it just hangs there for years and doesn't move because there's no wind.    The Earth is Flat and Stationary and Immovable.     Elon Musk will need to send a new Star Link satellite up to a high altitude once the old one becomes obsolete or wears out.     That's all it is Folks.    All satellites are hanging from a weather balloon.    Do not accept the Lies.      It says in the Holy Bible that SATAN will try to Deceive us.    There's no space.    We live under a Firmament that GOD created and there's no way to get past it.
3269,qs2QcycggWU,amazing. i am not doing shit professionally compared to this …
3270,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you so much, am fascinated by star link internet.where is all this data being stored?  from BW.Botswana,Southren Africa"

3275,qs2QcycggWU,I am not a techie but honestly I am quite impressed and a bit overawed. This is very well researched video that is presented in a manner that even  novices like I can appreciate the complexity and genius behind Starlink technology. Good job!
3276,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating 🖖 Very well presented and educational.  The graphics are excellent. Thanks. 👍
3277,qs2QcycggWU,I owned a home theater business 25 years ago.  I first sold and installed C Band satellites. (the big 10 foot dish)  Aiming then was a big project.  To own one was owning the Cadillac of the industry.  The quality and amount of channels was considered way better than cable.  Star Link and how it works is blowing my mind.  Having it continually changing between moving satellites without even a blip in signal or having to move and recalibrate is amazing.  In the last 10 years I was a consultant traveling all over the US and I would sit on the plane wondering how that flat disk less than 3 feet in diameter on top of the place is picking up a signal so good when where I lived an 8 foot stationary dish was marginal. I know digital signals helped. Towards the end of my business I was selling Dish Network and Direct TV but to track on a moving vehicle going 500 MPH blew my mind.  Now it is completely mind boggling.  You explanation is great.  It is so captivating.  You go into just enough detail.  THANK YOU.
3278,qs2QcycggWU,amazing explanation 👍👍
3279,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent Work!
3280,qs2QcycggWU,"okay, hold on. 20:53 - why is there a need to recalculate every few microseconds to facilitate precise beamforming towards the Satellite? don't these Starlink Satellites travel in a predictable orbital path? once that relationship between Dishy's coordinates and its assigned Starlink Satellite's Orbital Positioning has been established, isn't that already predictable?"
3281,qs2QcycggWU,"The coordinates of the satellite is definitely well known,  it's just the phase shifts to get the proper beam forming angle needs to be recalculated, and distributed through the pcb."
3282,qs2QcycggWU,This is extremely helpful as we welcome starlink to Nigeria
3283,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You. Very insightful.
3284,qs2QcycggWU,How does the use of phase shifting to encode the data impact the phase shifting used for beam forming and direction?
3285,qs2QcycggWU,My background is in electronic engineering. I've watched thousands of YouTube videos and I've never seen a more professionally made and complete video as this one. Just enough detail to not be overwhelming but complete enough to get the thought across. Excellent.
3286,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is kinda cool
3287,qs2QcycggWU,👍 Absolutely agree.  I was able to follow everything as explained.  Graphics helped tremendously. 😎
3288,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative and engaging content, even for someone with no background in the physics concepts. Please create short courses around these educational videos,... I'll be the first to subscribe!"

3290,qs2QcycggWU,This is by far one of the best animated and explained videos I've seen on this topic! Also I really appreciate that shared how long it took to make this. As someone who does a little post production for a hobie I like knowing the process and time it take to make these kinds of video's. Great job! Thankyou Youtube Algorithm for this.
3291,qs2QcycggWU,Idk
3292,qs2QcycggWU,"H.264 encoding is used from the latest military drones, but they don't beam-form.  Higher QAMs are used in all digital communications, from cell phones, to cable modems and DSL over telephone lines.  H.264 compresses the digital signals to fit the more important data in more bits, and the redundant data in fewer bits.  I am retired now, but had a fascinating career working with all of these.  I started with IBM 360 assembly language programming, and ending up working on a 256 processor chip.  It was great!"

3312,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for the effort to put out this information. It gave me a headache, but I know can say that in a general way I more or less understand how the starlink satellite internet works."
3313,qs2QcycggWU,"Just a minor nit to pick.. ""broadcast"" satellites which are geosynchronous (fixed in one spot in the sky) are wrongly depicted as non-synchronous (i.e., moving across the sky) at 2:00 to 2:12,  2:28 to 2:32, and 2:48 to 2:60"

3328,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent informative video👌👍
3329,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, it is clear how much work went into this and that work paid off"
3330,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi and thanks for the video, Starlink is truely an amazing technology, in Seychelles where I live, Internet is like a luxury and our providers whilst they promote their internet tend to lie to people's faces and a lot of people are quite gullible or simply may not understand, our biggest problem is internet speed and its painfully slow for several providers, they only offer faster speeds for people who sign up for capped internet and those packages are not good in my book. Another provider Cable and Wireless has released some other packages whilst faster and call it unlimited lite or unlimited ......, it's really not, they give up to 30GB per day for the more expensive package, and around 20GB per day for  cheapest plus any unused data is none transferable to the next day, it's a rip off and if we give it several years and evolution in technology working with internet such as gaming these data caps would be largely  insufficient, I have enough of those BS and patiently waiting for Starlink operations to commence in Seychelles, I believe the speeds would be way way better than our providers local offerings."
3331,qs2QcycggWU,beem me up Scotty
3332,qs2QcycggWU,"Excelente video, muy entendible para todos. Genio!!"
3333,qs2QcycggWU,"These videos are impeccable, I can only imagine the work that went into it. I adore these videos, and learning from them is a treat. Thank you."
3334,qs2QcycggWU,Best animated video on this topic. I can watch it over and over
3335,qs2QcycggWU,Everything at my house ends up having lighting come in on it. I'm sitting here wondering how long it will last.
3336,qs2QcycggWU,Got it. Makes sense 100%
3337,qs2QcycggWU,This was very helpful. Starlink just launched in Nigeria and this video really helps me understand a few things about it.
3338,qs2QcycggWU,Stell.mal so ein ding hier hin ich sag dir was man besser machen kann
3339,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink satellite internet work? IT FUCKING DOESN'T.
3340,qs2QcycggWU,"How does Starlink work here in Oklahoma? It works GREAT. I have had Starlink service since 2021 and it has been great even from the start in its ""Test"" phase. The first year we had a few service lapses for a few seconds every day, never noticed if you were streaming video so I had to look up the info to even know I had a lapse in service. Now, we only get interruptions in service for a few seconds each month. I even get service during stormy weather with only a few exceptions for a few seconds every year now. So I am 100% satisfied with service and you can even travel with a satellite on your RV or boat. I highly recommend Starlink."
3341,qs2QcycggWU,Ty
3342,qs2QcycggWU,great details. thank you for posting this.
3343,qs2QcycggWU,"This is fantastic work, I have been working in the Telecomm/ Satcom industry for over 25 years, in my beginning days @ Motorola back in the 90's, 16QAM was the new thing back then, been working with 256QAM for few years now and applied to all sorts of comms devices, I do like the beam forming and steering technologies of Dishy, thats superior technology."
3344,qs2QcycggWU,So cool!!! Thank you!!!
3345,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!!
3346,qs2QcycggWU,yeah this really tickles my brain.
3347,qs2QcycggWU,W ill this get me a warp field engineers ticket ?

3351,qs2QcycggWU,That’s 💩 to my coming to the wire 😂 lmfao 😢
3352,qs2QcycggWU,"duuude, this video is amazing. great job! The extra comments idea on the canadian subtitles is cool but kinda impossible to follow while hearing"
3353,qs2QcycggWU,Staggering just Staggering...!!!
3354,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic!
3355,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best lesson I've ever get online. Is there a way some one can get physical class or participate in the research....
3356,qs2QcycggWU,"This is what is meant by ""education is free"". Thank you guys"
3357,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely incredible. Thanks for the effort!

3364,qs2QcycggWU,"So, in other words it’s alien magic!"
3365,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you sir for such wonderful comment. i'm commenting the first time on youtube just for your dedication.
3366,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
3367,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible!
3368,qs2QcycggWU,Meanwhile I get 10mbs down and .7 up and have to pay 70$ a month. Gotta love the monopoly on internet access
3369,qs2QcycggWU,"this is a great channel, thanks for such great  videos, but always  make sure you dont simplify to far to a point where the info in the video isnt really true, im sure this is pretty ahrb with the youtube algorithm tho"
3370,qs2QcycggWU,"I really appriciate you put into the research, also explained the concept very well."
3371,qs2QcycggWU,Youtube 3am algorithm be like
3372,qs2QcycggWU,its just creazy how good you created this video <3
3373,qs2QcycggWU,this is a very interesting explanation! Thanks a lot!!! I was looking for information how exactly electromagnetic waves can be done and now I easily learnt it in a few seconds!!! I also understood how to stear the wave-beam using the interferences and the phase-shifts in each antennas. So thank you so much!
3374,qs2QcycggWU,Bullcrap there are no Satelittes that float around our heads in space EXCEPT weather balloned devices.  Lol  the starlink satelitte is  a hig fat lie. The dish is simply picking up GROUND BASE SIGNALS.
3375,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, Thx"
3376,qs2QcycggWU,watching how does starlink work is cool since im connected to my new starlink i just hooked up.
3377,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing
3378,qs2QcycggWU,"This video and your channe ljust a miracle buddy,thanks for every info you given to us <33"
3379,qs2QcycggWU,Very insightful and big thanks to this channel!
3380,qs2QcycggWU,"well well  well im out of words, im amaized by everything in this vid, from animation to the simple detailed explaination. Dishy is so inspiring cant wait to istall one."
3381,qs2QcycggWU,Aweosme
3382,qs2QcycggWU,Way to go!
3383,qs2QcycggWU,Now if their tech support just worked
3384,qs2QcycggWU,"Instead of moving it just have multiple and remove the motors have a alot of ground satellite 🛰  ,this way we only use wireless and manual change of which can receive which field of wave. Who am i. Any way why do hard than make it simple,and signals work better in a calm environment less heat wave can improve signal."
3385,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely incredible. I want to know all the science behind this 😂 is brilliant actually gonna teach important theories behind this or is it your average ad bs
3386,qs2QcycggWU,Hola

3388,qs2QcycggWU,It's amazing technologies
3389,qs2QcycggWU,How much does this cost to buy or use Internet?
3390,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the educational video
3391,qs2QcycggWU,"they say 20ms on starlink
but ive had it since day one years ago and its never been 20.
20 to the dish in orbit maybe.... but the internet isnt actually in space theyre relay dishes, so 40 is the absolute minimum.
the sats are more like ""mirrors"" between the home dish and a relay station on the ground."
3392,qs2QcycggWU,comment for the algorithm
3393,qs2QcycggWU,Just Magnificent
3394,qs2QcycggWU,Huge thumbs up!

3414,qs2QcycggWU,All those satellites that fly over the Russian Federation must be shot down
3415,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
3416,qs2QcycggWU,A comment for appreciate
3417,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
3418,qs2QcycggWU,This is awesome!
3419,qs2QcycggWU,great video! Well done for the work to make it happen
3420,qs2QcycggWU,"Great educational channel , lovely appreciated ! 🙏❤️"
3421,qs2QcycggWU,"Had  Elon  bend a Black  South African  people would be burning Teslas on the streets for what he has done with Tweeter,,."
3422,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video
3423,qs2QcycggWU,How in the world did they even test any of this
3424,qs2QcycggWU,Too much signal.physics i need more time to digest 😪
3425,qs2QcycggWU,This is marvelous 😎
3426,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant Video, Animation, explanation.   1000/10"
3427,qs2QcycggWU,"OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG i see a lot of hard work done by a bunch of genius, blow my mind"
3428,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
3429,qs2QcycggWU,0:05 beaming internet from middle of the woods?  You mean to the woods not from...
3430,qs2QcycggWU,It’s both. How do you think it gets back to space?
3431,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind boggling! Very detailed, thanks."
3432,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
3433,qs2QcycggWU,Soo awesome 🤑
3434,qs2QcycggWU,"Blaaaahaaaahaha!hahaaahaaa
 Brainwashed people actually believe this !!!  Anybody wanna buy a bridge ??"
3435,qs2QcycggWU,Awsome video! Simple and intelligible.
3436,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for this enlightening video. It's amazing how it all works perfectly. I heard that there is a communication taking place between satellites using a laser beam. If I'm not mistaken, any idea on how that works?"
3437,qs2QcycggWU,"3D ...I am learning how my mind functions and controls the body, depending on how we condition it. It all reflects through us what is going on in us.!! Life is Science or it Science is life?? Beautiful."
3438,qs2QcycggWU,is the 540Mbit/s shared between all Dishes? What if each satelite hast to cover 1000 dishes?
3439,qs2QcycggWU,the quality is outstanding
3440,qs2QcycggWU,This cut of video has brought so many information. Am wondering how much more there are with the full length if it's not being cut.
3441,qs2QcycggWU,Digital currency 💲
3442,qs2QcycggWU,How do we saturate the signals if we have two nearby dishes?
3443,qs2QcycggWU,Yes me lord
3444,qs2QcycggWU,im in awe with the video and more awe with the channel. thanks. u deserve my patron.
3445,qs2QcycggWU,Just awesome! Both the technology and the quality of your explanation.
3446,qs2QcycggWU,Speed of light is way too slow
3447,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video. Thanks!
3448,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing tech and amazing educational videos, if I was government I'd contract you to make videos on full middle, high-school and colleges curriculums."
3449,qs2QcycggWU,WTF IS A KILOMETERRRRRRRR 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
3450,qs2QcycggWU,"Simply doesn't work, why so much effort for almost 0 revenue?"
3451,qs2QcycggWU,very cool
3452,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology!!!
3453,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, great video. Hopefully you will continue this set of videos. I am very interested in hearing how the Starlink satellite works, particularly how the satellites relay information through the constellation to later hit a ground station(s) and connect to the terrestrial network. I would also like to hear about how lasers (using light for data transfer in the vacuum of space) get used for connections between satellites."
3454,qs2QcycggWU,"It's very helpful, thank you..."
3455,qs2QcycggWU,"Wondeful 
content"
3456,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
3457,qs2QcycggWU,🤩🤩Thats very dope
3458,qs2QcycggWU,"The only thing I didn't understand is how Phase Shifting can be used both to steer the Beam and to arrange bits in that grid, at the same time. Don't they conflict with each other?"
3459,qs2QcycggWU,"They all ground based, like 99.9% of data and communication is transferred over sea cables. They can't charge you that much if you know everything about the mainframe. Their vendors and work partners are key. People believe they can see satellites with their naked eye, but no one sees any satellite pass by the moon with their telescope. The idea that their size is small is a narrative that is false because of that. Are their naked eyes stronger than any telescope? No, nobody sees satellites like flies passing by the moon. Only the ISS is visible while transiting the moon, but that is another story. People only observe what they are told to."
3460,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video.
3461,qs2QcycggWU,Good
3462,qs2QcycggWU,"This was a wonderful presentation. I am a physics masters, and so loved to see the application of electrodynamics. I marvelled at engineering to apply the physics behind. However, having said that, your presentation and commentary in explaining the complications is par excellence."
3463,qs2QcycggWU,"Mars is the new America. Elon Musk is Christopher Columbus. Space is the ocean. America is trying to have the strongest navy, in the galaxy"
3464,qs2QcycggWU,I love how everyone thinks the United States military is letting Elon musk shoot thousands of satellites into the sky and it’s all for free Internet service 😂
3465,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a new gold standard for online education, bravo, thank you!  And please make more!!!"
3466,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
3467,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank u for your kind information and the 3d demonstration is obviously pretty good. 
When I learn this in theoretical i am very sure that there are no chances of understanding these kind of high level technology."
3468,qs2QcycggWU,"Good job
And thanks for this awesome video"
3469,qs2QcycggWU,This is an excellent well articulated learning stuff. Kudos!!!!!!! Thank you.
3470,qs2QcycggWU,I always wondering how much power does Starlink Satellite require? Is it enough power with just solar panel?
3471,qs2QcycggWU,"No, hence they need to charge and turn off systems every now and then to get battery back.

Technically there is more with the group of satellites since they are swapping between each other as well as sending signals to one another.

Mechanically, starlink is costly to maintain outside of just making more of them and launching into space.

Technically you need a medium rocket launcher to get those systems up there though (which also require engineers)"
3472,qs2QcycggWU,very much informatic video which have a brilliant explanation.
3473,qs2QcycggWU,Just amazing. So m any concepts super simplified and demystiffied
3474,qs2QcycggWU,"Please get the basics correct. Satellites orbit in the same direction Earth rotates, which is west to east, and should have been counter-clockwise in the videos. Geostationary satellites do not zoom around the planet; they orbit at the same rate Earth rotates taking them 24 hours to make one orbit. Hence they are geostationary. They do not beam TV signals; they transmit digital data, some of which is video."
3475,qs2QcycggWU,"As a video producer/editor working to bring complexity in another academic field to the people, the quality of the presentation here is truly jaw-dropping! The fun part is this tech is what allows me to do my job at all."
3476,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! Astonishing technology, pity there have been no studies showing 5G does not cause harmful effects to humans or the environment.

It's a disgrace the way it's being rolled out! Pharmaceutical companies would not be allowed to introduce a new drug without extensive testing. Greed is the only reason for rolling out this technology as fast as possible. 

Big deal being able to download and watch a movie on a smart phone. Who wants to watch a movie on a smart phone anyway?

What little research has been done consistently shows harmful effects to living organisms. Why is it this research is being ignored? Money the root of all evil."
3477,qs2QcycggWU,I counted 15 stars. Am I right or did i miss something?
3478,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good explanation, ❤️"
3479,qs2QcycggWU,Hat off
3480,qs2QcycggWU,"As a retired Electrical Engineer, I greatly enjoyed this video. It might have been made for the laymen, but it was a great primer for the technology for me as well. Well done."
3481,qs2QcycggWU,"this is crazy, thank you for you're videos"
3482,qs2QcycggWU,It was just WOW! The best and deep dive tech content for this topic I've seen. Great job!
3483,qs2QcycggWU,"Since we use phase differences to differentiate between symbols being sent or received, how is phase differences even used for focusing signals in a particular direction? Wouldn't changing phases to steer signals also change the symbols being sent?"
3484,qs2QcycggWU,"How will these sensors feed electronics  last in -275:F ,  10 G at high speed of space, life span VRS ROI ?"
3485,qs2QcycggWU,如此精确清晰高质量的科普动画，特别优秀的团队，非常感谢博主的分享！
3486,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Video.
3487,qs2QcycggWU,Wow amazing vide!
3488,qs2QcycggWU,I'm Sooo proud of myself for understanding all information in the video from the first time.
3489,qs2QcycggWU,Thx 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
3490,qs2QcycggWU,"I don’t think Elon Musk knew all these, probably he gathered some physicians and engineers and simply told them “I want a satellite internet, here’s the money, go make it happen”."
3491,qs2QcycggWU,Helder verhaal!
3492,qs2QcycggWU,"I knew that phased array radar systems and 5G are different forms of this beam forming but it is amazing of the compact scale to send and receive to space, truly incredible.👍"
3493,qs2QcycggWU,"What is the average speed now in early 01/2023 and what is the future speed for the max of giga Bits?  I am in central Texas and ISP like spectrum cable Ethernet, AT&T always reap off in price and always cheating us in billing.  I am planning to go to StarLink"
3494,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome topic and amazing video in all respects !
3495,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting also, for me as an Amateur Radio enthusiast.

We use phased antenna arrays sometimes, mostly on much larger scale/wavelenghts.   (2-3 antennas instead >1000)   - but this explanation is very well made indeed, i learned a lot.

many thanks
OG4U"
3496,qs2QcycggWU,simple technologies well explained. Sharing to my six years old.
3497,qs2QcycggWU,Nice and detailed explanation
3498,qs2QcycggWU,Ukraine if fighting and kicking off Putin war . They need waiting enough points of where just select buttons the same time. Attacking few points not enough powerful to kick enemy go out of your country. If you have perfect weapons in your hands
3499,qs2QcycggWU,Why Does not  American government create system machine for destroying satellites of Putin war if they can . That can make Ukraine reach the winning as soon . We need to know exactly where Russia satellites go. I think this could do it . We need punch up space wide for check and do. Eagle can watch sheep from Heaven but sheep can’t watch up side clearly.
3500,qs2QcycggWU,because that would cause kessler syndrome
3501,qs2QcycggWU,awesome graphics
3502,qs2QcycggWU,"Please  do not use word ""complex"" again and again in your video"
3503,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the information. It impressed
3504,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks,"
3505,qs2QcycggWU,I enjoyed the brilliance of this presentation.
3506,qs2QcycggWU,This is the most beautiful explanation ever a complex technology that Starlink is. Thank you very much!
3507,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology 😮
3508,qs2QcycggWU,tv satellite doesnt spin arrount the earth as shown on video
3509,qs2QcycggWU,That was epic ❤
3510,qs2QcycggWU,"Having this level of video quality, explanations and animations which can let you understand hard topics such as antennas or magnetic field in half an hour for free is mind blowing. This is the true potential of this platform and this channel is one of the most interesting and well made in the whole YouTube. Outstanding video really."
3511,qs2QcycggWU,Nice video.
3512,qs2QcycggWU,We need  some starlink in trinidad and tobago ppl
3513,qs2QcycggWU,What amazing about this video is how the man who is reading this script he on point i love this video
3514,qs2QcycggWU,This is my favorite channel.
3515,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown!
3516,qs2QcycggWU,"I watch a lot of educational YT videos, but this one blew my mind beyond anything I’ve seen. well done."

3518,qs2QcycggWU,Superb video
3519,qs2QcycggWU,Can't compare the quality of this video with even Netflix or Discovery shows! This is at its own level! #HatsOff to the team behind this
3520,qs2QcycggWU,incredible.
3521,qs2QcycggWU,great work here
3522,qs2QcycggWU,On timestamp 22:22 BE convinced me to like and comment. Great video! - Finally someone made in depth explanation of Starlink inner workings I was looking for. Also props for math equation which are in too small quantities in YT tech materials.
3523,qs2QcycggWU,"I need to visit Egypt, absolutely mind blowing that my ancestors we this advanced."
3524,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely love the effort and depth of these videos!
3525,qs2QcycggWU,Loving it!!!!!!
3526,qs2QcycggWU,Information overload I'll have to watch this several time to grasp all the information provided. This is highly informative and well-presented thank you.

3530,qs2QcycggWU,I really apreciate the effort you put on making this video. This is just incredible! congratulations
3531,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the details of the complicated system but 10.000+ satellites is a very bad idea. A private company owning them is much verse.
3532,qs2QcycggWU,DAY-TUH
3533,qs2QcycggWU,"I watch a lot of educational youtube and this is one of the most well-written, polished, and thoughtfully animated that I've seen in a very long time. I have a physics background and I'm really impressed how you were able to boil down the insane complexity of starlink down to something most people can understand."
3534,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic!!!!!
3535,qs2QcycggWU,Great information easy learning….
3536,qs2QcycggWU,"Bravo.  As a PhD EE performing R&D in FMCW radar I have never been able to explain to lay people as you have.  The next time someone asks what I do, I'll say here's the link that explains it"
3537,qs2QcycggWU,Wow - just wow
3538,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video! Thank you!
3539,qs2QcycggWU,"If the phase of the signal is used both for directing the beam and encoding the content, how do these 2 processes not mess each other up? That's the only part I struggle to understand, everything else is brilliantly explained."
3540,qs2QcycggWU,"That's a great question, leaving this comment here so I can be notified if anyone replies"
3541,qs2QcycggWU,I wondered about that also.... time to do some research!
3542,qs2QcycggWU,"well no the phase itself does not have an influence on direction, it is the difference in phase positions or in other words the phase shift that steers the beam. So all the antanes have the same phase frequency but a different phase shift. Remember, shifting a phase only changes the delay (when it hits top or bottom) of the wave and not the actual speed or frequency of it."
3543,qs2QcycggWU,"🤤 phase shift 😵‍💫

Can you buy these?
Looks so cool 🤓

>Five shooting stars<

3544,qs2QcycggWU,So great
3545,qs2QcycggWU,super film
3546,qs2QcycggWU,"Goodman natural disasters of all kinds including human. We desperately need an emergency communication system. I would like to see a network infrastructure. Which used the existing level to commercial channel, part of the GPS specification, riding over the top of it with a non-interfering coding. A very low bandwidth. But data channel. That could be received by every handset built in the last decade. As they currently process the L2C channel. For some additional reach, tuning the satellite, but information wise it's largely unused. So the correct coding cannot interfere. Take this broadcast signal that for standards reasons and interoperability reasons among 10 decades of cell phones built. Will all receive the same broadcast channel. So every handset around the world will receive it. Consider that every cell phone tower. Is booming out its signal at a strength That is strong enough to reach low earth orbit plus much more. So as every starlink satellite passes through the cell tower transmission. It takes the text messages and drops them into the L2C channel. That every handset will receive, drop it into a circular buffer, and when unique, pass it up the text message stack. We're all current social applications, for legacy reasons still support their initial transport of text messages. So that's the downlink outbound channel. And the uplink is any handset that sends a text message. Because that too will be likely with some probability to be received by one of the circling starlinks. And And then down linked broadcast using the L2C, where consider this a basketball team, where you want every player to touch the ball at least once. And once the player sees his own text again. It knows that it's been reliably received everywhere. Latency is terrible, bandwidth is miserable. But it's measurable and durable and anti-fragile. And all from to addresses are unique, as assigned and ranges by the ITU. So attribution of the sender is guaranteed. Which makes this effectively a parallel party line in text messages to every handset around the world. Where in every handset the social applications work using compatible, for legacy purposes  text message service, making every handset its own server for all of its applications that are text-based. Think Twitter and Facebook. Where are the handset can retain a month or a year's worth of text messages, even more if #selected. Which devolves to a series of from phone numbers to filter. So given every handset is its own server for every application that can run on only text messages. In the clear or not. But if not there's a horrendous key management problem, and legacy compatibility issues. Wherefore most social networks, privacy can't be guaranteed about the best you can do is integrity. Which is more than enough for human to human communication. And there's just not that much texting in terms of bandwidth needed, or number of messages per evond around the world. Gigabytes, not terabytes of  weeks if not months of text messages. Where in actual use only post of the last month are of any utility. And if you really want a database search or a large content. You can go find a high bandwidth network. But in the interim you fall back to the old equivalent of telexes. Which the world used to run on without any problem. Certainly enough to manage any transaction related function. And now that everyone knows all the from tos"

SO MUCH TO LEARN. KEPT STUPID SO FKN LONG!!! WELCOME NEWBIES!"
3548,qs2QcycggWU,"Holy shit dude, the animations are scarily beautiful"
3549,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, just wow 👏🏼"
3550,qs2QcycggWU,That Amizing
3551,qs2QcycggWU,"Why would you recommend playing it at a faster speed when the talking tempo is already perfect for processing information? If only kids these days understood how great this style is and stopped doing these ridiculous ""no pauses"" way of talking."
3552,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm watching this video right now with my Starlink, just 5 days using it and it's the best internet for my zone. Others local services can only offer ""20 Mbps"", but you will get actually 14 Mbps most of the time.

With Starlink I can get 160 Mbps or more the whole time, I love it..."
3553,qs2QcycggWU,"Just because childish Musk gives the dish a ridiculous name, I don't think you need to adopt it in a technical discussion."
3554,qs2QcycggWU,Think how much radiation it will emit. Isn't it hazardous for all living things.
3555,qs2QcycggWU,4:48 ON THE PCB👹
3556,qs2QcycggWU,Well done 👏
3557,qs2QcycggWU,"_Elon Musk's SpaceX has built a global internet service with thousands of satellites in space. Starlink, operated by SpaceX, was launched in October 2020. The company said on Monday the service has more than one million active subscribers worldwide. This was up from 145,000 users at the start of 2022._"
3558,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy tracks your home's location at all times.
3559,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is Elon Musk right?
3560,qs2QcycggWU,It automatically started playing at 2x speed...
3561,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellite is *SLOW*

Fiberoptic is way faster"
3562,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually, this is faster than fiberoptic. Especially the further the distance you want to send a signal (like across the world)."
3563,qs2QcycggWU,"Colossal work! (I work in the film industry)

Very accurate tech descriptions, even with simplifications. Such a joy to watch an array previously flown only on air superiority fighter jets now used for civilian internet connectivity!"
3564,qs2QcycggWU,Would you mind repeating that.
3565,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you.
3566,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Great video!!!
3567,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind blowing! Please continue your great work!
3568,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting but what happens to people and animals birds if they get in the way of all of those condensed waves
3569,qs2QcycggWU,I love those animations!!!!
3570,qs2QcycggWU,comment done
3571,qs2QcycggWU,"Something ALL of you fools should ask yourself is this.......   We know that NOTHING can remain up there , regardless of height, unless it has propulsion, and propulsion requires replaceable FUEL ..... but NON of these pretend satellites HAVE PROPULSION.....and neither do they return to earth for refuelling , so why are YOU so easily fooled with all this fake science......and WHY are you so easily fooled every time another idiot tells you that "" We have to show you this in CGI and other make believe horse shit BECAUSE WE CANNOT SHOW IT IF IT DOESN'T EXIST IN REALITY.""   Stupid is as stupid does.....But you are NOT ALONE in this fantasy....Even Trump believes this garbage so you are in good company....but there again Trump believes they landed on the Moon  AND.....He also told the world that the experimental graphene oxide loaded toxic injections WERE SAFE TO USE.....despite the millions of DEAD BODIES everywhere from the idiots who believed him....My guess is that YOU are just another idiot with shit for brains OR , you have taken the governments hand outs to keep this garbage  alive for a little while longer...."
3572,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually, Starlink satellites use ion engines powered by Krypton Gas. Once they run out of fuel, the satellites deorbit themselves. You can literally go to Florida and watch 60 of these things launch like twice a week."
3573,qs2QcycggWU,"so crazy how complex a simple antenna is working ... i cant believe all the physics, all the material-physics, all the mathematics, all the compuuter logics behind it ..."
3574,qs2QcycggWU,لایک داری به مولا
3575,qs2QcycggWU,"Powerfull, the 3D animations make the understanding more ... question is how many satellite are used for a 24hours communication time i.e round the clock"
3576,qs2QcycggWU,well done
3577,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting
3578,qs2QcycggWU,"This was WAY over my head, yet I enjoyed seeing the complexity of such a system.
I have a very teeny tiny itsy-bitsy understanding of QAM and constellations since I dealt with it in my time in a CATV/Internet digital headend, but in no way fully understand it."
3579,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video
3580,qs2QcycggWU,amazing!! and please tell me more more more!
3581,qs2QcycggWU,this is amazing thankd for your vidoe
3582,qs2QcycggWU,I was so much excited of the presentation quality of this video. I would definitely subscribe this channel with notifications on ❤
3583,qs2QcycggWU,"Had  Elon  bend a Black  South African  people would be burning Teslas on the streets for what he has done with Tweeter,,."
3584,qs2QcycggWU,"Studying this in a course is one thing and seeing it with such a good animation of a real usecase is completely different thing. Thanks for making such videos, I am sure lot of effort goes into this."
3585,qs2QcycggWU,But you may agree on that both course level work as well as this type of high level presentations are worth?  One of my concerns is that my son wishes he could do away with university without realising that even E. Musk completed his undergraduate degrees in physics and economics.  Good day
3586,qs2QcycggWU,"@@richardacevedo280 Don't get me wrong. If I have to choose one of them I will always go with University studies. This helped me recollect what l learnt, making me feel good."
3587,qs2QcycggWU,@@muttarameshchandraprem1478 you cannot learn if you cannot visualize yourself in your head
3588,qs2QcycggWU,"@@richardacevedo280 I have a BA in Applied Math And a BS in Computer Science. I too am concerned with the discussion of limiting the math, science and arts to focus on just building electronic devices. The arts do more to push the math and science than anything. An education is a ""total mental"" experience!"
3589,qs2QcycggWU,"Had  Elon  bend a Black  South African  people would be burning Teslas on the streets for what he has done with Tweeter,,."
3590,qs2QcycggWU,"exactly, it is far easier to learn this way, such as an intelligent child could understand."
3591,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, still lost me in parts as it takes good concentration levels to go with the flow.
@Mutta Ramesh Chandra Prem Seeing such good animation is one thing but understanding the heavy math behind it is a completely different thing."
3592,qs2QcycggWU,Great video thanks for the information.
3593,qs2QcycggWU,thank you so much for this video its so informing im a telecom student i needed this thank you again
3594,qs2QcycggWU,"This is amazing, the amount of time and resources that went into this production of this video is mind blowing"
3595,qs2QcycggWU,"20,000 Mbps 2000 Mb/s 300,000 Kb/s multi and unique network since they give us bad service they should improve internet servers and force private companies with strict and fair laws for an internet that functions and 100 percent 24/7 I know they don't care because they are already old but there are young people who think to improve everything like me too who make chips with more power in downloads of 1000 MB/s megabyte per second and 600,000 megabits per second multiple unique in telecommunications we go far back to Spain technology is advancing and you are falling behind chip arm 1000 power + price económic"
3596,qs2QcycggWU,It's too bad Starlink needs an inordinate amount of ground stations. People in chink town could have actually had free access to information for a change. But I guess appeasing ching a ling gov is more important.
3597,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done
3598,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video.  One question that it seems to pose though: isn't the phase and amplitude modulation process used to encode the symbols the same one used to steer the beam?  If so, how can the symbols be encoded without knocking the beam off course?"
3599,qs2QcycggWU,I wish  everyone could imagine technology like this in the future in their mind without the need of videos but with just verbal descriptions imagination is so cool
3600,qs2QcycggWU,balloons
3601,qs2QcycggWU,This must be the best explanation of radio frequency communication especially for someone without a signal processing or EE background. Can you do a video diving into specifically the RF communication fundamentals?
3602,qs2QcycggWU,Really mind blowing content and visualization 🤩
3603,qs2QcycggWU,Porn in the middle of nowhere
3604,qs2QcycggWU,Wow 🤯
3605,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good video Sir, keep it going 👌"
3606,qs2QcycggWU,It seems new danger new challenge for humans and animals 😢😢😢😢
3607,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
3608,qs2QcycggWU,"If they aren't impressive enoughf, I've been seeing youtubers flatmount dishy"
3609,qs2QcycggWU,wire connection fastest why beam XD  loop
3610,qs2QcycggWU,Very well described and amazing video. thanks
3611,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing effort in this video
3612,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Subscribed!
3613,qs2QcycggWU,"I have been amazed by what i've seen on this channel multiple times and you always go out of your way to explain everything in a way thats easy to understand way that makes so much sense. I enjoy your videos and usally watch through the entire video. Thank you for your insane dedication to this channel, cant wait to learn more from you."
3614,qs2QcycggWU,I will love to learn more
3615,qs2QcycggWU,"Huge shame. In no time, these satellites will become obsolete but the pollution will remain. Musk is a clown"
3616,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing. Innovative
3617,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible details.
Thanks for the research."
3618,qs2QcycggWU,Good thing Musk is not a songwriter having to title songs!
3619,qs2QcycggWU,Does this still use the cables under the water????
3620,qs2QcycggWU,No
3621,qs2QcycggWU,"As some one just watching this and trying to understand, I give up lol.  Dam."
3622,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for those hard working videos. 🥰🫡
3623,qs2QcycggWU,"I’ll join in applauding how well this video explains in an easily understandable and well presented way the complexity of the Starlink system. The dialog, graphics, and writing are superb, far better presented than I could could accomplish - and I teach SATCOMS Engineering classes !! WELL DONE !"
3624,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Great content
3625,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Great content
3626,qs2QcycggWU,"22:20 Liked the video, Subscribed & now Commented.
Fantastic Easy & In-depth Explanation With Great Animation. How Good this video is, is just mind-blowing!!! 
Keep making these kinds of videos."
3627,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant video, thanks"
3628,qs2QcycggWU,Question if I'm in the middle of Australia how does it keep connected while the train of satellites is on the other side of the planet 🌎🤔
3629,qs2QcycggWU,Because there are thousands of satellites so there will always be one overhead.
3630,qs2QcycggWU,Every time I watch a video like this... I'm reminded how dumb I am. Don't know how these people have enough time in their lives to learn all of this information.
3631,qs2QcycggWU,This video is amazing!!!!
3632,qs2QcycggWU,starlinks and shit
3633,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, I love this informative video, thank you"
3634,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing detail, BUT I really would like to explore a different aspect.  How many devices supported at any given time by each satellite?"
3635,qs2QcycggWU,Globally SpaceX recently passed 1 million active users and sends up 54 new satellites every week to increase coverage and bandwidth. Each StarLink satellite has 16 beams and can serve 2000+ users.
3636,qs2QcycggWU,"As always, just amazing content. Thanks a lot for your work!"
3637,qs2QcycggWU,Good. Video
3638,qs2QcycggWU,Just we can make something change at 13ghz is insane...
3639,qs2QcycggWU,this is incredible
3640,qs2QcycggWU,MindBlowing :O
3641,qs2QcycggWU,감사합니다.
3642,qs2QcycggWU,"My mind is blown by how great, informative and at the same time simple this video is. Thanks. Now I want to learn the details. Probably will start from brilliant. Thanks for the 20% off."
3643,qs2QcycggWU,So Starlink sends everything Base64 encoded?
3644,qs2QcycggWU,Totally awesome look inside of the technology. Thank you very much for the video.
3645,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks Branch ed! 
Learned a ton!"
3646,qs2QcycggWU,https://youtube.com/shorts/WlXvCqOfBYU?feature=share
3647,qs2QcycggWU,Super amazing and informative video!
3648,qs2QcycggWU,"Guys, you deserve funding. Big time."
3649,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind not blown, understood everything viewing one time at my normal 1.75x."
3650,qs2QcycggWU,I want a Dishy McFlatFace 😭
3651,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing explanation
3652,qs2QcycggWU,When you throw all of the money on R&D
3653,qs2QcycggWU,Great 😮
3654,qs2QcycggWU,Most interesting video I've seen on this channel so far. Thanks.
3655,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely phenomenal video. Fantastic animation only made better by a solid explanation with crystal clarity. Thanks for this.
3656,qs2QcycggWU,"its strange those shitty videos hit a million likes and an informative video like these don't reach so
strange world with even stranger humans"
3657,qs2QcycggWU,Appreciate the effort in these videos
3658,qs2QcycggWU,This is a very detailed explanation. 🎉❤ and it’s awesome.
3659,qs2QcycggWU,我对科技的理解上限是四冲程发动机
3660,qs2QcycggWU,"This is absolutely incredible. Wow, you guys deserve so much praise for all this research and work.. not only for this video but all of your videos are immaculate... thank you for providing this to us for free... without ads no less. I genuinely have no idea how you guys do this so well but just wow. You explain it so understandably.. I don't think there is a channel with anything near the quality and clarity as the videos you guys do. So yeah, all I can say is thank you very very much."
3661,qs2QcycggWU,insane
3662,qs2QcycggWU,"I've never seen beam forming explained so quickly, simply, and succinctly. You guys have an amazing channel and 2 million views hardly seems like enough. xD"
3663,qs2QcycggWU,"Hey, First of all thanks for this  masterpiece . My question isn't spesificly about Starlink but about general internet. What happens when the satellite receives 2 or more signals at the same time? And to seperate and identify users does it use the frequency distrubition technique as well as cellular towers?"
3664,qs2QcycggWU,"What an advanced technology!
Small chips and 2 cm antennas communicating 550 km while we are having hard times to connect 3-5 km away cell phone towers 😅.

Great video and explanation.

Please do more. Thanks a lot."
3665,qs2QcycggWU,awesome video 😍🤘🏻
3666,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome, informative, loved it"
3667,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good video, thank you for the details.👍👍"
3668,qs2QcycggWU,THANK YOU FOR THIS OUTSTANDING GOOD VIDEO
3669,qs2QcycggWU,I am amazed by this video and the work you have pushed into it.
3670,qs2QcycggWU,Just found this channel on Christmas. Best present!
3671,qs2QcycggWU,very good
3672,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this through Starlink!
3673,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful
3674,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome
3675,qs2QcycggWU,Wow 👍🏽 thankyou
3676,qs2QcycggWU,"It is interesting that this antenna tech is probably about 40 years old. First use? Military, ofc. Early warning, aquisition and later aircraft radars."
3677,qs2QcycggWU,In depth study made it easier for us to understand
3678,qs2QcycggWU,excellent learning as a senior citizen not understanding this technology thank you I have subscribed
3679,qs2QcycggWU,Very well explained! Simply excellent.
3680,qs2QcycggWU,More vídeos Please.
3681,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent ! Thank you.
3682,qs2QcycggWU,That’s a great video! Thank you!
3683,qs2QcycggWU,"Perfect video, thanks, exciting time to live."
3684,qs2QcycggWU,jus wondering that if single dish can hear multiple satellites at same time and it is phase array antenna. In theory it can do up stream simultanously to multiple satellites and that way use even less  airtime.
3685,qs2QcycggWU,Doesn't exist.
3686,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, so amazing! Thank you very much for your hard work! Verry well put together and accurate informations about this subject! Subscribed, liked and commented, because I can't get enough of watching your videos! This is so amazing! I remember when I used to study Electronics and Telecommunications in the University, and I can say that my teachers weren't able to reach this level of detail and clarity you go into these videos! Please keep up the good work! Now I can confidently say that I've better understood how antennas and this technology work! Science and technology is so fascinating!"
3687,qs2QcycggWU,Very educational made easy to comprehend! Amazing graphics! Thank you so much!
3688,qs2QcycggWU,Well done
3689,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for making this masterpiece of education
3690,qs2QcycggWU,"Really, Branch Education is a blessing for us who are curious. ❤"
3691,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome videos! Thank you
3692,qs2QcycggWU,21:18  min - That Moment when you 20 Years later understand that Technology which you have worked all day with. OH MY GOOOOD .... THANKS SO MUCH.  :OOOOOOOOOOOO
3693,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are insane.. I wouldn't have imagined this much of engineering even in my dreams.. 😂😂Keep it up guys for such informative animations... ❤️
3694,qs2QcycggWU,There is brilliant science behind ⭐ Starlink 🛰️ satellite internet thanks Branch Education to teach in excellent way. Highly appreciated
3695,qs2QcycggWU,"Also... TEAM WORK, THERE IS NOTHINGVLIKE TEAM WORK... It one of the lesson in the video"
3696,qs2QcycggWU,"This is mind blowing, tears almost roll down my eye tears of excitement... I wanna say thank you to the engineer for their great minds and ultimately thank you to God for blessings of great minds."
3697,qs2QcycggWU,"This technology is used to hack humans brains via BCI, RNM and V2K technologies. Elon Musk is a front man for DARPA and high up military. They use this technology to zap people into committing crimes so they can take away the 2nd amendment. They ZAPPED BLM so hard that they were murdering people on the streets. It's not healthy technology like it's being spun to you all. Please wake up!"
3698,qs2QcycggWU,"Please keep doing this kind of videos, this is gold content, thanks!"
3699,qs2QcycggWU,"Here comes your role, to explain such a interesting topic in interesting way"
3700,qs2QcycggWU,"Am amazed, even i understood what was going on, wow, this video is a masterpiece, that is for sure. Great Work, you inspire me."
3701,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown
3702,qs2QcycggWU,Very Insteresting i love science i always had  a curiocity to know  things i love star and i think elon musk is a geniuos for doing the starlink and all tecnology like tesla  since it hyas internet and starlink send signal he will have everybodys info
3703,qs2QcycggWU,Damn! Freakin Amazing.
3704,qs2QcycggWU,"Super duper, perfect 🥰"
3705,qs2QcycggWU,great information sir very deep 😇😇😇💯💯💯🌹🌹🌹🌹
3706,qs2QcycggWU,"I think that ""suggesting"" to watch it twice at different speeds is a tiny bit scammy but ok, your content is worth overlooking that. Amazeballs."
3707,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off!
3708,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video ,anybody here have starlink broadband? And would they recommend it"
3709,qs2QcycggWU,yes my mind was blown. I'm so darn glad I had a bowl of ice cream ( ahhh:rocky road...thank you very much ) with me while faintly listening to some Lead Zeppelin in the background. Great info...thanks man!
3710,qs2QcycggWU,Get enough of them placed by the buyers can create a lot of feature to which the creators are seeking. So many events can be in from this itself and it’s given by those who pay for it. Both sides get the perks but which ones weighs right for the processes in which we all take part in. Love it in it’s complicated simplicity in all forms of intentions.
3711,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely mindblowing! Thank you so much! Hope to see more videos like this.
3712,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. :O
3713,qs2QcycggWU,fourier transformation basically
3714,qs2QcycggWU,I clapped in front of strangers. This is the most accurate looking animation accompanied by excellent explanation. Thanks you team.
3715,qs2QcycggWU,At satellite at 35000kms would be geostationary and not rotating around the earth like in your animation
3716,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
3717,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
3718,qs2QcycggWU,"9:30 i dont understand, normaly, when current runs from + to -  theres an electric field going from minus to plus and likewisde there is also created a magnetic field perpeendiculare to it, whats the differance between that with just a wire and this? what sperarates the 2, why are they different."
3719,qs2QcycggWU,"It's all cool and all, but the fact is that there'd be massive data caps and/or it would be very expensive to maintain and operate."
3720,qs2QcycggWU,"I feel like star link is incredibly stupid (this content however is incrediblyamazing), littering the night sky with satellites which makes studying the stars difficult. There's already so much space junk up there and they want to add SO much more. 😮‍💨"
3721,qs2QcycggWU,i hope this isnt an ai making youtube videos to finance the future takeover of the superior intelligence
3722,qs2QcycggWU,honestly one of the best channels on youtube right now fr
3723,qs2QcycggWU,I hope the hackers turn that antenna into AESA radar and share the project to us.
3724,qs2QcycggWU,Dudee that beam stearing mechanism is awesome... How do people come up with this sort of things.... Mannn these people really are something...!!
3725,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this..

3728,qs2QcycggWU,Some of us live in the US. This metric system might be good for you. It’s not great for us. 👎
3729,qs2QcycggWU,"Liked, subscribed, and now commented. Love the beam steering animations!!! Very educational."
3730,qs2QcycggWU,Great production. Can you make one on Government corruption and how to solve for PI.
3731,qs2QcycggWU,I'm glad the technology we have today and the technology that allowed us to develop today's things was not available during WW2 look at all weaponry that was developed from those engineers especially Germany they were decades ahead of every one else.
3732,qs2QcycggWU,"I was a Microwave electronics technician working in the industry building Microwave amplifiers in the KU band back in the 1980s... Microwaves are magic, Thanks to James Clerk Maxwell, Thompson, Oersted, Weber, Henry, Faraday, Lenz, Heaviside and Hertz who were the pioneers."
3733,qs2QcycggWU,Were those a bunch of paid replies? You guys all sound way too impressed. … Bunch of fucking musk bots.😅
3734,qs2QcycggWU,very informative!
3735,qs2QcycggWU,"I know I sound like an echo here, but this was insanely quality production of the highest degree. The narrated content was incredibly cohesive, clear and easy to understand but the visual 3D animation deserves recognition in it's own right.

Would you kindly tell me what software, team, or company you used to construct the visual content? I would like to put together a quality explainer video like this for a project I'm working on and don't prefer the cartoonist version which seems to be so very popular"
3736,qs2QcycggWU,"Not certain, but it looks very much like Blender, which is free and open source.  And that's awesome!"
3737,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome explanation! Incredible technology
3738,qs2QcycggWU,2
3739,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow well explained, learned one thing and was satisfied. Why dishy doesn't rotate. About all else went over my head"
3740,qs2QcycggWU,you deserve more the like and comment thank you very much from an engineer
3741,qs2QcycggWU,amazing  lesson
3742,qs2QcycggWU,"hey that is very very detailed, well down 
but can I challenge you to do 10-50! antena just as powerful as Starlink's?
i know there are 1300 antennas glued together but I've always wondered if it's possible to just make 1 of them , just 1 as a challenge for DIY if we could really make a similar  or maybe even better starlink dish, can u do that ? from the looks of it 1-10 antenna doesn't sound to be that hard, we could even do it with the extra materials laying around the garage."
3743,qs2QcycggWU,"One antenna would be great, but as mentioned in the video, you would need motors to redirect the signal beam. Using multiple antennas as transmitters, a directional beam is formed electronically without any moving parts. That is the magic of phased-array antennas 📡 ."
3744,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 try 2-10 then :D 
it should be an easy DIY ^^"
3745,qs2QcycggWU,if you succeded then you could multiply it later but that would be  very nice video to watch hence I don't have time to do it myself.
3746,qs2QcycggWU,wonderful❤

3749,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this on starlink from a rental cabin and I’m the only one in the group who thinks it’s mind blowing that this cabin has starlink
3750,qs2QcycggWU,I find phased array technology incredibly impressive and this video is the perfect explanation and animation of how this tech works.
3751,qs2QcycggWU,"Insane Technology! 
I know much of this Technology is already used in Cellular Communications. 
I wonder if this same Technology could be used in other applications such as Autonomous Driving, Medical Field, Extremely Accurate GPS, Military Defense...."

One side question: are these electromagnetic beams powerful enough to interact with bodies in the in between like insects or birds ?"
3760,qs2QcycggWU,Loved the content and ur teaching simplicity u made this complex tech. as cool 😎 and simple
3761,qs2QcycggWU,"Do you know how God works?

You know how a hunk of metal works. Do you know how the Creator of that material your using works?

Your using God's material, therefore He has ultimate right over your precious invention.

If you want nothing to do with the Creator, then go create your own universe out of nothing, and your own planet and own materials so you can build your own toys there."

3765,qs2QcycggWU,"I was wondering if there are any health issues associated with using this technology?  I live in Alaska and was thinking of getting this to use as the phone towers are not reliable as there are only 1 in our area. Also concerned about the health issues having a router in our home as the signal can cause dizziness, nasia, heart palpitations, migraines, among other issues. Just not sure about if it would be right for us . Will have to think on it before but I really enjoyed the expiration and the tech is cool."
3766,qs2QcycggWU,"The spectrum these antennas operate on are too low powered do any harm.
I doubt your router can cause any of the stuff you mentioned."
3767,qs2QcycggWU,"How much is the monthly fee, equipments and installation fees?"
3768,qs2QcycggWU,Initial cost of $599 and service cost of $110 (charged per month). No installation cost unless you want to mount it professionally to your roof. Then you're dealing with an installation cost and the need to buy a roof mount.

3777,qs2QcycggWU,Very impressive. Thank you.
3778,qs2QcycggWU,"Your video so informative and helpful to learn
THANK U 💖 Branch Education 😊"
3779,qs2QcycggWU,Unfortunate that the illustrated satellites in orbit seem to be going retrograde - both starlink and geostationary orbits are prograde - they go around the earth in the same direction as the earth spins.
3780,qs2QcycggWU,Iam always amazed by the skills in making such an interesting and easy to understand videos.. Its a complex massive technology these days.. Thanks for keeping us people in track.
3781,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely the best explanation I've ever seen in wireless communication. Amazing it covered so much so intuitively.
3782,qs2QcycggWU,This video was the most insanely detailed and robust educational content I've ever seen. Excellent work jeez
3783,qs2QcycggWU,"I've just given myself a pat on the back. Not only did I make it to the end, but my eyes were still open."
3784,qs2QcycggWU,Wow wow wow. This is amazingly well made. perfect.
3785,qs2QcycggWU,"this is the kind of video i want to see in youtube, god, is soo fcking good"
3786,qs2QcycggWU,I literally cry sometimes...after looking at this kind of peculiar technology and thinking about how 99% of human beings wont understand the amount of passion and hard work put into it
3787,qs2QcycggWU,That was so simple. I'm going to build one in my garage.
3788,qs2QcycggWU,No more being stuck in the open world like ocean or woods and not being able to watch HD movies🤣🤣🤣only kidding ul actually be able to get help no matter where you are in the world. The guy for 128hrs would still have a arm today
3789,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, thank you for the time you put into making these videos a real knowledge treasure."
3790,qs2QcycggWU,Im grateful that im here to witness you demystify the satellite internet technology ... How i wish this 3D technology and would go back in time when students only read and left struggling to  vizualize such scientific concepts......
3791,qs2QcycggWU,"This is what YouTube should be, full of knowledge, no prank."
3792,qs2QcycggWU,The video explained the how extremely well. Thank you.
3793,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
3794,qs2QcycggWU,"You said that dishy is only able to produce a single beam directed to a particular satellite , so it raised a few questions.
How dishy choose the best satellite to connect to and  how do it switch from one to another , while maintaining a stable connection ?"
3795,qs2QcycggWU,"The position of the dish and adjacent Starlink satellites are constantly  being monitored and evaluated, along with the angle of the beam from the dish to the current Starlink satellite. When the right thresholds are reached, the connection is handed off to the next satellite. I'm just guessing, but believe this happens in the same manner as when someone is driving down the freeway talking on their cell phone. After every few miles or so, the current cell phone tower hands-off the connection to the next tower. This is all done via sophisticated software which works between the cell phone towers, a central processing facility and the cell phone connecting to the towers. The Starlink system works in a similar manner, substituting satellites for the cell phone towers. It's even more complicated though, since the thousands of satellites are orbiting around the Earth, unlike fixed cell-phone towers. Nevertheless, the brilliant software programs manage this complex technical dancing 💃 maneuver in real time."
3796,qs2QcycggWU,Explaining how a Starlink dish switches between satellites would be a great idea for the next Brilliant video.
3797,qs2QcycggWU,How many people with degrees in gender studies did it take to figure all of this out and produce the satellites
3798,qs2QcycggWU,It's like watching movie &background voice is good. I can't wait to another technology vedio keep me posted

3867,qs2QcycggWU,"This must be an ad because what starlink is doing isn't new or special. There are other sat internet providers who has been doing this waaay before starlink. Starlink is merely an option now, and not the best one, niether to the costumer nor the environment. Some other companies use 3 satellites to do what starlink need 10 of thousands to do. The binge time is the only advantage the starlink has since their sats are closer to orbit but that's not something worth the massive negatives that comes with it. Elon is a force of evil and hopefully people will open their eyes to see him for what he is."
3868,qs2QcycggWU,"lol, the enviroment? what species are you trying to protect 500km up in space? low earth orbit satellites not only have better latency, they are more reliable and have better local coverage. non of the companies you are thinking of have the capabilities of starlink, like being jam resistant to Russian radio jammers. it is absolutely the best option with people who can only get satellite internet, how else would they gain 400,000 customers in a year? people like you are a force of evil, you tear down good men doing things no one else has."

3888,qs2QcycggWU,"Informative Video.

However I have 2 questions.

1. Phase modulation between antennas is done to form the directional wavefront. Will changing phase to encode bits will not have an effect on wavefront formation?

2. While explaining single antenna, it was said that they can work as either upload or download link at an instance. However later on it was said that simultaneous upload and download communication take place between satellite and the dish. How simultaneous communication is achieved? Does some antennas work as sender and receiver at the same time? Will it not affect the wavefront formation?

Thank You"
3889,qs2QcycggWU,"In the video, bar charts and several explanations show how the sending/receiving works concurrently, but not simultaneously. The dish works in receive-mode for most of a given time slot, then flips to send-mode, just like two people talking over a phone. Since communicating works the same way for both sending and receiving data, the same circuitry can be utilized, just in reverse direction. This is all explained in the video... I'll need to watch it a few more times myself to get all the details. In computer networking,  alternating between sending and receiving is known as 'half-duplex,' while simultaneous sending/receiving is called 'full duplex' data transmission. So, the Starlink antenna works in half-duplex mode.

For encoding data into the QAM bits while performing the beam forming, I'll need to research how that functions. The narrator briefly explained that, but by the end of the video my mind was already exploding.... hehehe 🤪."
3890,qs2QcycggWU,"Not sure, but when the narrator mentions 'simultaneous' sending and receiving, he meant concurrent data transmission, like two people talking over a phone line. Hence, the Starlink antenna can alternately send/receive data, albeit not simultaneously, unlike full-duplex Ethernet connections."

I think I get 25 MBPS thru centurylink and I can watch 2 movies and troll the web all night long neery a hitch, it's the encoding that really speeds things up, however the ignorance of starlink is its like cellphones, they want to cap your data, then charge you anything over that .. meh, way out in the sticks in maybe worth it for what $125 a month after taxes fee's what not?"

No need to go into full array-factor theory for an introductory video, but still get the point across with the appropriate nod at the end about side lobes and such."

Go to Earth curvature calculator and study it.     The horizon should begin to go down as you go higher in altitude but it never does.     The horizon always stays at eye level.     We have been deceived.    Let go of your Teddy Bear.   They begin lying to us when we walk into kindergarten and showed  us that globe

3938,qs2QcycggWU,These videos are just unparalleled.
3939,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question for you: WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GO TO HEAVEN? According to the Bible, John 3: 5 tells us “..unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.”

You need to be born again in Christ, in order to enter Heaven when you die: that means change your ways and live a righteous life. No one is perfect, but it important to repent everyday, because the worst thing anyone can ever hear is “Depart from me, I never knew you”…and be thrown into the eternity of Hell forever and ever."

3953,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is quality! Can't believe it's free!
3954,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
3955,qs2QcycggWU,The first video I saw from you guys was about the smoke alarm. Then the computer ram was suggested. Took a look at your profile and you gained a subscriber. Really nice job compared to other videos
3956,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!
3957,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind - Blown 🤯 Such details in each step, makes it want to learn the not known aspects."
3958,qs2QcycggWU,great video indeed. instant sub 😊
3959,qs2QcycggWU,"I am not qualified nearly enough to comment on the deep functions of this technology. BUT!! PEOPLE!!! back off the ""wows"", ""way cool""s enough to actually LOOK at what this technology represents!!  Tied with many multiples of terrabyte memory it is a potential freaking nightmare of total, penultimate control of each and every human being on the planet!!! Individually. This video is nothing less than the detailed blueprint of the 1984 plot!!  SOMEONE is intensely working on this stuff every minute of every day. The next step is tying this to AI.    We're dead ... already ... and just are too stupid to know it!!"
3960,qs2QcycggWU,OMG soobscribble
3961,qs2QcycggWU,The content is exhaustive for a regular youtube viewer. But it's definitely a learning platform for an engineering enthusiasts. Keep up the good work Branch.Education.
3962,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video however I have one question. Presumably a singly starlink satellite is recieving input from hundreds/thousands of dishys on the ground at the same time.  This video explains how it works between one dishy on the ground and one starlink satellite, but how does it prevent the data from the signals of 1000+ dishys getting mixed up ? And also how does it transmit the data to thousands of dishys that are in different locations? thanks"
3963,qs2QcycggWU,THIS IS THE BEST EXPLANATION EVER ! 😁
3964,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is great work.
3965,qs2QcycggWU,What a wonderful technology
3966,qs2QcycggWU,"Given there are already almost 5K comments, someone probably already pointed his out. At 2:09 the Geo television satellite should be shown orbiting at the same rotational speed as the earth."
3967,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative and high quality content! Thank for your efforts in the video.
3968,qs2QcycggWU,comment to support👍
3969,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely fascinating.  Great job making an incredibly complex technology more understandable.
3970,qs2QcycggWU,really informative one.

3972,qs2QcycggWU,No place to hide.
3973,qs2QcycggWU,"As I already have high speed fibre internet I had never seriously considered taking up Starlink but I remember thinking, ""Yikes, $400 just for a dish!""
Thanks for the info in this video, I now think, ""Wow, ONLY $400 for that dish!"" Should I ever move to an area with poor to none internet I will feel much happier to pay the upfront costs of Starlink."
3974,qs2QcycggWU,Fuck starlink.
3975,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
3976,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video. Well done!
3977,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation
3978,qs2QcycggWU,🤯
3979,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome content! Dence and clear information! Is there some particular beaming issue in receiving mode? It is clear that when transmitting, antenna array need to ""steer"" the beam but what about receiving? Is there some mecanisme that need to be taking in account to amplify the signal? Or do we only need one antenna out of the array to receive signal?"
3980,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn I can't imagine having to model and animate all this like bro how painful is that and btw I counted  11 shooting stars, also I really appreciate this video and am very astonished on how sophisticated things can get on a small scale"
3981,qs2QcycggWU,awesome explanation
3982,qs2QcycggWU,"I did not hear anything mentioned about how it is limited with speeds because the more users you have the slower it will be as it has to communicate to all the users in an area. so it has limitations, but it is still very cool. figure out how many satelites it would take to provide internet to every person on the planet and have full speeds for service... would there be such a massive amount of them needed that a launch of a rocket to high orbit would have a high risk of hitting one on its way past them? would the destruction of one by a meteorite cause a chain reaction of destruction of all the satelites at this point of saturation to provide everyone with internet? lets not forget about other companies sending up satelites as well... Amazon is sending 3,236 Project Kuiper satellites into orbit, dunno what distance those will be, but the sky is getting crowded pretty fast"
3983,qs2QcycggWU,I would want to understand about communication between multiple satellite and constellation management
3984,qs2QcycggWU,Who exsist that can possibly understand any of this vid
3985,qs2QcycggWU,Laymansterms plz
3986,qs2QcycggWU,Hit me up?
3987,qs2QcycggWU,These bastards have us all in the dark
3988,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for simplifying this. Even though i dont fully understand, i think i get it. I’m a navigator at heart and dream of sailing the world. Therefore my question, would Starlink work mounted to a sail boat? Like on a gimble? So it would mostly point up. Internet on a boat is extremely expensive. Maybe Starlink is as well. I just stumbled across this video. Anyway just a thought… thank you"
3989,qs2QcycggWU,27k km/h is bullshit...
3990,qs2QcycggWU,"this is a fantastic video, very well explained. I finally understand these complicated concepts which I'd expect to learn on a degree!"
3991,qs2QcycggWU,"I think I would have done much better back in school if we had videos like this, as I'm a very visual person.
I can't even imagine how long it would take me to absorb all that information reading it in a book or listening to a teacher trying to explain it.
Thank you to all of you that contributed to this and other videos like it."
3992,qs2QcycggWU,"Educational systems everywhere- globally speaking, are absolute garbage dumpsterfires that are built on crooked groundworks with crooked understanding of knowledge and crooked misconceptions on what methods are best to relay this knowledge... Oh yeah, and they're also currently saturated to the brim with politics.

Stay away from them and question everything you ever ""learned"" if it came from a school."
3993,qs2QcycggWU,Same here. A teacher could repeat the same thing over and over for a month and I would still have questions but show me a diagram and I'm done.

4024,qs2QcycggWU,This is really fanastic way to learn the workings of complex technologies
4025,qs2QcycggWU,11-13ghz .. isnt that licensed band ?
4026,qs2QcycggWU,Very well delivered video. I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer so I was amazed by the details shown in videos. Generally very few videos in the internet give so much detailing (well technically obviously there is a lot lot lot more is going on and cant be explained in such short video). I liked it. Keep the good work going and let the info coming 😀👍
4027,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
4028,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent work but the title has little to do with the content title ""How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work?"" The title should be more like ""How Beam Forming can punch through a radio beam to an orbiting Satellite. The big picture is you are transmitting a stream of data from the ground source and a receiving a stream of data from the satellite. Traditionally, a strand of copper wire does the same thing. 
Here are some of my questions
Is the bandwidth of the signal 64 bits or six as show in the video
In radar, you use the term duty cycle. You listen for data and send data. I suppose you could grab one byte of data and then switch, but assume you would grab 1k of data and then switch modes
You might discuss the concept of modulation where the data is mixed with the carrier. You mention PM or Pulse Modulation and AM Amplitude Modulation, why both ?
Each satellite maintains a session with several dishes at once. I wonder how each satellite can switch(listen,transmit) between each dish on the ground? I would guess each session has a 64 bit ID
I wonder about how each session is started and ended. Eventually a dish gets out of range or in range, how is continuity of session maintained ? 
I know there are lots of satellites. But I wonder how susceptible the satellites are to jamming or DDOS Distributed Denial of Service attacks ?

Again, great work on those antenna arrays. The graphics are especially useful."
4029,qs2QcycggWU,That is so cool what scientists were able to think through and actually also produce!
4030,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a masterstroke. I wish something like this was shown in my digital signals processing class!
4031,qs2QcycggWU,The architecture and infrastructure for the digital prison technocracy ahead of us being marveled at. I guess the guillotine was similarly admired in it's day.

4049,qs2QcycggWU,awesome video. Great work.
4050,qs2QcycggWU,You did a fantastic job
4051,qs2QcycggWU,It’s harder than one thinks.
4052,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of the video and this explanation is unheard of!!!
4053,qs2QcycggWU,"I have been using a StarLink system for about 6 months. I love it for speed but it does have brief outages during Zoom calls and streaming films. The video is truly amazing, incredible and Brilliant. The complexity of the concept and design of the StarLink is mind boggling. I've never seen such a well designed video explaining such a complex subject so well executed. Kudos to all involved. Thank you."
4054,qs2QcycggWU,"Great explanation. However, the animation has several disturbing errors, like it shows traditional TV satellite to orbit earth, while it stays at a fixed position."
4055,qs2QcycggWU,Did you get your award
4056,qs2QcycggWU,Same way as it doesn't.
4057,qs2QcycggWU,Also they were 7 shooting stars 🌠 I counted them while watching the videos .....
4058,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow mind blowing 
But I have one ☝️ question does weather disrupt the frequency and what if airplane ✈️ is flying by dichy"
4059,qs2QcycggWU,Amazed and Astonished by the quality of the video and Elon Musk’s brain.
4060,qs2QcycggWU,guys how 90m symbols turns to 540mbits? and why does the frequency be much faster then the symbols. cuz the data is in the symbols.  24:40

4067,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for these meticulous videos.
4068,qs2QcycggWU,It's really mind boggling to think that I have one of these pieces of engineering right outside my window. I've been lucky to have lived in such amazing times.  Comparable I guess to the invention of the telephone. Greetings from Alaska.

4071,qs2QcycggWU,"I absolutely HATE math from trying to learn pre-calculus and beyond in high school in the 90s but I perfectly understand this video. Unless I can put it into a spreadsheet it’s all witchcraft to me and I’ll admit that my absolute disgust in the witchcraft they call math has really limited me in education and hence career. But as I said before, all the concepts presented here make perfect sense."
4072,qs2QcycggWU,Please Keep Educating us Engineers like this ! I hope one day I would be able to contribute to educational channels like this !

4092,qs2QcycggWU,"For a student, just remember the names and process and pass the exam without bieng bothered by the technological advancements and the level of research and the evolutionary process of ""the revolution"". 🙂"
4093,qs2QcycggWU,My view: Internet is nothing but connectivity but here the connections made using awesome engineering of radio frequency through satellite.
4094,qs2QcycggWU,"Antenna engineering is a whole 'nother field of electrical engineering. At Purdue, I looked at the math and said I am not worthy. Then ending up needing it my whole career, LOL.
Years later I met the fellow that invented the phased locked loop used here in places. We used to swap books; that was like as good as it got back then for entertainment. The TV screen was inside our head. He read about 5 to my one. Anyway, he worked on the radar used in the bomber in WW2. The PLL is why we were so accurate. Back in the day, every 'good' radio had a circuit called 'selectivity and sensitivity' whose function was to be sensitive to certain frequency and less sensitive to all others. That allowed you to 'tune in' to a station. Back then, everything also started by making a crystal vibrate ( interacting with a physical object and colliding it with a physical reaction from a separate source) Same thing here. I am reminded and thrilled to see the same physics applied in new ways and that there is nothing new under the sun. Today, crystals are 'grown', back then they were actually hand cut. And because, they were sold in 'sizes'. That mattered because it took power to tune. less vibration meant you needed more power to move it.
The brilliance are they use man's combined knowledge to do some incredible. Again, bravo Elon."
4095,qs2QcycggWU,Antenna engineering borders on magic. So many variables to consider.
4096,qs2QcycggWU,great explanations!!
4097,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, but where do you buy it or rent it or whatever to be able to hook to it?"
4098,qs2QcycggWU,Díky!
4099,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely incredible video! Thank so much for this!

4103,qs2QcycggWU,it hurts to hear a voice like that telling us the biggest lie which one human may hear without getting electroshock all over the senses! BRO...IMPOSSIBLE FAIRY TALE FOR BABIES 1-8 HOURS OLD!
4104,qs2QcycggWU,"Totally understandable, just like: 

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or a deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.

In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.

The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."
4105,qs2QcycggWU,"Honestly, it's a great way to connect through the internet but, the monthly cost is, well, expensive to be honest"
4106,qs2QcycggWU,You are extraordinary! really congratulation.

4114,qs2QcycggWU,Amazingly well done.
4115,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice!  but , and maybe I missed, How do you convine the phase shift signal to angle de bean and at the same time change to the according phase  to send the value you want to send? It uses phase change to angle the bean and change the phase to change the value of the info send."
4116,qs2QcycggWU,"I also do not usually comment, but I needed to express how impressed I am by the depth and quality of your content. Too many other educational videos take specific technologies for face value and don’t go much deeper than surface level. I appreciate you digging into every process down to the electron level before moving on."
4117,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome Video.
4118,qs2QcycggWU,Best video I’ve seen in a while. Wow
4119,qs2QcycggWU,How many starlink satellites are needed to have continuous internet from one fixed location?
4120,qs2QcycggWU,What a cruel insane thing to dream of let alone execute. Musk is a bad man.
4121,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is just a poem. A poem to physics, to technology, to human effort and human brain. This video, ann all previous are precious and must be translated in every possible language."
4122,qs2QcycggWU,Just heard Starlink was coming to my country. You work gave me more than I needed. Great work!
4123,qs2QcycggWU,even though I can't really understand but I loved it!
4124,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink work?  It doesn't work in my area...been waiting on it for two years after repeated push back dates.  Guess Elon is too busy being the Chief Twit.
4125,qs2QcycggWU,Waww mind😮 blowing
4126,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
4127,qs2QcycggWU,"Informative , Thanks a lot."
4128,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is amazingly helpfull and mind blowingly how much effort made in making such videos. Thank you all for sharing and helping open sourcing education.
4129,qs2QcycggWU,Simply Amazing!
4130,qs2QcycggWU,Tv satellite is going the wrong way. It turns with the earth
4131,qs2QcycggWU,The fact that this video is free is mind blowing in itself. People pay tens of thousands a year to learn this stuff in college... Wow is all I can really say
4132,qs2QcycggWU,Comment
4133,qs2QcycggWU,"yeah, but where do they put the Flux Capacitor?"
4134,qs2QcycggWU,Way too high. Starlink looks like a sandwich 😎🍔

4159,qs2QcycggWU,"But if phasing is used tondirect the beam, how can it also be used to encode data? I guess it's being compensated by other values."
4160,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation 👌

4177,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, the best video I've ever watched to explain the very detailed real design inside the dishy and the fundamental theories that are essential to understand how the Starlink Satellite works."
4178,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!
4179,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing explanation and visuals, complex equations in the simplest form.for the first time i saw the full 28min without skipping(hmm well i skipped Brilliant promo 16:26 to 16:52). content has been well narrated, the monotone of the narrator was cool and less dramatic as it should be during class room. such an advance feet Starlink has achieved in tech in broadband propagation worldwide.  
I wonder if they can be the masters of our world as not they can beam in and out huge data. Low orbit satellites could be a threat to a nation wish SpaceX never gets into any kind of military agreements. Oneweb is picking up but concerns are always there.. Like in Spiderman 1 ""with power comes responsibility"".."
4180,qs2QcycggWU,Poorly
4181,qs2QcycggWU,This is a really brilliant educational video!
4182,qs2QcycggWU,Doesn't seem so expensive now...
4183,qs2QcycggWU,😂 second part .. Watch this video 1.25 first then 1.5 … that’s funny
4184,qs2QcycggWU,Won't the abundance of satellites cause issues with planes or rockets in the future?
4185,qs2QcycggWU,The motors only move the dish during initial setup?!? How am I only now learning this?!
4186,qs2QcycggWU,"The amount of brain power it took to design and build this technology is staggering. The problem is the education standards for today's children has  devolved to such lows that they will not be able to conceptualize or construct such magnificent things like this in the future.  ""2+2=5(because you feel it should be)""  education. Our education goals have been sabotaged in this country."
4187,qs2QcycggWU,TRULY INNNOVATIVE THEY MADE IT WHILE ITS HARD FOR US TO EVEN UNDERSTAND IT
4188,qs2QcycggWU,Even  Elon Musk can not describe it like this 😄
4189,qs2QcycggWU,great explanation

4192,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for explaining QAM. I watched a video explaining cellular technology and didn't get it. Now I have a new found respect for not only starlink but really any wireless communications. I cant imagine how complex 256 QAM would be.
4193,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off to the geniuses that figured this out. Mind is blown!
4194,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing. Literally mind-blowing. Hats of to the engineers making this a reality and hats of to you guys making us understand that it was not as simple as most of us had imagined 🤦
4195,qs2QcycggWU,Not literally. Your mind has not left your skull and splattered on your walls. Use the word 'figuratively'.
4196,qs2QcycggWU,You are the crazy one!😮
4197,qs2QcycggWU,Love ur video. Gave it a like. In a parallel life am a Scientist.
4198,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool. Very interesting process.
4199,qs2QcycggWU,"I am very curious about two things:

1. Does not using phase encoding to carry data interfere with using phase change to form the beam front?  Wouldn’t the beam tremble around with the data it is carrying?  Maybe it is just an issue of scale: the beam-forming phase change occurs over a few minutes while the data-encoding phase change occurs over a few nanoseconds.

2. There are 10,000 satellites, and millions of subscribers.  I assume the mechanics of a satellite’s onboard antenna-array are roughly analogous to that of the ground station’s, but how does one satellite conduct hundreds or thousands of conversations at once?

Beautiful work on the script and animations."

4204,qs2QcycggWU,I am gobsmacked. Well explained and animated 👏
4205,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting
4206,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely cool to watch! I've been working with RF and SATCOM for a while, and it was interesting to see the tech being employed specifically by Starlink. It's interesting to see how they were solving the insane speeds of the low orbit starlink satellites by using phased beam signal steering rather than motors, i've never seen the concept actually used. I wonder how they home in specifically on the band they need to use, does the starlink satellite emit a beacon frequency and there's a peak and pol algorithm on Dishy to lock on (multiple times a minute?) quickly? Would be cool to see how they're doing that.

Cheers! Thanks for the great video!"
4207,qs2QcycggWU,See the way this channel has demystified what looked like magic to me. Thank you so much.
4208,qs2QcycggWU,Does the starlink satellites interact with other satellites like how a normal internet would?

4223,qs2QcycggWU,wow
4224,qs2QcycggWU,how can the phase be used at pointing the laser beam towards the satellite and also to send data at the same time !!!?
4225,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. I love the visuals along with the facts, it makes it easier for me to understand complicated material. Of course, I can't see through whether what is said is correct, but I assume so, and so this video is really, really good. Big kudos to your team for this work. I have now subscribed to see what else you have been up to. It is absolutely certain that jrg will also share with my friends, but only with those who have an interest in technical solutions. :)"

4261,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
4262,qs2QcycggWU,Commenting for the algorithm. Please make physical copies of your videos so that humanity can rebuild after the apocalypse.
4263,qs2QcycggWU,"That is extremely informative content 👍 👍. Thanks a lot 👏 👏
What is still unclear for me from this video is ""phase"" concept utilization. You're mentioning that the phase shift used in order to align the beam to a satellite but also for data sending. But there is only one ""phase shift""(same for ""amplitude"") physically available for one wave, isn't? 
Therefore, is it correct to say that ""phase shifting"" is using twice? And it is like ""summing"" of 2 phases what in result gives one specific ""phase shift"" for each of the small antennas? 
DIFFERENT ""phase shift"" for each small antenna (from the array) in the first place - for a beam positioning, and a COMMON ""phase shift"" at the same time - for data encoding?
Please explain if I'm mistaken in my suggestions (as soon as I wasn't able to understand this from the video)

Thanks in advance and appreciate for the video 👍👍 

Could you please make a similar video about antennas and signal processing from the ""satellite"" perspective. As it might be quite interesting because it serves a millions (if not to say billions) connected consumers/devices"
4264,qs2QcycggWU,"Very well produced, thanks to all the team for your effort in explaining Starlink so well"

4283,qs2QcycggWU,Just wondering if the side lobes are affecting the electronics around the dishie? and also how the whole ting stands against electro-interference. Say if you use the same 12GHZ signal in reverse phase would it cause interference?
4284,qs2QcycggWU,Awesoome!! really awesome!!. It's incredibly how you guys summarize and explain complex things in a simple way.
4285,qs2QcycggWU,this video is great

4290,qs2QcycggWU,"You make a great job, cool animations and very simple language."
4291,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic explanation!!!  The beam steering is based on the Starlink antenna being in a fixed known position and the knowledge of the satellites trajectories.  When installing the Starlink antenna on a drone (in order to steer it or communicate video signals), the beam steering would work no more I suppose???  Or can the GPS position and the antenna inclination of the Starlink antenna be handled as a variable???"
4292,qs2QcycggWU,One would guess the movement of the drone would tiny compared to the satellite.
4293,qs2QcycggWU,@@ohhs7830 I would guess that the lateral displacement of the drone is as you mention not that critical to compensate.  But it is it's sudden angular movements that I guess must be very difficult to compensate for?
4294,qs2QcycggWU,"SO, Will ANY Flatscreen, LCD, or LED Television that is wi-fi capable operate with this system? Or do I have to buy a new TV?"
4295,qs2QcycggWU,I think you can see these satellites traveling across the night sky especially if you use binoculars
4296,qs2QcycggWU,Well explained.. Thanks a lot for ur hardwork..

4307,qs2QcycggWU,"As solid and comprehensive as any hyper-technological explanation can be presented for the intensely interested layman.

Although my life’s work is polar opposite from science and technology, the truth is that a comprehensive and informative explanation of how things work has always served me, and my working knowledge of life’s wonders so well.

Thank You, and the entire team’s dedication and desire to make understanding this rather  large “chunk” of space technology just that much more understood.

Fascinating how going from “normal” to 1.25 then a bump to 1.5 retained the pleasure of learning and the knowledge has now sunk in….Brilliant!!!

Having been held captive and captivated by your presentation I say Thank You so very much.

4309,qs2QcycggWU,Please upload more videos on starllites and antennas
4310,qs2QcycggWU,Hey 👋
4311,qs2QcycggWU,Well done.
4312,qs2QcycggWU,"The ACP Antenna as dissected here is missing some fundamental physics and one thing is the byproduct of this complex activity in the form of HEAT. 
For example, as you have stated--12 GHtz of current is applied thru each PCB. This results in Oscillating Electric Vectors out of which some perpendicular vectors nullify each other but a majority result in Fringing Fields. Simultaneously created Magnetic Fields point in the opposite direction. These two vectors - Electric and Magnetic  - expand in umbrella fashion...all these activities require a constant supply of high frequency current. 
For earthly application of MRI, the incoming power supply of 480 Volts is amplified by X-Y-Z gradients in thousands to create the Electromagnetic field in X-Y-Z planes for a 3D acquisition of the anatomy. For such task, there are special and additional AC coolers placed in the Gradient room and to cool off the magnet of such high calibre, the lazy gas Helium is constantly pumped on to the Nybium-Titanium components.
So, where is such high voltage current coming from in these satellites? I did not hear you address the source of such power. Is it the solar panel that will generate some power and then some internal amplifier would amplify the power to a desired level?"
4313,qs2QcycggWU,Blender 3D?
4314,qs2QcycggWU,"I love that you clarify the specifics, awesome work and the animations are perfection."

Please keep up this awesome work!"
4317,qs2QcycggWU,Excellently explained! Too good!
4318,qs2QcycggWU,This is very educational. The animations are great and provide fundamental concepts
4319,qs2QcycggWU,"If the frequency is only 83 picoseconds, why do we spend a full 10 nanoseconds on each symbol? Couldn't we send fewer wavelengths per symbol? Would it be possible to just treat a single wavelength as a symbol and transmit 120x as much data?"

4330,qs2QcycggWU,I'm glad Elon took it away from stupid Ukraine.
4331,qs2QcycggWU,This is epic - incredible research and animations. Thank you!
4332,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown 😳
4333,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant - both Starlink, and creators of this video! Thank you!"
4334,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for video … 🙏
4335,qs2QcycggWU,I wonder how many flat earthers use starlink and still believe the earth is flat?
4336,qs2QcycggWU,Super amazing video🎉
4337,qs2QcycggWU,aku ngelu.
4338,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent Video, 
Love from India"
4339,qs2QcycggWU,All i can say is WOW
4340,qs2QcycggWU,How do humans come up with something like this... this is insane!
4341,qs2QcycggWU,"Gracias, es la informacion que estava buscando, se me hizo bien dificil encontrar informacion correcta y detalladada de el funcionamiento de starlink. hay muchos videos pero ninguno ofrece informacion correcta.  hay muchos charlatanes que hacen videos caseros  mostrando como instalar una antena pero no tienen la mas minima idea de su funcionamiento."
4342,qs2QcycggWU,If the phase and amplitude changes to equal the value how does that not affect the original beam angle?
4343,qs2QcycggWU,LETS THE NEXT SOLAR FLASH BURN THEM ALL !!!!!!
4344,qs2QcycggWU,your media in this presentation is absolutely incredibly produced!
4345,qs2QcycggWU,Best

4373,qs2QcycggWU,Science my love
4374,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!!!
4375,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant explanation of such a complex matter! I´m amazed by the fact that such quality content can be accessed free of charge. As an Antenna Engineer, I really appreciated the insight given on the multi-layer patch antenna array. Keep up the good work!"
4376,qs2QcycggWU,Nice creation. Thank you.
4377,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, this channel is just awesome"
4378,qs2QcycggWU,"wow, amazing"
4379,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting video and high-quality presentation of information. Thank you!
4380,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful video explanation! Kudos to the creators!
4381,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for this useful information and amazing animation and information 👊 keeeeep it up
4382,qs2QcycggWU,I am blown away! This explanation is a perfect balance between depth and breadth.
4383,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating!! And very interesting
4384,qs2QcycggWU,very interesting
4385,qs2QcycggWU,Great work guys!!
4386,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation!
4387,qs2QcycggWU,"We are apathetic slaves.
This is truely a prison planet."
4388,qs2QcycggWU,"Out of curiosity, how much of a difference is there in capability between the old circular beta Dishy vs the current rectangular Dishy?"
4389,qs2QcycggWU,Tracking system and high bandwidth do to face shift.
4390,qs2QcycggWU,"I comment because your Videos are awesome and I want more of them , Thank You."
4391,qs2QcycggWU,"20:49: 16 Large chips controlling 32 front ends, each front end control 2 antennas, that's....16*32*2=1024 antennas not 1280 antennas as stated at 4:42. Why this difference ?"
4392,qs2QcycggWU,"15:00 : what is use as a mirror ? If it's an actual mirror that that's an optical communication which is not what is happening based on the patch antenna, the environment of propagation etc...

Is it PEC (metal) that is used as a mirror ? PMC ?"
4393,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you ! Great job! looking forwoard to watch more educational videos like that with this simplicity and i can imagine how hard you worked on this. You deserve many views and likes and comments. 
normally do not comment on a video"
4394,qs2QcycggWU,wooow that was so fast half an hour. Thank you🙇‍♂
4395,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
4396,qs2QcycggWU,How does a Neanderthal like me will understand this.
4397,qs2QcycggWU,4:42 : each antenna is controlled by a microchip apparently HOWEVER there are 1280 antennas for 640 SMALL microchip (3:58) which should mean that each (small) microchip is controlling TWO antennas not just a single antenna as said at 4:42 right ?
4398,qs2QcycggWU,What I don't get is how those antennas can operate if they are one on the top of the other one. The transmittion of the bottom antenna is not blocked by the top antenna ?
4399,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, Your work is awesome."
4400,qs2QcycggWU,Very good  and very descriptive. Marvellous work . Keep it up
4401,qs2QcycggWU,Super cool!
4402,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome explanation

4406,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent compilation. Must watch
4407,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the great content.
4408,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for trying and helping a laymen understand this powerful innovation and wonders of science and technology. Beam forming itself is quite interesting  enough. How I wonder the thousand of math formulation that makes this technology exist, so precise and now I imagine such individuals  engage on such multidiscipline is quite a feat for a so called special person...mmmppphh personS....kudos and salute since time immemorial men and women devoted billions of hours in the name of progress and innovation. And to the people behind the channel we thank you for letting us see and hopefully gave us a glimpse (correction so detailed, vivid and tried to simplify it ) of the marvelous power of Starlink Satellite. More power to all of you and hopefully this innovation can help every human being to live a fruitful life but not endangering our environment and other people. Stay safe everyone. Gob bless us all."
4409,qs2QcycggWU,All of the engineering in this system is way crazier than that of 5G cell network systems and their outrageous speeds and computer power needed.
4410,qs2QcycggWU,well done 🛰
4411,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!!!!!!
4412,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Thanks for putting this together.
4413,qs2QcycggWU,"this is top quality education, I am an RF Engineer and I was able to understand everything clearly but that animation was mid blowing, Could share this with my friends and help them understand technology better. Absolutely amazing."
4414,qs2QcycggWU,may I  how 90m symbols turns to 540mbits? and why does the frequency be much faster then the symbols. cuz the data is in the symbols?  24:40
4415,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Thank You! Sub'd
4416,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! I have never seen such a fantastic visualisation and commentary explaining the principle of a patch antenna, kudos to you!!!!"
4417,qs2QcycggWU,why doesn't school teach these amazing technologies?
4418,qs2QcycggWU,Let me save you almost 29 minutes of your life. A thing sends a signal to a thing in space which then sends the signal to you. Pretty simple.
4419,qs2QcycggWU,subscribed 
4420,qs2QcycggWU,We need ir here in El Salvador
4421,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice. Very informative. I was curious about few more things. How does the satellite send data to the ground dish? Does it work like a TV satellite or does it work differently? Also, what is the total bandwidth/capacity of a single satellite or the constellation as a whole? I wish that was also covered"
4422,qs2QcycggWU,Phenomenal video. The density of information in here is astounding and presented in a easy to understand manner. Thank you. Subscribed.
4423,qs2QcycggWU,Mind = Blown
4424,qs2QcycggWU,Can you please do a video on video compression too? Like advance codec like H.264 or files like mkv?
4425,qs2QcycggWU,This s how everyone will see Jesus coming
4426,qs2QcycggWU,Nice explanation and graphics. Great work
4427,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent work. Thanks a lot for the great video. Finally, someone showed a detail of how Starlink works."

4430,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for explaining to us these Starlink Satellite business in an understandable manner. You rock!
4431,qs2QcycggWU,"This is truly mindboggling for the human mind to comprehend! Surely, God has designed the brains of gifted human beings to come out with these technological breakthroughs!!! God is awesome!!!"
4432,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating! What program is used for the animation in the video? -Thanks in advance.
4433,qs2QcycggWU,This is pretty amazing. Thank you.❤ I do however worry about space junk though. I LOVE YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!
4434,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing but excellent way of explaining it. I cant believe humans can reach this level of intelligence
4435,qs2QcycggWU,Brutal
4436,qs2QcycggWU,🤥
4437,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, you made this soo simple while actually covering all the bases. An awesome video."

        -From INDIA"
4441,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
4442,qs2QcycggWU,Please don't show geostationary satellites as moving like you did. That's misrepresentative and confusing to new learners.
4443,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic! Thank you 🙏
4444,qs2QcycggWU,This video and the way things are explained are amazing. Thank you for making such informative videos.
4445,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome!
4446,qs2QcycggWU,"Even with this brilliant explanation, i'm still speechless of the huge science behind it."
4447,qs2QcycggWU,"You explain it in simplest way , thanks your team
I really enjoy  ❤️"
4448,qs2QcycggWU,"i am super amazaed how the technology has improved.
I feel like I am the left behind human who cant contribute anything to the society."
4449,qs2QcycggWU,Great video

4451,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome information made understanding star link so much easier
4452,qs2QcycggWU,This really is revolutionary hi-tech. Elon and Co. are beasts.. Thank you for the educational information. Please keep up the exceptional work. Cheers from the PNW
4453,qs2QcycggWU,"wow, fantastic !"
4454,qs2QcycggWU,funny enough I was already watching at 1.5X then the narrator said that... synchronicities...
4455,qs2QcycggWU,"top, greetings from bavaria."
4456,qs2QcycggWU,"I don’t normally comment on a video , but this one left me totally amazed !! Kudos for the incredible amount of work you’ve all put in this video 🎉"
4457,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
4458,qs2QcycggWU,I wish there had been such videos when I was studying telecomunication 20 years ago
4459,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for your hard work.  Very cool and informative.
4460,qs2QcycggWU,"Isn't it funny when anyone moves the Satellite Dish is Left Behind LOL this is a hoax the satellite is beaming to a pretend satellite in space moving 17,800 miles an hour but your satellite dish is stared in One Direction! Satellites are a myth they are pretend please wake up and get your mind back"
4461,qs2QcycggWU,daghan salamat!
4462,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, thanks. Does changing phase to transmit binary data, conflict with using phase to point beam directly to satellite?"
4463,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding learning video. I learned a lot of things after watching this mesmerizing video
4464,qs2QcycggWU,"Good video, thanks for the really good explanation"
4465,qs2QcycggWU,thank you Branch Education this video really did explain thing i did not know.  looking forward to watching more.
4466,qs2QcycggWU,شكرً كثيراً على هذا الفيديو الرائع
4467,qs2QcycggWU,Cool stuff and blew my mind when he casually mentioned In-Flight Internet is achieved this way . . . wow

4486,qs2QcycggWU,Just absolutely amazing!
4487,qs2QcycggWU,This explanation was incredibly smooth
4488,qs2QcycggWU,This is a AESA radar like unit.
4489,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible show, thank you!"
4490,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question!!!!


In this video i got to know that though the combinations of 6 bit binary code visuals are transferred but how thouse binary are converted into the actual visual that we see on our TV .....,..





HOPE I WILL GET THE ANSWER🙂"
4491,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative and helpful, thanks."
4492,qs2QcycggWU,wow
4493,qs2QcycggWU,"I usually watch YT engineering vids at 1.5x speed but this one went deep into the physics and the animation of waveform propagation was amazing, ike most I'm not a physicist asnda these waveform propagation principles are difficult to learn in a 3 month class, so to have made it this accessible & comprehendible in a 20 minute video is just crazy.

 I had to watch this a couple times at normal speed, especially with the ""English (Canada)"" subtitles to be sure I actually understood the waveform propagations this easily & my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. 

This wouldve taken 2 semesters of classes to get to this understanding, done in 20 minutes! 

This should easily be in the running for making complex abstract principles readily accessible & comprehended. There are few in the world who can do it like this video, definitely subscribed!!  Making complex information accessible & understood by the masses is really a Holy Grail with so much information around us."
4494,qs2QcycggWU,"Хорошее дело ты делаешь, Маск. А я вот который год в кочегарке..."
4495,qs2QcycggWU,"mind blowing and informative, very welll explained pls continue your work very eager for more videos"

4499,qs2QcycggWU,I am absolutely thankful to the effort put into the making of this extremely detailed and hugely informative video.. thank you so much to all that made this a very successful project indeed. Now I can claim to be so much more informed of the numerous processes going on within that dish everytime I see one.. thank you again.
4500,qs2QcycggWU,THANK U. To the bright minds humble and anonymous  people that work and design this! ✨️ including the video production! 📹  thank u for make our life better !●
4501,qs2QcycggWU,Have an idea how to make amplitudes more efficient as well as electron flow
4502,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown! That's it
4503,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing... thank you so much for explaining this. Wow, Wow Wow...."
4504,qs2QcycggWU,"As someone educated at the doctoral level in the Humanities and Social Sciences, who reads journals like Scientific American, which excel in transmitting explanations of the science to us educated in other disciplines, I appreciate the complexity and nuance of the writing in this video.  I was able to follow the physics and basic math well enough to make sense of it and actually comprehend how it works and the finesse of the manufacturing that goes into the machine precision parts of Dishy.  I find also the use of graphics and internet (distance) education takes media-aided teaching to a gestaalt, the next level of thinking.  So how do I invest in Dishy -- are you on the stock market?  :>)  Don't sell your souls to the venture capitalist market!  We need you and there are enough of us, now."
4505,qs2QcycggWU,I totally admire your work!
4506,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely fantastic video. Thank you.
4507,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing video. Just blown away by the gfx and I want to marry the narrator or be adopted by him. Best narrator on YouTube

4514,qs2QcycggWU,wow that antenna system alone is mind boggling ! What's that again? ah-ah my nose is bleeding.
4515,qs2QcycggWU,this is the most detail and analyzed documentary i have ever come across it very educative and inspiring
4516,qs2QcycggWU,"After the first 5 mins, I became a subscriber. best technical explanation video I have seen in a decade of being on youtube! Thank you very very much and please keep the level of quality throughout your videos!"
4517,qs2QcycggWU,👍🏻
4518,qs2QcycggWU,Please do inverter air conditioners too!!! Beautifully done!
4519,qs2QcycggWU,it works by sucking out a ridiculous fee for substandard speeds for shit internet while making Musk richer.
4520,qs2QcycggWU,How much should satellite Internet costs where there are no traditional ISPs or ground infrastructure available?
4521,qs2QcycggWU,"Hola me pareció súper interesante este vídeo, agradezco su realización me sirvió para entender el funcionamiento de estás antenas electrónicas y de cómo transmiten y reciben y me aclaró más el sistema Starlink."
4522,qs2QcycggWU,Elon Musk  should have unlimited budget for that from the world-free world I mean
4523,qs2QcycggWU,Superb video. I always wanted to know how phased array worked.

Please continue to do more videos like it, I'm for sure watching this video a couple of times more to pay attention to details that I missed on the first watch. Kudos to the people that created it!!"
4533,qs2QcycggWU,These days the Yoytube and Tiktok college are much amazed me than those knowages back in school
4534,qs2QcycggWU,Have a look at the signal path channel where the guy does microwave analysis of the dish PCB
4535,qs2QcycggWU,My husband is an EE and watching programs like this with him and our 6yo makes explanations make sense to us!
4536,qs2QcycggWU,im engineer too and its so lovely video he made it easy for people to understand it well
4537,qs2QcycggWU,great
4538,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome work gentlemen
4539,qs2QcycggWU,I presume the beam is circularly polarized ?   RHCP or LHCP ?   so basically crossed slot patch array   ?
4540,qs2QcycggWU,Great work am too informed now
4541,qs2QcycggWU,"awesome, thanks for creating this video"
4542,qs2QcycggWU,"So you can have a connection with a satellite moving at 33.000mph and no connection issues.. Laughing hard here.. we don't have satellite dishes anymore its all underground!!.. our satellite dishes were fixed in position.. how did they connect to a source moving at 33.000mph.. DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.. DOES IT HA HA HA HA I cant get a signal to an 02 mast close by most days HA HA HA.. I needed a good laugh and here it is.. Thankyou.. have a good day (with your cartoons/CGI)  ""Lets zoom in to a cartoon""  Cant even show the actual thing.. lol"
4543,qs2QcycggWU,Do you have any real pictures of the satellite? not cartoons and CGI stuff? 99% of space stuff is all cartoons and CGI graphics these days... never see any actual footage do we.....
4544,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this while using Starlink 🌏🛰️
4545,qs2QcycggWU,It just keeps track of everyplace you go sometimes you need to be away from it all

4563,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much.
4564,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Mean while I am calling my ISP to check if they have accidently changed some settings thus restricting my internet speed😁
4565,qs2QcycggWU,Hahahahahahahaha
4566,qs2QcycggWU,I thought starlink satellites orbited the earth at the Earth's rotational speed to keep the same position relative to Earth's surface
4567,qs2QcycggWU,This is sooo cool! 😍
4568,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing!!
4569,qs2QcycggWU,So cool. Thanks. I studied some of this in university. My brain jumped the rails when we had to do the beam forming math. Luckily there are bigger brains than mine so someone can do it 🤪
4570,qs2QcycggWU,how does it track so quick?
4571,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow.  More information than I expected, yet there's still no mention of the control hierarchy.  Beautiful graphics.  Cheers."
4572,qs2QcycggWU,Honestly pretty genius to use a Canadian English subtitles to add more detailed notes
4573,qs2QcycggWU,This was the best educational video that I ever saw in my life!
4574,qs2QcycggWU,I have to say the video was unlike anything i watched before thanks a million
4575,qs2QcycggWU,"it's nice they want to stress this is Canadian English. But a lot less ""eh"" and ""buddy""s than I expected."
4576,qs2QcycggWU,just mindblowing tecnology and the explanation using animation were at some next level..... i am in love with this channel now.....🤯🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
4577,qs2QcycggWU,wow
4578,qs2QcycggWU,This is an extraordinary video! It covers all the major domains of electromagnetics and telecommunications.
4579,qs2QcycggWU,💚🤘🏿

4581,qs2QcycggWU,I'm pretty sure that the effort put into creating this video is far more than what 90% of uni professors put into teaching a course in a whole semester.
4582,qs2QcycggWU,i studied electrical engineering but this was the best explanation I ever got
4583,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a great video, the animation is beautiful and it takes into account all the information from the teardowns. I have one picky comment about the switching from TX/RX at 10:58: If you look at the traces on the board, there is only one TRACK feeding each FEM, not a separate RX and TX tracks. I think the switching is a good explanation of that works but one would never put the switch in front of the LNA or after the PA because of degradation of Noise figure and attenuation of transmit power (maybe not that big a deal). Other than that BRAVO!"
4584,qs2QcycggWU,This was incredible😎😬
4585,qs2QcycggWU,Great video explaining thoroughly
4586,qs2QcycggWU,Jesus fucking Christ
4587,qs2QcycggWU,I love this kind of technology. i wish i could work in a place that works with all this stuff
4588,qs2QcycggWU,It was amazingly explained
4589,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for your effort
4590,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video and explanation. Now the only one question is left, is it possible to programmatically change balance of QAM (download/upload phases proportion) in the dishy?"
4591,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing explanation,, 👏 the video is much  beyond other YouTube videos"
4592,qs2QcycggWU,U r amazing! Thanks for the content!
4593,qs2QcycggWU,Question: can this technology replace the cell phone techonology and disrupt companies like verizon/Tmobile etc?
4594,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks you to make this video, I was very fascinated by watching the video. 😇"
4595,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome! As an engineer, I really can appreciate how Branch has simplified such a complex concept. Didn’t  have YouTube introduction during my undergraduate Engineering courses in the late 80’s. I would have done EE instead of MechE"
4596,qs2QcycggWU,Well done man keep it up  we need more Chanel like this one
4597,qs2QcycggWU,Mind-blowing 😍😍😍😍
4598,qs2QcycggWU,If us can sabotage the pipeline so does Russia can shoot down the satellite
4599,qs2QcycggWU,Wow the technological advancement that are now publicly available is beyond comprehension
4600,qs2QcycggWU,This video is a state of art
4601,qs2QcycggWU,Comment
4602,qs2QcycggWU,great video
4603,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible channel. Love the explanations!
4604,qs2QcycggWU,"Congratulations, so impressive subject and video realisation.  

Why a constellation diagram is limited only to 64 combinations? 
Is there a kind of theoretical physical maximum transmission speed limit for this technology ?"
4605,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video.  I was wondering how they were handling the satellite tracking.  I noticed that you didn't touch on the doppler shift of the frequencies involved as the satellite tracks towards and away from Dishy.  Presumably that is managed within the transmit/receive chain.
4606,qs2QcycggWU,yeah this is useful if you're just going on facebook. however if you plan to do any serious gaming with it. forget about it. the latency would be huge. wifi isnt sent at the speed of light. its a radio signal and as such recieving this signal from space and then sending the data back would be an enormous amount of lag between server and client.
4607,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video. Well explained
4608,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, thanks for all the information shared here."
4609,qs2QcycggWU,you also explained how f16 radar works as  bonus
4610,qs2QcycggWU,thanks the concise explanation. didn't realize phased arrays can also be used for internet access. (radars have used this principle for quite a while)
4611,qs2QcycggWU,I mean every physics class needs a projector to show such things
4612,qs2QcycggWU,No Argue. This has to be paid. Too good to be free. Congratulations.
4613,qs2QcycggWU,The presentation was mind blowing
4614,qs2QcycggWU,OMG 🤯 EXCELLENT
4615,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done - good refresher for basic electronics too.
4616,qs2QcycggWU,"LOVE LOVE LOVVVVEEE this ... I HAVE A SCIENCE DEGREE & This SPECIFIC QUESTION has been BOTHERING ME FOR MONTHS. SO GLAD YOU WENT IN DEPTH.  So many YouTubers pander to the technically illiterate, in order to get more views instead of educating . ( Johnny Harris ) . Don't ever shy away from giving correct information because you're afraid people won't understand. That is their issue ."
4617,qs2QcycggWU,I can't describe my words in english. It's just охуеть тут дохуя хуйни придумали
4618,qs2QcycggWU,I knew how a phased array radar worked...today I saw it....too good
4619,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much.
4620,qs2QcycggWU,"Not someone who comments on YouTube but I did want to do it this time. Appreciate the level of effort put into making this. Clear concept explanations, perfect pace and depth for me. This cleared up a lot of things for me. Thank you for making this. Very cool stuff. Subscribed! Please keep making more!"
4621,qs2QcycggWU,Superb  explanation #india
4622,qs2QcycggWU,Wow Elon Musk salute
4623,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome content, thanks for your efforts in that topic."
4624,qs2QcycggWU,great video
4625,qs2QcycggWU,"@Branch Education, what are your educational qualifications? If you want to answer. Wow superb research and content."
4626,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic video and easily understandable by a hobbiest like myself.   I only which you have of portrayed ""broadcast satellite tv"" correctly as geostationary."
4627,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, it was very well made"
4628,qs2QcycggWU,Well presented! Thank you!
4629,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing job
4630,qs2QcycggWU,Lol wtf a video recommending itself to be watched at 1.25 speed and then again at 1.5.
4631,qs2QcycggWU,"that one is some ""flat"" electromagnetic magic
no company was able to achive that, and futhermore.... deliver actual product and profit. As far as i understand, Starlink (actually it is more of Earthlink) is part of Spacex. And yeah, i don't know why, but StarShip is rather MoonShip, or SunShip max.
PS Hey explain h.265 also!!!"
4632,qs2QcycggWU,"I was able to follow along fine on first pass at 2× because of the Iran Air Flight 655 shootdown by the USS Vincennes in 1988. 

In the aftermath, there were _huge_ feature articles in technical publications concerning the AN/SPY-1 phased array radar system and the Aegis Combat System which controlled it. The most convincing version of the story I read at the time was that a misfeature of Aegis was the largest single component of the debacle. 

This is a long while back, but as I recall the story, this was one of the first naval radar systems which automatically linked multiple ships into a combined combat map, when possible. The design problem: before the ships link up, they separately assign numbers to each blip. After they link up, consistent numbers are assigned across the combined map. This forces some blips to suddenly change their assigned number, as perceived by the person at the console on one ship or another. I guess there was supposed to be a way to make the operator aware of these reassignment events, but in this instance it appears that the operator managed to read some parameters from before the number change and some numbers from a different blip after the number change, thinking this was all one aircraft, with the net effect being that a commercial flight that should have been going up was seen as going down, on an apparent attack profile. In addition, they had incorrect information on board about scheduled commercial flights, and a few other factors (as always) that complicated matters, one of which I think involved use of incorrect radio frequencies to contact the aircraft. 

In any case, this particular theory behind the accident drew on incredibly detailed internals of Aegis and the phased array radar system, so everything here was already familiar to me, except for the extreme miniaturization, which is nevertheless mind blowing."
4633,qs2QcycggWU,Very good pace of explaination
4634,qs2QcycggWU,How are multiple starlink dishes not clashing wavelength with each other like if 2 dishes are used side by side
4635,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Good job on the video. You simplified everything superbly. 
4636,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.
4637,qs2QcycggWU,"Gran trabajo,  ojala puedan hacer uno sobre el funcionamiento del sistema de bluetooth"
4638,qs2QcycggWU,the best!
4639,qs2QcycggWU,Very accurate explanation of QAM modulation and RF principles
4640,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you very much for this very detailed and attractively produced video.  It was also interesting (but unfortunately not explained) why the lower modules of the PCB are arranged differently, possibly for alignment purposes?
What could be improved is that the communication between the satellites and the Internet was not properly executed, that would also have been interesting."
4641,qs2QcycggWU,Great thanks for this!!
4642,qs2QcycggWU,Just blown away. Enough said
4643,qs2QcycggWU,Just blown away. Enough said
4644,qs2QcycggWU,"If this would only be true and satellites existed this technology would be really 
amazing."
4645,qs2QcycggWU,👍
4646,qs2QcycggWU,"thank yo for the explanation, you did a wonderful job"
4647,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
4648,qs2QcycggWU,execellent content
4649,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely amazing
4650,qs2QcycggWU,GREAT VIDEO !  VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND .
4651,qs2QcycggWU,No one cares about this crap technology. And who gave Elon musk rights to pollute the space with his thousands of satellites?
4652,qs2QcycggWU,There are better and simpler procedures to achieve electron streaming!!!
4653,qs2QcycggWU,Just wow!
4654,qs2QcycggWU,♥️♥️♥️
4655,qs2QcycggWU,"1) How many dishies can one satellite handle at the same time? 
2) Is the communication to many (or even all) dishies (partly) simultaneous or is it sequentially  interleaved? 
3) Aren't there collisions due to the big transit time and different distances? 
4) Does the satellite keep track of all customer's dishies' positions? 
5) Does the starlink ""feel"" the direction of an additional dishy or is it calculated by it's GPS coordinates?"
4656,qs2QcycggWU,I had some of the same question. I had a question about jamming the satellite or intentional DDOS
4657,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!!!
4658,qs2QcycggWU,Mind successfully blown. Thank you for your time and effort !!
4659,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video thank you!
4660,qs2QcycggWU,Wow .. thanks for your efforts
4661,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing way to explaining and visualizating complex topics like this
4662,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video.Electromagnetic waves are getting too old for communications ( too slow ). same with binary communication, ( serial communication with only 1 or 0 ). Specially for long interplanetary distances is very impractical. Moving electrons is like using a hammer and a nail to communicate. There are better instantaneous ways winning Nobel prices this days."
4663,qs2QcycggWU,Great work
4664,qs2QcycggWU,One of the greatest  video having lot of information
4665,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe this video exists... Very cool!
4666,qs2QcycggWU,They circle above us.
4667,qs2QcycggWU,"Per your request heres my comment. I do value the information, time and resources put into this video.Thank you!
You just got a new subscriber!"
4668,qs2QcycggWU,It was a great video explaining starlink! Thank you
4669,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent video. It has been nice to remember physics that I studied many years ago.
4670,qs2QcycggWU,"What a good job, congratulations, it's an amazing video and magistral/simplified explanations. Im curious if you could do a video explaining how a professional audio mixer works, specially the signal sampling and processing.
It would be very useful.

Thank you."
4671,qs2QcycggWU,I am just amazed by watching your video... Very very good explanation. It can not be explained more clearly than this video... I am just speechless... Excellent Work 
4672,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for such a explanatory video!
4673,qs2QcycggWU,💯💯💯💯
4674,qs2QcycggWU,I wont deal with companies that support Ukraine Nazi.
4675,qs2QcycggWU,"very cool, i learn a lot of things"
4676,qs2QcycggWU,Great
4677,qs2QcycggWU,Really good 😊
4678,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is Mostly Underrated 🤐
4679,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic Video, thank you so much!"
4680,qs2QcycggWU,"How wonderful and complex modern technology is! your afford help us to understand them. Thank  for all, good job."
4681,qs2QcycggWU,There's a lot of incredibly similar comments amazed at this crock of shit.
4682,qs2QcycggWU,Why do you exist
4683,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellite Communications Tech and Network Engineer here.   Your presentation was awesome, BUT,.  Let me add some corrected detail.  The satellite for TV and other ground entry points use a satellite that is locked in a geo-synchronous orbit. Relative to the earth,  the satellite stays in the same place as the earth turns. In the animation, your satellite for the TV was in a retro grade orbit. LOL!!    With that being said,  "" I LOVED YOUR PRESENTATION!!! ""     I really enjoyed how you showed the -/+ charges moving  on the wire in tune with the voltage phase which then gets induced onto the  copper patch.  I wish my Army COBET course had this video back in 1989.   EXCELLENT JOB!!  LOVED IT!   (fix the TV satellite animation 😜)"
4684,qs2QcycggWU,Just Amazing
4685,qs2QcycggWU,How? It is cutting edge! It just takes the money out of your account and puts it into Elon's account.
4686,qs2QcycggWU,Just. Wow.
4687,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely well done! As an electrical and control systems engineer with a strong g interest in physics, I love these explanations of complex topics and, like many of my colleagues who have also noted here, I can see this in my minds eye but I struggle explaining it to others . Well done!!!! This video is a keeper!!! Subscribed!"
4688,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome content! Very thorough!
4689,qs2QcycggWU,Great
4690,qs2QcycggWU,"Not sure why youtube recommend me this but im glad it did , now i ""know"" something i never thought i would even get interested to know , thanks"
4691,qs2QcycggWU,"Take your comment, like and subscription. Wish i could more for such incredible video"
4692,qs2QcycggWU,This ain’t for goofing around with
4693,qs2QcycggWU,Such a great work! Thank you people!!!!
4694,qs2QcycggWU,Send this video  30 years before the engineers will think this antenna chips could be produced in science fiction
4695,qs2QcycggWU,"Real Bussines..
Mengapa aku harus ada di sebuah 
Agenda tanpa di persiapkan dengan baik , aku tidak ingin jika Suport tidak segera di berikan untukku .."
4696,qs2QcycggWU,The engineering behind Starlink is astonishing
4697,qs2QcycggWU,"Microchips & Satelite Operation
OMG.. Shock..."
4698,qs2QcycggWU,shit all this so that I can have slightly faster internet in the country 🤣
4699,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink funding in question: Elon Musk follows "" recommendation"" of Melnyk to ""fuck off"".
Melnyk is still Ukraine's ambassador to Germany. When Elon Musk announced that he could not continue to finance Starlink on his own and demanded support from the Pentagon, he annoyed not only the Pentagon, but also the above-mentioned ambassador, who threw a hearty ""piss off"" at him. That, he said, was ""his diplomatic response"" to Elon Musk's statement. So that's the Ukrainian payoff for making Starlink available, from which the Ukrainian military in particular has benefited. Melnyk is a full-fledged fascist who worships Stepan Bandera, who was a war criminal alongside the German Wehrmacht, particularly the SS Galicia Division. He is glorified as a national hero in Ukraine. But this is nothing new. Melnyk has also called Chancellor Scholz an ""insulted liver sausage"" and in an interview denied the crimes Bandera committed in league with the Nazis. Now the German public broadcasters are weeping after this son of a jackal and almost crying when they stand up and say: ""We will miss you."" ROFL!!"
4700,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool video!
Thank you for it"
4701,qs2QcycggWU,Grasped my attention throughout the entire video. I have no prior knowledge on all this stuff but I'm always seeking to learn new information. It's pretty amazing on how advanced satellite technology is. Thank you for this. Keep it coming!
4702,qs2QcycggWU,WTF has DIRECTV being doing the last 30years besides charge too damn much
4703,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
4704,qs2QcycggWU,"wow, fantastic"
4705,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible
4706,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, but How Cellular Work like 4G?"
4707,qs2QcycggWU,"Very well presented, excellent visuals and simplified explaination making the subject easier to understand."
4708,qs2QcycggWU,"Such a good representation, thanks a lot."
4709,qs2QcycggWU,"I can't wait till one satellite gets crashed and then 4 and 8 16 32 
Haaahhhaaaa 
Freaking morons.
What gives anybody the right to do these things.
And you cry about global warming yet this bullshit is all good right."
4710,qs2QcycggWU,This is the dumbest idea ever proposed.
4711,qs2QcycggWU,Very good!
4712,qs2QcycggWU,"Where does one get a Dishy PCB?  Are they commercially available, or are they proprietary?  Who makes them?"
4713,qs2QcycggWU,How does this video only have 1.2mil views?? I'm mindblown by the information and researche! Kudos!
4714,qs2QcycggWU,My brain is currently overheating!🤯
4715,qs2QcycggWU,"WTF did I just watch? How human can possible understand this science is so fascinating, let alone using that understanding to create a technology. At first I thought I saw future warp drive engine video :O"
4716,qs2QcycggWU,wow - its great😀
4717,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind Blowing, Amazing, Awesome, Cool and Great. 😍😍😍"
4718,qs2QcycggWU,well done!  makes GPS look like 2 tin cans and a string!
4719,qs2QcycggWU,Wait till you see the two pieces of wire some county connect to that antenna
4720,qs2QcycggWU,"thanks for so great videos, btw, how to makes those animation？"
4721,qs2QcycggWU,wow. outstanding video production. visuals perfect to help explain. keep it up
4722,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video.  I just discovered your company and will definitely explore and share.  Very impressive.
4723,qs2QcycggWU,It's fascinating how easy is to understand such a complicated stuffs with a good video.  Thanks 👍
4724,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown. This is the stuff u can create when gathering the world's best and brightest under one roof. An American melting pot of ingenuity
4725,qs2QcycggWU,Very comprehensive content! The video composition is intricate. Been a subscriber of Kurzgesagt for years and so happy to find a channel like it!
4726,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow
Amazing video 👌"
4727,qs2QcycggWU,A comment bellow.
4728,qs2QcycggWU,"Now review the numerous ground stations which host the respective satellites in view, that service the internet path from satellite to ground.  The waiting period to get your Starlink is some of the stations build out density isn't enough yet to facilitate you. While physically built, the electronics capacities aren't installed as yet. But will be, thus opening the slots necessary for your home system.

Etc etc"
4729,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, animation for explaining such of complexity, just wow. Awesome video and informations!"
4730,qs2QcycggWU,It's incredibly brilliant teaching material.I'll waitng for nexts to come
4731,qs2QcycggWU,"15:12 math is scary and i cannot do it.
15:22  learn calculus like me :D"
4732,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
4733,qs2QcycggWU,16:16 Elon is from other planet.
4734,qs2QcycggWU,I am actually USING this system & find it just as easily stopped by clouds & weather conditions as ground based WIFI transmitters.  Wish I could use what China has developed.
4735,qs2QcycggWU,i should have known this channel existed....awesome work and best regards to the creators.
4736,qs2QcycggWU,And when did we all vote or have a say in any of  all this??
4737,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing! Thank you so much!
4738,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
4739,qs2QcycggWU,Please explain starlink satellite and tell how many antennas it can handle at a time?
4740,qs2QcycggWU,This is crazy to think people had to think about it and understand every single bit of what they are doing to make all of this working
4741,qs2QcycggWU,"congratz, great explanation!!"
4742,qs2QcycggWU,Hahahaha good story bro.
4743,qs2QcycggWU,What is the need of this complex technology at a large scale?? Well it would be very much expensive.
4744,qs2QcycggWU,can Starlink dish be installed over the sailboat during sailing across the open ocean??
4745,qs2QcycggWU,SubhanAllaah
4746,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent!!
4747,qs2QcycggWU,"So many comments of people being amazed but sadly, because so much BS & lies started this I hardly could write as I know I wouldn’t finish watching! Dishy flat face 😂, well that information may be true abt the dish but the satellite part is straight lies as there are no satellites floating in space “& they know it”! They do get the signals from electro magnetic pulses but it’s how they get it is the trick, quite complex as they found out way back that the higher altitude bounces back the signals sent so they have a dish to send & one to receive! I hope the don’t band me 😂…it’s a deeper mystery as to how though but do some research & don’t just take the regular narrative, think & view alternatively."
4748,qs2QcycggWU,Mate hate to burst your bubble but 30rs ham radio operator and also satellite coms work your completely wrong
4749,qs2QcycggWU,"Great effort! extremely informative and well presented, thanks so much 🙏"
4750,qs2QcycggWU,"amazing, ty"
4751,qs2QcycggWU,Shoot them all down. More space junk to deal with
4752,qs2QcycggWU,"I studied electrical engineering, and this is the best explanation of many of the complex topics I had to study I’ve ever seen. This is where the promise of internet is actually a good thing."
4753,qs2QcycggWU,Electrical or electronic?
4754,qs2QcycggWU,"@@imho2278 Electrical, of which electronic is a subset. Why?"
4755,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing stuff guys, well done!"
4756,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the quality content!
4757,qs2QcycggWU,I just see now. I always use internet  everyday in Cambodia. Thank you for sharing this video.
4758,qs2QcycggWU,"It's a mind blowing work. I can't understanding that how I appreciate and support you all, bcos I have not enough money to donate u. Just, GOD bless u all. Thank you...😊😊"
4759,qs2QcycggWU,"What an amazing transformation I have been privileged to see in my lifetime. From sitting in our bedroom with my brother, struggling to get a clear signal on our crystal radio set, to installing Dishy McFlatface on my caravan! What a ride! And thanks to sites like this, for giving me an understanding of this wild new world!"
4760,qs2QcycggWU,"Even though I don't understand all, I do admire your hard work!"
4761,qs2QcycggWU,nice
4762,qs2QcycggWU,I'm amazed at just how intelligent some people are. This is incredible technology
4763,qs2QcycggWU,"Reading science at the idea level it seems the community is missing the laws and sciences of complexity, scaling, intelligence and isomorphism. Maybe more. Complexity is touched upon by Parisi/Charboneau; Intelligence by the artificial intelligence and robotics communities; Scaling touched upon by Miodownick ""Stuff Matters"" and others and Isomorphism by Demi Hassabis. Having said that, a smartphone engineer may help to make these sciences. Complexity to me is illustrated by chess game, and the periodic table as a game. Compare chess and periodic table in terms of complexity. Need a measure of complexity that applies to all. Like BIPM."
4764,qs2QcycggWU,Just what I was looking for!  Keep up the good work!
4765,qs2QcycggWU,This was an awesome explanation!
4766,qs2QcycggWU,"My goodness this was actually way more info then I expected, thanks guys! Exactly what I wanted to know! like a visual and explanation that makes sense and furthers my understanding wow."
4767,qs2QcycggWU,"would u also do a video about block chain, please❤"
4768,qs2QcycggWU,I love this channel❤i just feel bad why i didn’t find it sooner
4769,qs2QcycggWU,Can this work in something that is moving? like a sailboat or a van?
4770,qs2QcycggWU,all of the world now are depends on  this  techniques  starlink satellite internet  because of it's consider the basic of all the informations to starting in any science projects  ...
4771,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
4772,qs2QcycggWU,Best video on YouTube!!!! It can't be free!
4773,qs2QcycggWU,how can over than 2300 satellites cant get crashed into each other in speed of 27k km per hour!
4774,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine 2300 tables equally spaced and placed anywhere across the land and sea.  Then vary their altitude by about 1km and they can just float in the air.
4775,qs2QcycggWU,"what u present a critical marvel piece of engineering....which turns our head....right now i am thinking the complexity of the satelite receiver module....must be more more complex than this....cause it is receiving and sending 100 or 1000 dishes data by a single (or 4 maybe) antenna each every second....btw want to know is it suitable in all weather condition like heavy rain disrupt tv signals...one more thing why elon musk build this...in today we are receiving speedy data (like me..in a village of third world country India,getting 750 mbps BB speed @ 20 USd\mnth) most of the populated area(not earth surface area %) rest of the people exclude this area neither big volume subscriber nor they dont need data (farmer etc) and if needed ground based tower or fibre cable can increase the radius..... my point is how this will be economical (basically ROI)  and how much mass  selling will  be that volume turns profit to mr mars..... he must have some other vision...plz make ur opinion"
4776,qs2QcycggWU,Really good video.....👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
4777,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing explanation
4778,qs2QcycggWU,The uplink speed isn't always able to be the same as downlink speed in the real world.
4779,qs2QcycggWU,Lost me at magically.
4780,qs2QcycggWU,"I read Rigden ""Hydrogen"" and current papers to address one question. Are atoms elemental quantum computers? I stopped reading when a peer reviewed paper addressed memory at near atomic scale. Not sure if you guys have given it a thought. Your Starlink video shows how far we've come since Canada's Alouette, first commercial satellite in orbit, circa 1962. Way over my head."
4781,qs2QcycggWU,amazing
4782,qs2QcycggWU,"this content is that good, there was no need to ask us to subscribe, i did it right when you said how the antenna angles. this is great!"
4783,qs2QcycggWU,👍
4784,qs2QcycggWU,They should set this up so the resistance in Iran can communicate with each other now that the government shut down the internet there !
4785,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool.
4786,qs2QcycggWU,The animation is outstanding!
4787,qs2QcycggWU,Too cool!
4788,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for the enlightening video.
 Keep up the good work."
4789,qs2QcycggWU,Love it.
4790,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. Maybe one of the best 'how it works' videos I've ever seen!
4791,qs2QcycggWU,How comes the satellites 🛰 don't crash
4792,qs2QcycggWU,very nice and cool animations
4793,qs2QcycggWU,Simply You Guys Are Guinness.
4794,qs2QcycggWU,🤔🤯🤯
4795,qs2QcycggWU,a way amazing video
4796,qs2QcycggWU,uff
4797,qs2QcycggWU,best learning
4798,qs2QcycggWU,Expensive and  not efficient of starlink internet 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4799,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! I was just amazed of this content, very educational.. 👍👍👍"
4800,qs2QcycggWU,Why wouldn't these work in a synchronous orbit above ?if your putting tons of them up why not just adjust them stationary?
4801,qs2QcycggWU,stuff's so good you're gonna make me binge watch again😭
4802,qs2QcycggWU,Great stuff you got my first YouTube comment ever!
4803,qs2QcycggWU,Wow I just started studying electrical engineering and I love there is a channel that goes into detail and really explains technology and also modern technology like this for instance!
4804,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! The quality and details of this video is mind blowing 😮 Thank you!
4805,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!!!! what wonder full explanation reminds me of university subjects where we learn amplitude and modulation.
4806,qs2QcycggWU,"The short answer is: IT DOESN'T.   I RARELY get over 30mbps, and most of the time avg 8mbps."
4807,qs2QcycggWU,Sweet baby Jesus
4808,qs2QcycggWU,All devils demonic lies plans deeds attacks weapons desires crimes against God be failed stopped punished destroyed in the name of Jesus Christ!
4809,qs2QcycggWU,Did a excellent job it was very informative there was a couple of times it was so in depth I was getting frustrated I was going can we shorten this and get to the point without all the complexity so good job but know you might have went a little over the top with some things I did care to know I was like I just want to know how the beam points but some of the other info is getting frustrating and annoying and to complex
4810,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for creating
4811,qs2QcycggWU,loved the video !! Amazing  piece of Engineering
4812,qs2QcycggWU,"teknologi yang sangat luar biasa, terimakasih sudah menjelaskannya kepada kami"
4813,qs2QcycggWU,"I understood every concept of this mind - blowing project.

I would like to say, It is amazing 😀 and world going to be changed 🎉."
4814,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the fantastic video and scientific description. is the land dish place detectable via its canseling emotions by specific terrestrial devices? and if the answer is yes what can be done to avoid the detection of the land dish coordination?
4815,qs2QcycggWU,This will kill birds.🙈
4816,qs2QcycggWU,The birds and the bees
4817,qs2QcycggWU,"Can only hope the Chinese can find out about Tiananmen Square. Islam  girls can get an education, NOK people will riot..Dictators can't operate..Then we will have world peace."
4818,qs2QcycggWU,So many processes happening within milliseconds are marvellous.
4819,qs2QcycggWU,This is why elon musk is an allien :p
4820,qs2QcycggWU,"So, It includes all kinds engineering"
4821,qs2QcycggWU,"Great work sir, guys and gals.  Please do more.  Tap on visa machines or uummm... rockets or space equipment. Stuff like that. :)"
4822,qs2QcycggWU,It works as long as you don't insult or threaten Elon Musk.
4823,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting to look. It is a lot of information though squeezed into 28 minutes. I would also enjoy the long version at lower talk pace 🙂 I will watch this one once again and going to dig more about this type of antenna's and modulation..
4824,qs2QcycggWU,Cool channel.
4825,qs2QcycggWU,"At the point when starlink satellite grid around the Earth is complete .........what's the odds of a rocket going into space ,HITTING A STARLINK SATELLITE ❓"
4826,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you..! Thanks a lot... It really mesmerised me to realise that how much human brilliance has gone far and how smart & intelligent we become... 💝❤️
4827,qs2QcycggWU,"The sats are NOT 550 Km outside the atmosphere....In addition, TV sats are not moving around the earth as displayed."
4828,qs2QcycggWU,physics is amazing   changing electric field produces magnetic field and thus emw propagates in perpendicular direction
4829,qs2QcycggWU,"I fear that the videos will cost in the future, cause its soo good!!"
4830,qs2QcycggWU,I’m curious if these circuits are designed by AI?
4831,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks that answers a lot.. I didnt find that too much or too complicated ( just the right level of tech).
4832,qs2QcycggWU,Support
4833,qs2QcycggWU,Sounds like Casey Casem is explaining Starlink.  Love it! Excellent narration.
4834,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best videos I have ever seen..thank you so much
4835,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks for this beautiful video, technical at the right point and not boring at all.
Keep up the great work"
4836,qs2QcycggWU,"Phased array beam forming is black magic.  Being involved with 5G ORAN and 5G core testing, the complexity of this system is mind blowing, to the point that it’s mind blowing that everything works in the first place.  And phased array beam forming is a small but critical piece of the pie in the gNode B (5G radios), and the gNode B is a small but important piece of the pie of an ORAN network (gNB + O-DU + O-CU elements), of which the ORAN network is a small but important piece of the pie to the 5G core, and the many elements that make up the 5G core (ie AMF + SMF + UPF + all the other network services like the NRF + AUSF + PCRF….and on and on and on) are themselves small but important piece of the pie that makes up the entire 5G ecosystem….

AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CARRY THIS TECH AROUND WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY!

Mind blowing!  Who in their right mind comes up with this stuff???"
4837,qs2QcycggWU,လုံးဝ မိုက်တယ်
4838,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm a medical doctor, so far from engineering field. But, I can easily understand the topic by your teaching. I say 'teaching'. Because, this video made me understand more with what I've learnt and never known. Thanks alot. In reward, I've subscribed, liked and commented."
4839,qs2QcycggWU,"Super cool vedio! Thx a lot.
Could you share any literature about patch antenna design and fabrication if there is?"
4840,qs2QcycggWU,It's a wonderful video.  Very informative.
4841,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting technology
4842,qs2QcycggWU,Great work
4843,qs2QcycggWU,24 and 2 fireworks! :)
4844,qs2QcycggWU,For your efforts.. Thumbs up
4845,qs2QcycggWU,What A great research .. Excellent work.. keep it up. God Bless you.
4846,qs2QcycggWU,Very clear and easy to understand. I’m curious to know what software you use for animation and modeling. Are you hiring. =]
4847,qs2QcycggWU,A wonderful perfection-approaching sci-tech video
4848,qs2QcycggWU,Wat the hell is 1x speed then?? Grandpa speed?
4849,qs2QcycggWU,"And then, we sprinkled some magic dust 💨💨🕶️❇️💨💨 !!!
Seriously though, thank you for sharing this 👍🇺🇸 It's amazing technology, but it's always been there just waiting to be discovered ! What I learned was how much you can stuff into 1 second of time 🤯 I mean, a picosecond. (One trillionth of a second)!!!!!!!!!!! 🤯"
4850,qs2QcycggWU,brilliant
4851,qs2QcycggWU,I saw 1 pizza... sausage with xx cheese my favorite!!!
4852,qs2QcycggWU,i like new start
4853,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
4854,qs2QcycggWU,"This is precisely the education I want on the daily basis, this channel will never get old for me"
4855,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing
4856,qs2QcycggWU,"mind blown. subscribed, liked and commented. just following the rules :))! thank you."
4857,qs2QcycggWU,around 12:35 you describe that starlinks send to multiple dishy's; how are they addressed? in phasing or some type of tcp/ip scheme?
4858,qs2QcycggWU,Comment added
4859,qs2QcycggWU,mindblowed^100
4860,qs2QcycggWU,absolutely underrated content! Tanks for creating this video
4861,qs2QcycggWU,Pefect :)
4862,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best explanation of how SL works that I have seen. Thanks!
4863,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent!!
4864,qs2QcycggWU,Love Starlink! Saved my job working at High elevation. Can game no problem
4865,qs2QcycggWU,exceptional video - can't believe that i am watching it for free...
4866,qs2QcycggWU,excellent work
4867,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video
4868,qs2QcycggWU,"Does it imply that the dishes must be stationary? How could it work on a moving vehicle, or boat?"
4869,qs2QcycggWU,"I used to feel the physics classes sort of boring in school days. But after watching these videos, I can understand what amazing processes those concepts can help with!"
4870,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink有相控天線技術
4871,qs2QcycggWU,"No regrets going with Starlink so far, Xplornet was a joke and the only option I had was Starlink, 150-200mbps"
4872,qs2QcycggWU,I Love it
4873,qs2QcycggWU,ʕ⁠っ⁠•⁠ᴥ⁠•⁠ʔ⁠っ
4874,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you Elon musk!!!!!
4875,qs2QcycggWU,dimag ka dahi kar diya...Man You are on Next level.
4876,qs2QcycggWU,"Wowwwwwww, this is the Most Incredible Video I have ever come across, there's no other way to describe it than BRILLIANT!!. The intelligence of Engineers to create this Amazing State of Arts Technology is so Superb. The video showcase me that there's so much more I don't know, and I would really love to know so am going to try some courses on Brilliant right away. But I can't fail to take a pause and appreciate all the Great work you guys put together to make this Video, one of the key points I enjoyed about it was the intro, in play and outro music/tone/ epic sound that's being used has a backing track to the narrators voice, has a sound Engineer myself I love the compressor and reverb effects they applied to the narrators voice. And the way they explained the Analogy behind the technology is on point, with all the extra information and hints found in the Canadian subtitles. Is so Fantastic. I wish I could donate to your company to support your Great work because I know that you deserve it and more. More Grace Branch Education. I have been really Blessed by your Videos. (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤"
4877,qs2QcycggWU,"Great content and explanation, the animation made it easier to understand. It is well explained. You guys really put a hard work on research, I admire you for that. Huuugeee respect. Thank you for giving us this kind of content!"
4878,qs2QcycggWU,Great work & explanation
4879,qs2QcycggWU,How much different is this from an PESA radar ?
4880,qs2QcycggWU,You earned it
4881,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent work in explaining complex electrical operations.
4882,qs2QcycggWU,great vid
4883,qs2QcycggWU,So amazing work .. I wish you do more work like that.
4884,qs2QcycggWU,Complex integration of physics and electrical/electronic engineering principles for a single device functionality.  This is awesome achievement.
4885,qs2QcycggWU,Very great
4886,qs2QcycggWU,Dont know payed for it and never got it.
4887,qs2QcycggWU,🤯
4888,qs2QcycggWU,A most awesome explanation of how the starlink signal transmissions work!😊
4889,qs2QcycggWU,"My God! How come with all these science, human still die from Cancer and other stupid diseases."
4890,qs2QcycggWU,So what is next? Machine learning that makes models all the time to predict what a client wants and grab it from an outer-space data-center where we store a huge cache?  Just to relief the ground stations...?
4891,qs2QcycggWU,"Made me remind college. 
Thank you very much. Very interesting 👌🏽"
4892,qs2QcycggWU,"21:46 The KA link to the gateway uses two gimbaled parabolic antennas that's aren't depicted on your graphic of the satellite. The four ESA's are for user terminal KU spot beams, one for uplink and 3 for downlink. 👍"
4893,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, I was curious about that."
4894,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome!
4895,qs2QcycggWU,this technology will be obsolete in 10 years.. The advancement in discovery in technology and the application of physics and math is compounding and accelerating. The more discovery and development happens the faster technology evolves.
4896,qs2QcycggWU,"there is two mode of phase shift in signals, one for 6bit modulation and the other for beam direction. how manage them?"
4897,qs2QcycggWU,"Good Job, it is one of the best tutorial video ever seen."
4898,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for explaining
4899,qs2QcycggWU,What about risk losing net during war
4900,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting vidoe
4901,qs2QcycggWU,Owesome animation .I learnt a lot through this.thanks for all you smart people balance  our life.😊
4902,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video. I watch the video at 2x speed and while eating, but I wish I can watch this as at 3x speed. I had to hit the fast-forward when i see some background info being explained. Props to whoever came up with this invention. :)"
4903,qs2QcycggWU,Loved it.
4904,qs2QcycggWU,"Wao, great work, will like to see more about video compresion and  how to creat bits bu changing amplitud and phase"
4905,qs2QcycggWU,"Is ""Mr. McFlatface"" his real name?"
4906,qs2QcycggWU,I had my mouth open throughout the whole video. The explanation and visualization are extremely well done. Bravo!
4907,qs2QcycggWU,Is this the same technology use in fighter 🛩 jet
4908,qs2QcycggWU,Love it 😍
4909,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video
4910,qs2QcycggWU,"thus that will be like a monopoly in wifi system, and abd starlink will have all the flux of data traveling on internet that she will use for it own purposes"
4911,qs2QcycggWU,Hard to believe Starlink got permission for so many satellites swarming around.
4912,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of animation is astonishing
4913,qs2QcycggWU,Had our Starlink head north during hurricane Ian.  And absolutely NO response from Starlink about replacing it.  They're are neck-and-neck  with DirecTV in the bad service olympics .
4914,qs2QcycggWU,Same as google’s project loon.  Balloons
4915,qs2QcycggWU,Thank u so much for this explication
4916,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question,we use phase relationship of units to change the direction,but we also use phase in QAM,so how does it works together? If we use QAM how do we control the direction at the same time?😂"
4917,qs2QcycggWU,"""How does it work?""
A: badly! ... far slower despite having THOUSANDS MORE satelites WAY closer to earth (compared to other providers*). That's an achievement.
Instead of hiring 3 professionals they went with a kindergarden full toddlers. That's starlink for you. Another cheap failure branded as 'success'
ps and IF you are a musk fan and think thats oppinion, well, I AM NOT the one who just lost a *900 million* boost due to lacking performance..."
4918,qs2QcycggWU,Was is too expensive to create a dish that receives and transmits data at the same time? Or it is not technically possible? Also i thought the satellites are geostatic so no need to follow them with the beam
4919,qs2QcycggWU,"... 10,000 more garbage cans in space 👏  ...."
4920,qs2QcycggWU,"thank you very much，it’s a fantastic video for student to look into the technology,waiting for more good videos!❤❤❤"
4921,qs2QcycggWU,"I find it hard to believe one can see, with a naked eye, a 7m long satellite from a distance of 550kms."
4922,qs2QcycggWU,incredible instructive video I have ever seen❤
4923,qs2QcycggWU,Me Asian watching at  0.75x speed.
4924,qs2QcycggWU,mind blown!!!
4925,qs2QcycggWU,"I am impressed with this video, both intuitive and quality wise. I subscribed immediately, well done!"
4926,qs2QcycggWU,"Allright. I understood all this. However. How does the starlink satellite send different data to so many dishy-s? 
And secondly… what’s the health hazards being in range of constant satellite beam bombardment?"
4927,qs2QcycggWU,so satisfying
4928,qs2QcycggWU,Another INCREDIBLE VIDEO
4929,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question about phase shifting. It is explained that phase shifts are used for angling the beam, but phase shifting is also used as a symbol for data transmission. So what if the phase shift required for angling the beam and transmitting data is different? I think I'm missing something here. 
The reasonable explanation I could come up with is that the starlink satellite have a standard phase and it will compare the standard phase with the incoming electromagnetic phase"
4930,qs2QcycggWU,"As good as the video was, it raised more questions than it answered. Not a bad thing."
4931,qs2QcycggWU,Hats off to your hard work. 💖
4932,qs2QcycggWU,Five star to the knowledge shared
4933,qs2QcycggWU,"So 10,000+ Starlink satellites will be orbiting the Earth at 27,000 kph 550 km up?"
4934,qs2QcycggWU,thank for this video
4935,qs2QcycggWU,This video is more amazing than starlink itself. Congrats.... Keep going
4936,qs2QcycggWU,"10,000 starlink satellites in the sky is revolting, nauseating, but a buck is a buck"
4937,qs2QcycggWU,🤯🤯🤯
4938,qs2QcycggWU,What is the difference between starlink and Starlink 2.0?
4939,qs2QcycggWU,"😮, this is incredible."
4940,qs2QcycggWU,"subscribe to support your work. thanks, one your video is post it notify me to watch."
4941,qs2QcycggWU,Great explaination and cool animation
4942,qs2QcycggWU,A video on how the satellite can potentially stay connected (transmit and receive) to 100’s if not thousands dishy simultaneously would be awesome!!!
4943,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much for all the hard work. This is real quality material
4944,qs2QcycggWU,They should do Starlink Sim Card for Mobile .
4945,qs2QcycggWU,@Branch Education Great video.really appreciate the effort for creating such a comprehensive explanation. Can you please refer me to a book or article which goes through the math and physics behind the reason why combined power is 3500 times greater than that of single antenna instead of 1800 ?
4946,qs2QcycggWU,"This video was as awsome as God Level Brilliance!
Literally Mind Blowing!"
4947,qs2QcycggWU,good
4948,qs2QcycggWU,09:23 Fleming's Right hand rule
4949,qs2QcycggWU,"Changing the phase to steer the beam kind of reminds me of the way a wagon wheel appears to spin backwards on film.  Its about timing.    Not real science i know, but just a thought."
4950,qs2QcycggWU,wow so cool one person can ruin the sky for the rest of the world
4951,qs2QcycggWU,Fajny materiał
4952,qs2QcycggWU,I made an attempt to get Starlink. Their customer service sucks. They told me I am not in their service area. Strange. I thought Starlink was designed to provide people living in rural areas to obtain high speed internet?
4953,qs2QcycggWU,lies! truth is out give it up
4954,qs2QcycggWU,Love this channel
4955,qs2QcycggWU,I love this video.
4956,qs2QcycggWU,KICK ASS!!!
4957,qs2QcycggWU,"amazing video, amazing channel!"
4958,qs2QcycggWU,Explanation at its best! ✌🏻
4959,qs2QcycggWU,I am not an electrical engineer but is stayed at a holiday inn last night... so I understand all that's being  said.
4960,qs2QcycggWU,what we are?
4961,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink works like this.... First you use your company to get government contracts under false pretenses like.... Bringing reliable internet to rural areas.....  THEN you sell your soul to the Military and offer early access to ""customers"" in said rural areas.... take their preorder money.... use that to buy stocks.. and then not ship said ""dishies"" to the early rural customers but instead offer higher paying customers a cut in the line for roaming dishes in populated urban areas while also allowing said wealthier higher paying customers to move their ""roaming"" services into their country homes in areas where you deny the early access poor customers sending out emails saying... your area isfull and then tell the poor people who paid early tehy are being charged more on their prepayment.... use that to buy more stocks while never intending to deliver.... wait for inflation to increase and tehn offer them inferior ""emergency"" service with severly throttled service..{because you have a behind the closed door agrreement with hughsnet to transfer said poors over to their inferior satellites for a cut of the fee} and then encourage refunds.... after inflation has reduced the value of the preorder fees,,,,, PROFIT ATTAINED!!!"
4962,qs2QcycggWU,❤️
4963,qs2QcycggWU,like subscribe and share is very less for this video.. salute you guys..
4964,qs2QcycggWU,Are Starlink satellite dishes traceable by governments?
4965,qs2QcycggWU,"And fuck astronomy right, isn't there anything this filthy capitalist class isn't willing to destroy for profit?"
4966,qs2QcycggWU,This is insanely great explanation! Wonderful work!!! I love understanding complex projects suck as Starlink. Thank you !!!
4967,qs2QcycggWU,good work
4968,qs2QcycggWU,"Imagine if our schools used this type of educational tooling for subject mater.... instead of worrying about pronouns and what bathroom to use?

Can you imagine the untapped human potential being wasted daily?"
4969,qs2QcycggWU,"Thats awesome, but as you said, initially it was 45 mins long, it would've been better if you guys made part 1 and 2."
4970,qs2QcycggWU,"12ghz? Damn, I dont know how we arent all getting sick or dying. LOL"
4971,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
4972,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video. Kudos
4973,qs2QcycggWU,This voice!
4974,qs2QcycggWU,The mind blowing 😌💯
4975,qs2QcycggWU,Nice vidéo
4976,qs2QcycggWU,"25 shooting stars
{:-) PAV UK"
4977,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm using Starlink to watch this video and respond (obviously).  But what I find mind blowing is how simple the setup is, as compared to the complicated technology.
The setup is so simple, I spent 10 minutes looking for further instructions, thinking ""It can't be this easy"".
Mind blowing.  But not cheap lol."
4978,qs2QcycggWU,this video is amazing  thank you so much
4979,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
4980,qs2QcycggWU,That is just unbelievable.
4981,qs2QcycggWU,Erm switching every 15-20seconds not 4mins
4982,qs2QcycggWU,Guys i have starlink and i get under 1mbps when it rains. Its shit
4983,qs2QcycggWU,Doesn't lower orbit satellite are bad for high radiation.
4984,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, this video is awesome !!! It shows how much processing power your brain as used to visualise these things and explain the same.."
4985,qs2QcycggWU,How does Doppler affect the system? The satellites are moving much faster than the ground terminal…
4986,qs2QcycggWU,Blown 😂
4987,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the very informative video and animation♥

4989,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for putting it all together. Appreciated 🙏
4990,qs2QcycggWU,Perfect presentation and material tremendously. Enjoyed the topic and please continue the great work.
4991,qs2QcycggWU,"Watch three times and make note on canadian subtitles but yet not understand, fuckin complicated too many  scientific turm."
4992,qs2QcycggWU,"Impressive presentation. Some of the ideas, like smart antenna system with beam forming and steering, massive MIMO antenna system, operating at mmWave range, and handover management in a high mobility environment, ... whose implementetions were delayed for territorial use are now made possible here. What a great achievement. I wish the next presentation will focus on the network aspect of STARLINK than the device or components aspect which is covered here."
4993,qs2QcycggWU,Love the physics and how chips and fragments of copper form the beam. Would like more about the network too.
4994,qs2QcycggWU,👍👍👍👍
4995,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant! Work 
Thank you 
Very well animated and explained 
And of course, attractive narration!❤"
4996,qs2QcycggWU,wow.. super cool...
4997,qs2QcycggWU,It was a perfect explanation of how it works! Right to the point and well-focused so more people can understand the concepts! Thank you for making it happen!
4998,qs2QcycggWU,yes it is perfect system.
4999,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
5000,qs2QcycggWU,"Lmao - fake AF.
They said it was all sattelites years ago and turned out to be underground cables and phone towers lol"
5001,qs2QcycggWU,Just Insane my mind just blown away 😵

5008,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice video!
5009,qs2QcycggWU,"Stop lying. We all use underwater cable for internet. There is no star link. There is   no use of satellites to justify alledged money spent on them. There is no moonlanding, there is no space ... The Earth is Flat."
5010,qs2QcycggWU,indeed your work is head and shoulders above other channels in this matter.
5011,qs2QcycggWU,Minute @24:00 has better explanations than a semester in a college combined... Mindblowing

5018,qs2QcycggWU,wow
5019,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn I'm amazed of how much advanced and complex all of this. Youre videos really open my eyes as to how we consumers of these brilliant technologies can't even begin to comprehend these amazing concepts,  while there are scientists and engineering working hard behind the scenes. And I really like and appreciate your animated videos, please continue making videos about these astonishing technologies and engineering."
5020,qs2QcycggWU,"Absolutely enjoyed watching it as an IC designer. Beautiful engineering, amazing explanations!!!"

5035,qs2QcycggWU,Excellenr
5036,qs2QcycggWU,best video on the subject I see  now
5037,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice job DONE in detail....
5038,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm amazed how you managed to fit such a complex topic in under half an hour, while still explaining everything proper."
5039,qs2QcycggWU,NEXT: a video explaining how a regular cellphone is able to reach a satellite?
5040,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing complexity !
5041,qs2QcycggWU,"First part of the video: Science is fun
The rest of the video: Actually doing science"
5042,qs2QcycggWU,So good explanation!! Thank you!!
5043,qs2QcycggWU,I love the video 📹 😍
5044,qs2QcycggWU,"This is one of the most well produces YouTube video I ever saw, amazing! Thank you very much for your work."
5045,qs2QcycggWU,This video basically tells you what is an Antennae and how it works. ThankYou.
5046,qs2QcycggWU,it's very interesting especially now am doing radio frequency's and radiation in telecommunication
5047,qs2QcycggWU,this is brilliant man......we think its easy but the complexity in it is
5048,qs2QcycggWU,"some of the satellites were destroyed with a sun burst. hopefully they can be replaced and continue to install over 4,000 satellites +"
5049,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the detailed narrative. complexity made easier.  The speeds are 10 times faster than fiber optics.  The military should be able to use for the hypersonic items.
5050,qs2QcycggWU,As  a satellite engineer a greatly appreciate this video.
5051,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much! Excellent video!
5052,qs2QcycggWU,"After watching this video i really believe that Starlink satellite internet is WAY TO CHEAP!
I mean, the whole development team (software + hardware) CAN'T BE PAID ENOGHT to achive that. 
Just thinking about how boring vectors are to study makes me give all the respect to those engenieers"
5053,qs2QcycggWU,How do people even came up with this. That’s so amazing!
5054,qs2QcycggWU,I love your work
5055,qs2QcycggWU,"- то ти је дечко радарска технологија са војних авиона на тој антени

5056,qs2QcycggWU,Isn't the up-link energy required totally energy insufficient at this distance? A narrow field of beam forming/ overlapping frequencies while most of the total energy output is lost.
5057,qs2QcycggWU,Hows it going to work? Well it's going to work hand in hand with neurolink or your smart chip that will be installed in your body. It will track every human on the planet that has taken this chip.
5058,qs2QcycggWU,wonderful amazing superb...very interesting and beautifully explained with a lot of effort have been put into this video. ❤❤⭐✌
5059,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome! Thanks!
5060,qs2QcycggWU,Great 👍
5061,qs2QcycggWU,"Plz make video on computer science, programming, artificial intelligence"
5062,qs2QcycggWU,what a magnificent level of animation😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
5063,qs2QcycggWU,I have never seen such a video with this kind of explanation 
5064,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for your efforts
5065,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome...
5066,qs2QcycggWU,"I dont know when my neurons and synapse will be able to recover from these madness. zfrom now on I will only watch kardashians( lol, such is where the society today) Thank you for the video and already subscribe and more power to you!"
5067,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible
5068,qs2QcycggWU,Wow.  I did my MS in optics. This was fantastic.
5069,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks
5070,qs2QcycggWU,This is such an interesting video. I'm also watching this on Starlink!
5071,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive. Both the video and the engineering behind the starlink system. But I really thought that the bitmap at 25:42 would be an image of the kids' missing sister.
5072,qs2QcycggWU,In cloudy weather !
5073,qs2QcycggWU,V sat is already in india doing the same .
5074,qs2QcycggWU,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
5075,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome! I didn't know that such a complex concept can be explained in such a simple manner. Being an engineer myself, i feel our education system is what is needing a revolution now!"
5076,qs2QcycggWU,you're the first youtube I've seen who recommends watching at higher playback speed which I think is pretty funny because the pace isn't that bad or anything
5077,qs2QcycggWU,"As a physicist, i was expecting something more in depth, but nevertheless it is a great basics of wave dynamics."
5078,qs2QcycggWU,This is SKYNET!!!
5079,qs2QcycggWU,"Congrats! This is the type of content that makes YouTube, the Internet, and in general, the world a better place."
5080,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for a great crash course!
5081,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown 🤯🤯🤯
5082,qs2QcycggWU,I was wondering how the thing worked and this is enough for me to feel satisfied.   Thank you for. your excellent work.
5083,qs2QcycggWU,"I am stunned how much we achieved.
Love the project!
Keep the good work guys!"
5084,qs2QcycggWU,5G use phased array radar
5085,qs2QcycggWU,The way it is present is mind blowing and ur hard work if it's possible can you explain how the connection is made with the rover on Mars
5086,qs2QcycggWU,WOW!
5087,qs2QcycggWU,very informative video for engineers
5088,qs2QcycggWU,Iam not Educated  but i want to say our future is not safe. Human  Growth is killing Humanity.
5089,qs2QcycggWU,"Feedback from a university Mechatronic Systems Engineer:

This video is amazing. I support the channel, just subscribed and I look forward to more videos and I can pretty much garuntee you that these videos will go viral sooner or later so please keep posting!"
5090,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm just going to put this out here. Every Tesla has cameras front, back and sides. If they put any decent level of optics in the Starlink satellites, then Elon Musk is in control of the world's largest private surveillance network. 

He may be a Bond villain, but he's OUR Bond villain. We'll know that he's gone to the Dark Side when he starts using The Boring Company to build his volcanic lair."
5091,qs2QcycggWU,super cool
5092,qs2QcycggWU,"Do y'all use blender for your animations? if so, I would love to see the process of how y'all do your videos"
5093,qs2QcycggWU,Love your work! Need more detailed videos like this!!!
5094,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this.🤩
5095,qs2QcycggWU,Mind Blowing Technology
5096,qs2QcycggWU,"Really great presentetion & animation! Can someone explain, if these Radiations are dangerous for human body and Nature? Aren't all these Frequencies and Signals disturbing for our health, the birds, bees ...the enviroment? 
Thank you."
5097,qs2QcycggWU,great  work
5098,qs2QcycggWU,THANK YOU SO MUCH:
5099,qs2QcycggWU,Hello
5100,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
5101,qs2QcycggWU,DISHY lol
5102,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible !!!!!!!
5103,qs2QcycggWU,WELL DON THANK U
5104,qs2QcycggWU,Ask Putin. LMAO.
5105,qs2QcycggWU,so this mean we can make phase array radars out of starlink dishy !
5106,qs2QcycggWU,good bye night sky
5107,qs2QcycggWU,I watched this video using my Starlink internet and it was flawless.
5108,qs2QcycggWU,Just I got it. Very good  speed.
5109,qs2QcycggWU,Great work! Excellent animation. Thanks a lot.
5110,qs2QcycggWU,"Pity it's hot garbage compared to their claims.
If you're ok with speeds/ping/lag/drop outs that are somewhere between dial-up and copper wire internet speeds, then you're golden.
As of Q3 2022, I know far too many streamers worldwide who've tried their luck with S.L. and it's been farcical as to usability in real time.
To consume social media it's OK at best. To consume streaming media... not good, usually a stuttery, buffering mess. Gaming online? You better be playing chess and other turn based games.
For the moment, it needs work. [cue Gordon Ramsay: ITS FKN RAW! meme]
The theory is there, the execution is either atrocious (or more likely) needs maturing."
5111,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant explaination. thank you for sharing.
5112,qs2QcycggWU,please explain in english😂
5113,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing! I'd be afraid to ask a question as it would expand on my lack of knowledge.
5114,qs2QcycggWU,"Great explanation if “starlink” wasn’t bs. It sounds unnecesary, illogical, and wasteful. Good thing starlink is fake. I saw the “satellites” on two separate occasions and I’m convinced it’s all a lie. The purpose of what I saw may be completely different."
5115,qs2QcycggWU,"HOLY CRAP! I attended DeVry Institute of Technology back in the mid 1970's and ""kinda"" learned this stuff. The AM radio stuff was complex, the FM Radio much more complex, FM Stereo way more complex, B&W TV WAY WAY more complex and color TV infinitely more complex. (That is why I chose digital electronics over analog... My brain can handle 1's and 0's) But all of that is Pre-K compared to this. However, the video broke it down so that even this old guy could follow. Kinda. Good job, y'all"
5116,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing content, love it!!!"
5117,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown! Yet disappointed to realise the time it’d probably take for us here where things takes a tortoise speed to actually get things set up and actually be available or ready for it be fully accessed or utilized
5118,qs2QcycggWU,Does phase array affect the receive portion of the antenna or only transmit?
5119,qs2QcycggWU,"I hope education is like this. Great video as always, if I ever to be able change education it would be like this."
5120,qs2QcycggWU,absolutely incredible
5121,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
5122,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!
5123,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work!
5124,qs2QcycggWU,"well...it is not working for me....Elon got my $100 well over a year and not delivering, is the old trick...making money with the others money, SHAME"
5125,qs2QcycggWU,no im from yemen  im mack find  4G  internet in satellite dish  🙈🙈🙈🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪
5126,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!
5127,qs2QcycggWU,This is what YouTube is for
5128,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video!
5129,qs2QcycggWU,AMAZING! WHAT A CRAZY EFFORT FORM YOU! LOVE IT!!!
5130,qs2QcycggWU,loved it thank you
5131,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work. Thanks for sharing!
5132,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the lesson. The animation is epic.
5133,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing Content! This deserves so much more attention! Masterful renderings to such a beautiful design. The work you have put in to properly understand the documentation down to the PCB placement levels is truly remarkable. As a PhD student in Engineering Science, I found this more motivating than the vast majority of other explanation videos."
5134,qs2QcycggWU,So you're saying that the satellites we have are useless? It's funny that everyone thinks that their phones use satellites
5135,qs2QcycggWU,"Such a great video, thank you"
5136,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the information
5137,qs2QcycggWU,Cool ! Amazing !
5138,qs2QcycggWU,"i am speechless you guys deserve like 50 milion subscribers , i am stunned by the animations , script, the way info is presented throught out the whole video , and the voiceover as well . also I wanna give shoutout to spacex and starlink team to make the internet even more accessible to those who still don't have ( 37% of the population !!!) ."
5139,qs2QcycggWU,"First video by Branch I've watched, and wow, this is one of the best explainer videos I've ever seen."
5140,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, keep up the good work"
5141,qs2QcycggWU,who truly understood this?
5142,qs2QcycggWU,"I don't know diddly about satellites. What I do know is when I used to speak with my cousin by phone in northern Florida, he used to have to walk 1000 feet out to the middle of a country road to get enough reception to carry on a phone conversation with me. Now he can sit in his living room and have that same talk with me, all thanks to Elon Musk."
5143,qs2QcycggWU,very very and very incredible
5144,qs2QcycggWU,Can I buy this and use it in Africa? I'm planning to open my business in Africa. But I need a universal internet connection.
5145,qs2QcycggWU,"wow, had no idea…gah damn some people are reeeeaally smart"
5146,qs2QcycggWU,"Before starlink phased arrays were only used by military and large companies. The cheapest ones used to cost like 50,000 spacex is making them for $500 that’s innovation."
5147,qs2QcycggWU,Some people are scary smart... 😨
5148,qs2QcycggWU,science/engineering madness at display!!!
5149,qs2QcycggWU,"20 years as a Navy ET.... studied Arleigh Burke systems.... kind of figured out phased array on my own. Great presentation though on the nuts and bolts of how it has developed into Quadrant Amplitude M. (What was that M for?).  Have a BS in Biology, Chemistry, Nuclear Tech and a MBA in PM.  Love the brief. Thank you."
5150,qs2QcycggWU,amazing stuff
5151,qs2QcycggWU,This was amazing and you don't have to be making a satellite dish to use this knowledge for other things...
5152,qs2QcycggWU,🔥🔥🔥 science at peak
5153,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best explanation I have ever seen thanks a lottt
5154,qs2QcycggWU,Complex Concept  ->  Branch Education  ->  Simple & Interesting
5155,qs2QcycggWU,What a wonderful explanation......
5156,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
5157,qs2QcycggWU,"Outstanding demonstration of the whole operation of the dish, I honestly don't think this could have been presented any better then the way you guys have done with this video... amazing job 😊👌"
5158,qs2QcycggWU,"Back in 1978, I saw a setup, testing if phase areas will work in directing a signal over a 300 foot distance."
5159,qs2QcycggWU,WAIT SOMETIME CHINA WILL STEAL THE BLUEPRINT AND COPY LOL
5160,qs2QcycggWU,chinas officials announced they needed ways to destroy it since its real problem is how many of them spaceX can launch.
5161,qs2QcycggWU,@@miguellopez3392 ye i saw in news...but destroying someone else property means war...i dont think will happend.
5162,qs2QcycggWU,more like bitchy mc dishface.  we have Starlink.. it has been temperamental.  but at least we now have a basic understanding of this amazing tech.
5163,qs2QcycggWU,"Fabulous presentation and I am certain it has been quite an effort to preapre this video.
Thnaks for sharing and more power to you!   Qucik question:  How do they multiplex the data from many different users?   I am sure there will be contentions and collisions.   Thanks!"
5164,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome. Thank you for the information.
5165,qs2QcycggWU,"Bummer I am Disabled, live off SSD, and can't afford this. 😢"
5166,qs2QcycggWU,"As an engineer and semi-physicist who understands these topics quite well, I was looking for a summary/visual to help explain it to less technical people. This is very well done, and unlike many presentations on the internet, there is no glaringly wrong information. A testament to the research done. Assumptions and simplifications are identified. Good job indeed."
5167,qs2QcycggWU,"As a telecommunications engineering student, this is the kind of video I always wanted to see in this platform. I loved it. Please do more videos about space telecommunications."
5168,qs2QcycggWU,The tech is 🔥🔥🔥
5169,qs2QcycggWU,"mind blowing for the content and researches even more mind blowing of the effort to make the whole video explaination to the smallest , gratefuly!"
5170,qs2QcycggWU,"How fucking smart you have to be to explain that to masses?
That's officially my favorite YouTube channel for a couple of months now."
5171,qs2QcycggWU,"Elon musk calls that satellite Dishy; proving he definitely does not have the brains nor maturity to build that thing. He's a child in a man's body, with his father's money and protection to play with.  😂"
5172,qs2QcycggWU,"@@dlastpage appreciate his money, that he squanders on irrelevant selfish projects.  [One clap here]"
5173,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, and the creator of Python programming language Guido Van Rossum doesn't have the brains to create python because it was named after Monty Python. Nerds aren't known to put puns or jokes in engineering projects."
5174,qs2QcycggWU,Pfffft that was so simple pfttt  smh :)
5175,qs2QcycggWU,TV satellites and legacy internet satellites are not orbiting.  Geostationary.
5176,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant
5177,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! Incredible,and well explained."
5178,qs2QcycggWU,video is so good
5179,qs2QcycggWU,"Well done video. Mind-boggling technology, indeed. So thankfully there are smarter people than me around to create such wonders."
5180,qs2QcycggWU,Great production!
5181,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, good work team!"
5182,qs2QcycggWU,"comment, like & sub [keep up the good work]"
5183,qs2QcycggWU,Godlike Tutorial THANK YOU
5184,qs2QcycggWU,The lobes look funny lol
5185,qs2QcycggWU,"Still a crap car, with a crap owner producing bad technology.  Won't pay a penny in taxes and  won't allow unions, don't buy this crap and put them out of business."
5186,qs2QcycggWU,fools think musk invented this and not the thousands of engineers who actually put in the labor
5187,qs2QcycggWU,"Really Nice, thanks for the time to create and share knowledge, looking forward for more."
5188,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Video
5189,qs2QcycggWU,ok thx!!!
5190,qs2QcycggWU,Magic. Got it.
5191,qs2QcycggWU,That was 10/10

5197,qs2QcycggWU,.
5198,qs2QcycggWU,Great video - like a primer in EE! Thanks
5199,qs2QcycggWU,Good explanation. Keep it up.
5200,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative. Recently received my dish and this vid has cleared up several questions about how it works. Thanks
5201,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nice video, TNX."
5202,qs2QcycggWU,I relate hahah
5203,qs2QcycggWU,Wow !
5204,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
5205,qs2QcycggWU,"How do you defeat Snowy, Rainy and stormy?  How often do you have to clean the surface of the dish?"
5206,qs2QcycggWU,I guess Elon didn’t learn anything from Terminator - SkyNet is operational…
5207,qs2QcycggWU,Good
5208,qs2QcycggWU,"I watched the video to learn how Starlink works but didn’t expect to also learn about how QAM works, which I stumbled upon many years ago (as used by digital cable TV transmissions) and didn’t quite understand back then."
5209,qs2QcycggWU,0:26 data storage of my own
5210,qs2QcycggWU,"Bull....99.9% of ALL communications its done through under water sea cables. You dont have to believe me, just do a simple Google research !!!"
5211,qs2QcycggWU,mind blown....im not worthy....
5212,qs2QcycggWU,"Very extensive video. At some points it was too long, imho. It explains how dishy operates very good. THanks."
5213,qs2QcycggWU,"im lost for words,  EPIC"
5214,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you soo much ❤️❤️❤️
5215,qs2QcycggWU,What I love about video from this channel is how detailed and independent these videos are
5216,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing....
5217,qs2QcycggWU,"wont this pack of satellites  orbiting on space cause problem?
if its not then that will be best tech ever."
5218,qs2QcycggWU,13:03 that voice change though

5224,qs2QcycggWU,An awesome content.
5225,qs2QcycggWU,👍
5226,qs2QcycggWU,Marvelous Explanation
5227,qs2QcycggWU,I don’t understand any of these but I’ve watched the whole video.
5228,qs2QcycggWU,Good stuff..differentiating wavelengths amid an array of levels of amplitudes gets us binary code that is very easy to send and receive...imaging implementing changing the intensity of the many colors in the spectrum to transmit said data..just another level of detail that can bring even more information in pico seconds..or the speed of light....
5229,qs2QcycggWU,Well done
5230,qs2QcycggWU,You said the whole earth my friend. how about Antarctica?
5231,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing
5232,qs2QcycggWU,mindblowing..? dude our military had this technology by the 60s/70s lol
5233,qs2QcycggWU,"I admit I was concentrating on the dishy and it's workings, so I only seen 7 shooting stars."
5234,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video, extremely professional and polished work. It's incredible that we live in a world where this kind of content is accessible to everyone absolutely free of charge. Love your narration style too!"

5239,qs2QcycggWU,well explained
5240,qs2QcycggWU,"omg i love this video! The animations are insanely well done. One thing that was shown wrong tho is that in reallity the sattelites are launched in the same direction as earth rotates. and the geostationary ones don't seem to move at all from earth. 
Thanks again for all the great content, I just found your channel today and instantly subbed!"

5248,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you very much for the great video.
Can you point us to a material that would explain why the beam power is 3500 times and not 1280 times the power of one small antenna ?"
5249,qs2QcycggWU,What a great video! The animation mixed with the technical descriptions 👏🏽👏🏽 Keep it up!
5250,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW, how did I not know about this channel till now. Crazy good stuff."
5251,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! Great explanation!!
5252,qs2QcycggWU,is the phase shifting for coding sample effect the phase shifting for directional purpose?

5259,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You for the deeper tech researched.
5260,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
5261,qs2QcycggWU,fantastic explanation. Very good animation.
5262,qs2QcycggWU,"please read this carefully and to the end ;

Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .

The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he sent his son, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . 
Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . 

Do this, and you will be saved .

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .

You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .

Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ; 

‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’

GOD BLESS ANYONE WHO READS THIS. IF YOU HATE ME I FORGIVE YOU AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOU"
5263,qs2QcycggWU,Bwahahaha. Satellites don’t exist

5276,qs2QcycggWU,"Great Video. The lobe formation and beam forming are very math heavy topics. Kudos to you for making it simpler for wider audience. They can increase antenna size slightly and can add dedicated antennas for both uplink and downlink. That may help to lower latency. Also, lens-enhanced phase array antennas can be used to improve DOA-related issues and Rx/Tx power."

5295,qs2QcycggWU,it's going to get quite interesting to watch other videos if Google tries to program their English (Canadian) language with AI.
5296,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible explanation. Going to have to watch this 3-4 times to really get it!
5297,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
5298,qs2QcycggWU,nice content
5299,qs2QcycggWU,the beam formers and 64 QAM how do they work together...?
5300,qs2QcycggWU,is this internet works for free ??
5301,qs2QcycggWU,Yes school does not teach you how to use soft soft
5302,qs2QcycggWU,you'll guys are awesome. Thankyou for creating such knowledgeable and so accurate animated videos.
5303,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much for simplifying complicated antenna and wave propagation theory into simple-to-understand and inspiring visuals. We electrical engineers owe you for this!
5304,qs2QcycggWU,I was able to change the time on my microwave. So yea...
5305,qs2QcycggWU,Grate video!
5306,qs2QcycggWU,Isn’t this the same as how satellite TV works? How is it extraordinary? Only difference is it sends… nothing extraordinary. TV satellites can be setup to send data… but it would serve no purpose so they designed it only to receive.
5307,qs2QcycggWU,great great great work done.
5308,qs2QcycggWU,I'd like to see the visual representation and changes compared to the 2nd gen dishy.
5309,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible distillation.
5310,qs2QcycggWU,I wish Im a 16 year old now at the AGE OF ELON  interesting and exciting.
5311,qs2QcycggWU,"As a electronic graduate, I understand almost everything, it difficult to explain this complexity but the animation, simplest explanation of everything of how it works, you guys made this engineering a piece of cake..Your team really deserves appreciation."
5312,qs2QcycggWU,How many know 3b1b ?
5313,qs2QcycggWU,This is excellent science!  Thansk.
5314,qs2QcycggWU,Amen Jerryrigeverything.
5315,qs2QcycggWU,lol.  I'm already watching at 2.5 speed :)
5316,qs2QcycggWU,cool
5317,qs2QcycggWU,It would also be nice to have a high level description of how the ground stations track all the multiple satellites in orbit.
5318,qs2QcycggWU,How does the receiver know exactly when the next 6 bit signal starts and stops in order to calculate the phase shift of the next symbol? If there is any noise in the signal determining the exact boundary would be difficult and thus you couldn't work out the exact phase offset with any certainty
5319,qs2QcycggWU,"Generally, the receiver has to derive a clock signal from phase/amplitude transitions in the received data.  So there is an initial synchronization period before valid data can be recovered.  Once synchronized data is being received, the receiver must choose the most likely point on the constellation each symbol belongs in, a probabilistic decision process done by analog means (ie: amplitude comparators)."

5332,qs2QcycggWU,💯
5333,qs2QcycggWU,well done. please make longer and in depth vids more often. even if on a separate channel.
5334,qs2QcycggWU,ปังมาก
5335,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool and informative video
5336,qs2QcycggWU,🔥🔥great explanation
5337,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video!
Subscribing right away."
5338,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool 🤙🏾
5339,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for telling us how long the video is. It helps appreciate the amount of work that goes in to it.
It's an excellent video. I feel guilty watching it for free."
5340,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video
5341,qs2QcycggWU,"I got a question, In future, of Star Link gonna cover every corner of the world, wouldn't that cause a potential hazard for rockets leaving the atmosphere?"
5342,qs2QcycggWU,"Woooooow. It's amazing how you well explained such a complexe subject. Thanks a lot, it was very fun watching your video."
5343,qs2QcycggWU,Holy moly!
5344,qs2QcycggWU,with this technology in the near future will be able to perform surgeries remotely........
5345,qs2QcycggWU,"I just read T-Mobile users will be able to connect to Starlink next year. That's going to be awesome, I just came back form Sequoia National Forrest and there was no reception up there. Only in certain areas. It was like 95% gone, I look forward for the day you can go deep in the forest and still have coverage."
5346,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for your work
5347,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
5348,qs2QcycggWU,...congrats !
5349,qs2QcycggWU,The explanation was very perfect
5350,qs2QcycggWU,Satellites aren't in Space fools! Research
5351,qs2QcycggWU,Why not get two dishes and use one for send /receive
5352,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic video and thorough research work. Watching from Calabar, Nigeria."
5353,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy McFlatFace  rofl
5354,qs2QcycggWU,"fantastic, thanks 😁"
5355,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome breakdown of the technologies... Truly mind blowing 👌
5356,qs2QcycggWU,👍👍👍👍👍
5357,qs2QcycggWU,Oh my god you explained QAM in a few seconds far better than hours of lectures  I've seen.
5358,qs2QcycggWU,wow
5359,qs2QcycggWU,"Good video, why did it take Musk to do this, why wasnt this done by someone else? clearly the technology was already in use..."
5360,qs2QcycggWU,This helped me a lot in understanding the basic principles of antenna communication. Although I'm currently researching satellite communication. A video on satellite-to-satellite communication would be awesome on Starlink.
5361,qs2QcycggWU,"I do love cutting edge technology! I love it more when it is fresh enough for me to not have its physical real time workings up to 100% accurate in my head. Most of the time this means I wind up muddling through my own research process to find some personal understanding. But your video has done an excellent job of explaining it all, in short order; to both to myself and also to my wife (who loves to call herself 'Technically challenged')! 
Very Good job! 

The technology explanations you presented were easy enough to grasp that even too old timers like the wife and I could follow it through easily enough. But the professional quality of the video clip you used really made this educational wonder amazing, genuinely very good entertainment (if that's not a big plus, then nothing can be)! ""A pure joy to watch!"" says the wife."
5362,qs2QcycggWU,"amazing video, the information available is crazy"
5363,qs2QcycggWU,"That was so ducking good, Thank you."
5364,qs2QcycggWU,This was addictively educational! Thank you for sharing!
5365,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video, just missing the part where the satellite gets the internet from (spoiler alert, the satellite doesn’t have a router in space). 
You just won another subscriber, greetings from Dominican Republic."
5366,qs2QcycggWU,Im bored by so many grossly over simplified videos on YouTube that make people think they fully understand something that they now only know a tiny blurry slice of. Im genuinely impressed at the depth of detail and real scientific information and intuitive graphics. I learned a lot and yet I'm challenged with many parts that I can tell I don't understand fully. Thank you for this balance.
5367,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!  I appreciate it!
5368,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent rendition and explanation.
5369,qs2QcycggWU,"All that waste. Just lase it to a relatively stationary satellite. That way you can increase the frequency without sending stray UV rays into the atmosphere. 
Build for the future ray.  
Anyways. You gotta love the push.
A slap on the wrist, to a bankrupt business, to life in prison. What comes next?"
5370,qs2QcycggWU,Super explanation. Keep on creating videos like this. Thanks a lot. Highly appreciate the efforts
5371,qs2QcycggWU,Love this channel!
5372,qs2QcycggWU,yes please create more videos like this ine
5373,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding video on this.  Very good work!
5374,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! I learned a lot :)
5375,qs2QcycggWU,It looks almost like an alien technology... Could you get Samantha Carter from StarGate series as voiceover? :-D :)
5376,qs2QcycggWU,Commenting for YouTube algorithm
5377,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting but we'll outside my understanding, but thank you for the video"
5378,qs2QcycggWU,As a starlink user for nearly a year now this explanation is very interesting. Speeds and service has certainly improved greatly since the beta testing phase as more satellites have been launched.
5379,qs2QcycggWU,20ms that was in the very beginning now it’s more like 300ms or more!
5380,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic! And how well explained too!
5381,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are amazing 👏 ❤️ 💖  thank you for this incredible well done explanation
5382,qs2QcycggWU,amazing video! mind blown to see all the science behind my effort of wasting time on netflix
5383,qs2QcycggWU,very good explanation.
5384,qs2QcycggWU,"I took electronics engineering and I am a cable tech with SCTE training and a backgound audio and crossover design . This description was perfect. I was actually expecting moving parts, but not like the motor suggested. I was thinking more along the lines of a Texas Instrument chip from a DLP TV.. Entertaining and well animated. Thanks."
5385,qs2QcycggWU,"This educational video requires of one an understanding of the most basic concepts, in this case, of wave physics, to fully appreciate the fundamentals that are at work in this complex system.
Thank you for creating videos like this. New subscriber here.
One thing though that I would have wanted included in the explanation is how the phased array antennas are quickly repositioned for the next satellite to track akin to the horizontal retrace signal of an analog TV scanning. Or, did I miss it?  😁"
5386,qs2QcycggWU,"Beautiful clear presentation ! For the next edit you could add the word ""reciprocity"" to explain how the antenna receives aswell as transmits. I have a question: If the beam direction is controlled by relative of phase of signal fed to patch antennas, how come the changing phases of the QAM signal don't upset the beam steering ?"
5387,qs2QcycggWU,"Beamforming works on the higher frequency carrier signal, while the modulation constellation is done on the baseband signal."
5388,qs2QcycggWU,"I absolutely love your content. I’m going to subscribe to Brilliant on the back of this, as I know it will help my daughter in further opening her mind."
5389,qs2QcycggWU,This is the most satisfied I’ve ever been with an educational video presentation hands down
5390,qs2QcycggWU,Make a series on All Elctronics Components.
5391,qs2QcycggWU,"The quality of your videos are just beautiful, informative, and well scripted. As a person with a networking background, this made me appreciate the physics of our world and human ingenuity even more."
5392,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW!, Just plain WOW!
You all made this video moderately understandable! Kudos to those who put this together, But amazings kudos to the scientists and technicians who figured all this out!"
5393,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks so much for sharing this explanation, not that I begin to understand all of the complexities, I do get the general concept. Be someone who hungers to know how things work I appreciate the effort an time put in to make this presentation.
I am definitely a new subscriber!"
5394,qs2QcycggWU,شكرا جزيلا نرجو المزيد من الفديوهات الخاصة بالهاتف الذكي وكيف تعمل باقي المكونات الموجوده في الهاتف
5395,qs2QcycggWU,"In laymen terms, You got a microwave antenna. 1280 antennas are used to collimate the beam. Then by phase shifting you can move the beam to the desired satellite as it moves in location. How far apart is the next satellite to pick up the signal?  Just curious how many lines of machine code where written for this to work properly. So you have to relay info from one satellite to the other or to the source of info on the ground. So it’s another military technology transferable to spacex. I think this is a copy of the iridium satellites that were supposed to do the same thing. Awesome graphics."
5396,qs2QcycggWU,Its a hit
5397,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is so underrated
5398,qs2QcycggWU,Muy bien explicado!
5399,qs2QcycggWU,"Very well done, but incorrectly showed geosynchronous satellites (used for TV reception) rotating around the Earth as if they weren't geostationery."
5400,qs2QcycggWU,I bet it is no different then dish network and direct tv !! A storm and single is lost !!
5401,qs2QcycggWU,did u watch the video?
5402,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi, I'm a robotics engineer with a physics background. I absolutely loved the amount of detail this video went into. Very pleasant surprise. I work on systems that use LTE networks and had a good amount of background coming in and still learned so much.

If you're looking for ideas for future videos I'd love to see one on how blood testing machines work. After watching all the Theranos content I could find online I'm left curious as to how modern day blood testing machines work and the physics behind them."
5403,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a serious question

5404,qs2QcycggWU,I honestly feel like I need to pay after watching this - truly well made and highly thorough! Thank you!
5405,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this about Starlink many thanks for the team effort’s
5406,qs2QcycggWU,First video I've watched from you guys... earned a sub instantly. Extremely impressive video quality and information sharing all around. Thank you!
5407,qs2QcycggWU,The micro geometric's involved are alone amazing. Your explanations have my brain buzzing and I haven't even finished watching once yet. I am often frustrated by lack of technical detail in technical videos; NOT here. If there is something I don't understand I will Google or Duck it. So please keep making excellent videos like this. Some may think this technology is yet more evidence that Elon Musk is an Alien or from the future. If so I hope he is a friendly force🙂 Thanking all of you for this great video.
5408,qs2QcycggWU,"I hated electrical engineering in university and eventually left it after graduation, there were so many confusing concepts and the classes were not helpful . This video seems very clear, especially with all the animations shown. Gives a better idea what’s going on in things we can’t see. I wish I watched these long ago."
5409,qs2QcycggWU,"This is awesome! In 60 days i'll be back, so see if you reached 1 million subscribers!"
5410,qs2QcycggWU,I wish i had found this channel when i was a student. The production quality and ease of explanation are amazing .

5421,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content! Thank you!
5422,qs2QcycggWU,i think you missed how the correction of data transmission is done here
5423,qs2QcycggWU,The main flaw is there's no such thing as a flying satellite in (orbit?) in the sky😀🤔.
5424,qs2QcycggWU,Great work 🥳 Thank you 💜
5425,qs2QcycggWU,I feel very lucky to know This 🌟🌟🌟
5426,qs2QcycggWU,Great work! Super quality animations and very precise information shown in very simple way! Thanks!
5427,qs2QcycggWU,I accidentally witnessed a bright cluster of Starlinks cross the sky at 5am a week back. Like a string of pearls.
5428,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for making this video!

5430,qs2QcycggWU,"Very nicely done. 

As a former MPEG/DVB trainer, I can relate to the amount of work, bringing the complex subjects of satellite transmission, phased array antennas, beam forming, modulation accessible to a wider audience.

Very well done."
5431,qs2QcycggWU,I'm in awe learning about this amazing piece of technology. Such leaps are achieved by mankind.

5433,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible content.
5434,qs2QcycggWU,awesome source
5435,qs2QcycggWU,🤯🤯
5436,qs2QcycggWU,thanks!! .. please keep posting .. a treat to watch.
5437,qs2QcycggWU,"Way cool. What an informative video, I'm amazed by the high quality and detail presented"
5438,qs2QcycggWU,Good job man love u from India Punjab Amritsar
5439,qs2QcycggWU,"Question, the video didn't explain how the satellite signals get switched without latency. Can someone add some comments?"
5440,qs2QcycggWU,Whatever
5441,qs2QcycggWU,Great!
5442,qs2QcycggWU,Hey thank for the knowledge
5443,qs2QcycggWU,"Erm, You connect your dish to a base station. Your not connecting to an actual satellite. The satellites beam down to the dish. Exactly the same way Sky TV etc works."
5444,qs2QcycggWU,@Branch Education.   Am really interested in learning how you do the modeling of those components.   Please am waiting your message
5445,qs2QcycggWU,thanks
5446,qs2QcycggWU,"Good job, we need more quality content like this! :)"
5447,qs2QcycggWU,"Back to analogue amplitude modulation.  Okay, a bit more complexity added.   😛
Edit: an elegant lesson about the process! Great work!"
5448,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow. This was absolutely amazing.
So comprehensive and beautifully presented.
Can't wait to see more!"
5449,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing 💯💎🧠🦾
5450,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating and comprehensive - TU!
5451,qs2QcycggWU,I think this is great
5452,qs2QcycggWU,"Here to say that I liked, subscribed, and commented ❤️❤️"
5453,qs2QcycggWU,This is really high quality education and could be used by teachers everywhere
5454,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding video. You managed to cover so many complex concepts in a clear and concise fashion. The graphics make a world of difference to visualize the material being covered. Great job and keep posting. We can all get a little smarter on what it takes to live in this digital world. Thank you 🙏🏻
5455,qs2QcycggWU,"Amplitude cam be changed by increasing the power,frequency by increasing the on/off speed but I didn't understand how can u phase shift a signal?"
5456,qs2QcycggWU,Top tier incredible content!
5457,qs2QcycggWU,Great animations! Keep doing good work!
5458,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
5459,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, fantastic. My mind was blown several times."
5460,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
5461,qs2QcycggWU,Quality stuff
5462,qs2QcycggWU,Are Star Link satellites still sending broad ranged signal waves to reach multiple different Dishys? How can really a lot of different people be provided with signals all in the same very narrow frequency band? Are data streams only separated as usual by initial address codes ans such established features?
5463,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing work and visual Performance!! Thank you!!!!!
How can phase modulation be used for the signal if phase is required as well for directing at the satellite?"
5464,qs2QcycggWU,"the visuals are great, all the infos are  well explained + your voice makes me sleepy. a perfect video, thank you for this high quality content :P"
5465,qs2QcycggWU,This name sounds like something I’ve seen on a sci-fi movie about technology taking over mankind.
5466,qs2QcycggWU,Can you make a video about induction cooktop...
5467,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible animation quality, excellent explanations, bravo 👏"
5468,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing science... lost in the electrons
5469,qs2QcycggWU,"Light is so amazing! Light is part of God's essence, as is love 💕"
5470,qs2QcycggWU,Best explain video i've ever seen. Nice
5471,qs2QcycggWU,"I was supposed to listen to Lofi music, and I came across this video for some reason. Anyway great work!"
5472,qs2QcycggWU,"So... my question is... How do I hack starlink to get free internet? LOL I bet someone will figure it out. Thanks for the detailed video, it was very informative."
5473,qs2QcycggWU,This is what we need to be teaching in school
5474,qs2QcycggWU,"Do you love musk? Do you worship musk? Do you want to be musk? Do you need musk? Are you tired of libs? Do you demand a free Amuskica? $100,000 donations to musk receive free entry to musk-give. Grand prize is one jar muskcav, made with real rotten musk collected by musk personal pedicures. Additional prizes include one-whiff muskjars, a rare capture of muskgas. Great for ritual wicca muskings or personal use."
5475,qs2QcycggWU,Wowi
5476,qs2QcycggWU,"Had NO IDEA that Starlink even operated in the 14 gigahertz range. Most people have no concept of how difficult that is to manage ... stray capacitance alone makes PCB design a nightmare ... which Im sure modern software can help with, but then add to that issue 1200 antennas ... mind blown!"
5477,qs2QcycggWU,"Are Canadian subtitles ~11:40 the same as US subtitles with "", eh"" appended on the end of each line?"
5478,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You So Very Much.
5479,qs2QcycggWU,[̲̅p][̲̅r][̲̅o][̲̅m][̲̅o][̲̅s][̲̅m] 👏

5482,qs2QcycggWU,"Resonance=SDIcapibilitiesOpposistionOffensiveMIRV'sWouldHaveToUseGraphineToAvoidTheDominioLinearToSayThierGuidenceSystem&PrimerOnNeutronOrNuclearWarheadsOr,Missles"
5483,qs2QcycggWU,Very effectual and efficient. I picket up more useful information in this video than entire classes of legacy college. ;-)
5484,qs2QcycggWU,"Opposing electric fields may not cancel out with one hundred percent certainty. It may just deflect the waves outwards and minimize the frequency of said waves past a point of interaction. I think we should rethink the way we imagine these interactions as information that our minds have evolved to interpret in the most efficient way possible. Like an aerodynamic colliding at a vertex and becoming very small as a result, assuming the Universe acts in the same way from a macroscopic and microscopic viewpoint we can assume that with the age of the Universe that these fields have likely reached a point of maximum efficiency by now. Like the singularity inside of a blackhole."
5485,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
5486,qs2QcycggWU,wow!
5487,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video. As an RF engineer who has designed satellite ground stations, this is by far the best video and training I have ever seen."
5488,qs2QcycggWU,"I disagree with the design of the satellite, so little coverage, and SO MUCH SPACE DEBRIS! at his can lead to LOADS of future problems. I like his goal. But, space missions will be made way more dangerous by these.

I STILL LIKE HIS IDEA! ITS JUST MY OPINION!"
5489,qs2QcycggWU,Yep then a big hologram perhaps Second Coming of Christ or big lies... invasions. Because we are in the hands of the government.
5490,qs2QcycggWU, Physics   1280 = 3500 antennas @ 12ghz  / 2ms latency  = 540mb/s  in  H.264   (25  shooting start)  👍👍😎
5491,qs2QcycggWU,"Not only is the tech behind the Starlink system incredible, this video itself is a work of art.  I'm blown away by how well it explains the complex ideas in this application."
5492,qs2QcycggWU,"ofc I liked this video, 1 thing I have been searching though, is it possible to build a smaller/tiny version of dishy at home ? ... could you do 1 DIY of the ~1280 small antenna? .. the main reason behind it is because high techs like dishy are usually restricted where freedom is restricted too... a DIY might be the only way out for some ppl."
5493,qs2QcycggWU,Just wow😮🔥
5494,qs2QcycggWU,"I watch it at sped x1.0  -- thank you for having recorded it at human speed.   I have plenty of time -- I am retired and no children or pets around me - so,  plenty of time.  thanks again."
5495,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!!
5496,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Thankyou so much for this. It resonates on so many wavelengths. :-)
5497,qs2QcycggWU,"This is fantastic, thank you for this amazing content."
5498,qs2QcycggWU,I really appreciate your effort and the level of detail. Also great are the creators comments in the english-canadian subtitles! Just brilliant :)
5499,qs2QcycggWU,Not true
5500,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant video! I am amazed of humanity's technological accomplishments.
5501,qs2QcycggWU,That's  very cool.... Actually that's  how the new radars on new planes like f35 works...
5502,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown! Also I wonder what programs were used to animate this? Good job you all.
5503,qs2QcycggWU,read FULL description
5504,qs2QcycggWU,elon sucks
5505,qs2QcycggWU,Simple as salt to understand.
5506,qs2QcycggWU,hatts off to you guys for simplifying the complex technology
5507,qs2QcycggWU,Cool
5508,qs2QcycggWU,But is it dangerous to have that many satellites in the sky? What if skynet creates judgement day and the sattelies decide to crash into earth ????
5509,qs2QcycggWU,Today I understood the EMW concept here in this video very clearly rather than in my graduate. I belong to ECE ✌️ Peace out.
5510,qs2QcycggWU,Amazingly clever technology and great video! I wonder if this technology can effect insects  and birds ability to navigate? We know that they all use the earth's electromagnetic field for navigation. And we've seen bees and other flying insects negatively effected by a number of frequencies used in GSM technology. And sure Starlink uses very different frequencies - but I wonder what research was done on this important issue.
5511,qs2QcycggWU,I am proud for ur team n effort
5512,qs2QcycggWU,👍👍👍
5513,qs2QcycggWU,...
5514,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate this video
5515,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this video! I found it interesting and informative. :) A bit more of common knowledge adquired thanks to you!
5516,qs2QcycggWU,"I just LOVE the old portable radio you show, same one from Gilligans Island 🤣"
5517,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for high quality content!
5518,qs2QcycggWU,FANTASTIC VIDEO. You’ve earned a subscriber for life!
5519,qs2QcycggWU,now that the whole world is connected wireless what is next ?
5520,qs2QcycggWU,This is explained unreal. I am speechless.
5521,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Subscribed and liked. More please.
5522,qs2QcycggWU,Not just a informative it also needs hearts to make...❤️how cool the animation was 😀
5523,qs2QcycggWU,another thing that no one talks its that does little satelites will one day will fall and burn in the earth athmospher.
5524,qs2QcycggWU,Hexagons are the bestagons.
5525,qs2QcycggWU,unbelievable value in a video
5526,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, the explanation is really easy to understand, and the animation is just wow. The amount of research on this kind of topic is not an easy task"
5527,qs2QcycggWU,Lot's of respect for you sir..... you are providing such a detailed video for free.... love you from bottom of heart 💓
5528,qs2QcycggWU,This an amazing work done here. Thanks a lot. So professional.
5529,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible video
5530,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing, What a Hardwork  put on this vidoe👐"
5531,qs2QcycggWU,For the hardwork...!!👍
5532,qs2QcycggWU,Thank u 4 this video
5533,qs2QcycggWU,"I would love to see a video on wifi and mesh systems, how they work, etc."
5534,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
5535,qs2QcycggWU,EvA.I First borne  prophecy .Then God took me up in the God box and showed me all the satellites which were making people angry. so daddy don’t be angry because it not you.
5536,qs2QcycggWU,Oh yeah your all amazed I’m on my starlink now and it’s pretty crappy service I tell you. Technology oooooo so good. F@&k no garbage all this future bs make our lives easier hell no I used to drive truck with no problems b4 2005 then technology started messing with it and just made my work harder and by 2020 it was just beyond ridiculous that I quit cause I can’t be a slave and make less money and hate the job I used to be passionate about driving is my life now all I do is drive around in my classic cars and trucks that never break down and give me no problems and burn way less fuel than a rocket burn that burns as much as 2-1/2 billion of my vehicles every second. Yeah technology is so much better. NOT. Wake up masses of brainwashed morons.
5537,qs2QcycggWU,"I have starlink, it's more consistent than my cable provider, a rocket o lying burns the fuel of 15 gas cars in their life time not billions, and it replaces infrastructure that would have created a lot more pollution if we didn't build it in space, keep your head in that hole."
5538,qs2QcycggWU,@@miguellopez3392 wow you are quite uniformed about rocket fuel it burn 2 million times more than a family car per second open your eyes while reading lies. Do sum research then argue. I’m not educating you do it yourself. You dam liberal hugger. Unreal
5539,qs2QcycggWU,Easily the best tech related YouTube channel
5540,qs2QcycggWU,Just amazing
5541,qs2QcycggWU,"The are 550km from sea level, not from the atmosphere"
5542,qs2QcycggWU,Works just like SKYNET
5543,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, Sir."
5544,qs2QcycggWU,Knowledge can not be destroyed it can only be transformed.
5545,qs2QcycggWU,"TLDR version:
We have given a billionaire halfwit free reign with no oversight, to litter the sky with thousands of very short lived temporary satellites in a desperate attempt to provide some reasonable coverage for a very expensive service by comparison to regular fixed line services, giving not a damn about potential Kessler syndrome from the folly of these rich idiots. Starlink has already has a few near misses, wont be long at this rate before some of Elons junk takes out something potentially more important."
5546,qs2QcycggWU,"TLDR, I don't know that starlink satellites have krypton ion thrusters that de orbit them and menouver to avoid Kessler syndrome, I also don't know that the service it's replacing for many is $200-1000 month internet that is 1/40 the speed and reliability because it's geo stationary satalite and the nerest cable provider won't build in your area unless you pay the $30,000 just to run a line let alone pay $2k a month for it."
5547,qs2QcycggWU,"@@miguellopez3392 Do you seriously think that I am not aware that they de-orbit after a time, only to be replaced with ever more junk in their wake to perform the same function. I could not give a flying fuck if they did a loop d'loop on the way down, that does not stop the fact that they are as much a menace as is Elon himself, nor does it alter the fact that they have already been involved in near misses in terms of collisions.

As for satellite broadband in general, that has been with us for 20+ years without Elon's Junk, I can buy that right now for £20 to £80 depending on what speed I want and have been able to for those decades and there is  the option of mobile broadband, signal permitting.

Here is a more professional debunking of the bullshit of Elon's and Startlink:
https://youtu.be/2vuMzGhc1cg

After which, once you've watched it, you will be left with a choice to either cling on to personal beliefs or accept reality and alter those beliefs accordingly.

But in brief, my opinion is the rich should be banned from space by Law. They did nothing to earn their money and should be allowed to burn millions of dollars they extracted from their piss poor workers just to give the rich a fucking joyride of no scientific benefit, so he can keep his flailing ventures afloat via mass subsidy and the stupidity of venture capitalists. Hopefully, his ventures can only go on so long before he will have his Theranos moment, given they all tend to lose money hand over fist while he lives off of the stupidity of others."
5548,qs2QcycggWU,wow!!! I am a graduate of business and finance and understand the logic of the techology.. this channel is the best... you can make it in a longer or video or chapters.. heck movies recap are longer..
5549,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the channel I've always wanted on youtube, one that dives into how technology works using good quality animation. Very Great Video!"
5550,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, that was great!"
5551,qs2QcycggWU,"if youtube was pures videos like this, ALL humanity would reach peace and cosmological perspective."
5552,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant. Appropriate. Relevant. Concise. Precise.
Thank you. 👍"
5553,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellites ""orbiting the Earth"" 😂😂😂"
5554,qs2QcycggWU,The details are freaking amazing :O :O :O
5555,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
5556,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video. One thing I don't understand is how one satellite can deal with the incoming traffic from many many Dishys at the same time. How does it not get all of the signals ""mixed up"" so to speak? And similarly, how does it accurately beam the data back to all of the dishys?"
5557,qs2QcycggWU,This will be a big problem for the spacecraft. A collision will happen in the future
5558,qs2QcycggWU,"The video is amazingly accurate, I am a radio engineer and I am very impressed with all the details and precisions when you explain the phase array antenna and beamforming.  Congratulation, this is great work!"
5559,qs2QcycggWU,Some of it is false.
5560,qs2QcycggWU,"@@SilverSergeant You have to be more specific about what is false, I am listening."
5561,qs2QcycggWU,"As a meteorologist who constantly followed the development of weather based phased array radar, it's always hard to explain phased arrays to my friends outside the field.  They are perplexed by my excitement with the technology, but it has so many uses, even in your home wifi."
5562,qs2QcycggWU,great effort
5563,qs2QcycggWU,"The magnetic and the electric fields are 90° out of phase, correct?"
5564,qs2QcycggWU,Please make a video on crypto currency
5565,qs2QcycggWU,Ex-Airforce basic and advanced electronics for Tech Control. 30751X for u airdales if I remember correctly. Excellent video. Wish we had this when i was trying to wrap my head around calculus & trig.
5566,qs2QcycggWU,"Soo cool, I don't know if u already done a video about mid flight internet in specific, it would be interesting too 🤯"
5567,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you 1000 times for this great video 😃❤️
5568,qs2QcycggWU,Very long and full of info… Nice presentation…
5569,qs2QcycggWU,It looks like what you are doing is vibrating it and got it stronger and faster
5570,qs2QcycggWU,Wow it can jump and build momentum nice thank
5571,qs2QcycggWU,Does this mean you can amplify and build up the momentum?
5572,qs2QcycggWU,this video is levels above your oversimplified clickbaits you will find anywhere else... great job <3
5573,qs2QcycggWU,Please create more.
5574,qs2QcycggWU,You made this very easy to understand for a person like me with very limited engineering knowledge.  Great work!!!!!!!!
5575,qs2QcycggWU,This brings me new curiosity on our future in tech.
5576,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing presentation, both visual and verbal."

5591,qs2QcycggWU,"Watching this via Starlink makes my Dishy even more impressive. 

Really interesting video. Thank you!"
5592,qs2QcycggWU,It is astonishing how well you explain it!!!
5593,qs2QcycggWU,"This was way more fascinating that I thought, would be interesting to explain how the satellite broadcasts and receives signals from multiple dishy's simultaneously"
5594,qs2QcycggWU,Great
5595,qs2QcycggWU,Great vid
5596,qs2QcycggWU,💪🏽
5597,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!!! One question though how the satellite determine the GPS location so accurately.as per my knowledge GPS has errors in pinpoint location.signal to be locked in GPS has to be extremely precise how do they achieve that?
5598,qs2QcycggWU,Musk is from another planet and his engineers are from where he is from. I have proof of that.

5613,qs2QcycggWU,12 gigahertz or 1.21 gigawatts? Why giga? Let's turn it up to 400 terahertz. You should be able to see a visible hue at that level of frequency.
5614,qs2QcycggWU,This is mindblowing. Thank you for providing this truly amazing content!
5615,qs2QcycggWU,That was amazing!!
5616,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
5617,qs2QcycggWU,such a good video and channel.  you all are wonderful.  sincerely a fan.
5618,qs2QcycggWU,A lot of people much more educated than I am here. I am so happy the creators chose to keep it simple! Great video!
5619,qs2QcycggWU,"I have no words..😶 you are amazing..🤯 i'm just gonna say  ""Thank you so much"" for this video..❤"
5620,qs2QcycggWU,"Your video is Discover,National Geographic level.Thank you for give such informative video."
5621,qs2QcycggWU,I love how you break down engineering in visuals it’s so educational
5622,qs2QcycggWU,Great!
5623,qs2QcycggWU,Man this is what TLC use to be.
5624,qs2QcycggWU,"I thought a satellite was just sitting in its fix orbit position towards certain area or country and serving data transmission (traveling with earth), and not traveling around the globe like a International Space Station do."
5625,qs2QcycggWU,"That is a Geo stationary satalite, it is 40 times further away than a low orbit satalite and therfore is slower at communicating information."
5626,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!  Always wondered how Starlink worked.
5627,qs2QcycggWU,"The distances above ground are basically correct, but how is it the producers of this video do not show that a satellite broadcasting TV signals is geostationary - ie. orbiting around the earth at a FIXED (""stationary"") point above the ground?  

If that fundamental function of how all (non-Starlink) broadcast TV satellites work is not understood, how can we trust that the rest of this video is even halfway correct?!"
5628,qs2QcycggWU,"This is BS, there is no SPACE out there, only WATER exists above, don't buy this BS, You can't fool me ."
5629,qs2QcycggWU,Then go swim in it.
5630,qs2QcycggWU,"Please more videos like this. This was incredible to watch and you guys make innovative technologies make so much sense minus the jargon. Amazing work, keep going this is an awesome video."
5631,qs2QcycggWU,"Not one mention of alien technology,  lol . I didn't  think I was going to understand how it worked,  but you did a great  job."
5632,qs2QcycggWU,Spoiler alert: it works as well as full self drive
5633,qs2QcycggWU,You explain things well. 😎
5634,qs2QcycggWU,BRILLIANT 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Thanks a million
5635,qs2QcycggWU,👌
5636,qs2QcycggWU,lovely. i love this amount of crammed comprehensible information. this kind if learning density keeps my brain fed. thank you guys.
5637,qs2QcycggWU,Super
5638,qs2QcycggWU,"Spectacular review, now I can show others about this fantastic improvement to mankind & communications!"
5639,qs2QcycggWU,"Brilliant video there, BE! I have two 2 questions.
1. I wonder what would be the signal drift encountered (and how it's corrected on board) in that 2ms uplink and 2ms downlink delay between dishy and satellite. 
2. How does the satellite maintain its on board clock frequency to prevent relativistic errors, considering the communication is light speed."
5640,qs2QcycggWU,"1. Software seems to be a fix.

2. Satalites usally communicate with other satalites that have atomic clocks and reference them, kind of like block chain."
5641,qs2QcycggWU,"If they get Dishy at a low enough price, Dishy can have the whole world."
5642,qs2QcycggWU,I'm blown away at the speed that this technology operates.
5643,qs2QcycggWU,I am grateful for brilliant people who bring us these cutting edge technologies. Schools must never lose site of the importance of stem programs.
5644,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice
5645,qs2QcycggWU,I’m in awe of this channel. I’ve never found anything that can explain such complex topics so deeply and clearly. If only school was this educational.
5646,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video and explaination !
5647,qs2QcycggWU,What an absolutely amazing video
5648,qs2QcycggWU,Those videos should be in school program
5649,qs2QcycggWU,the best science visualization channel❤️
5650,qs2QcycggWU,😍😍😍
5651,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
5652,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation and animation
5653,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
5654,qs2QcycggWU,I've learned how to explain things to people
5655,qs2QcycggWU,This is incredible.  Well done team. #Subscribed
5656,qs2QcycggWU,This seems like a very bad idea. What could go wrong?
5657,qs2QcycggWU,"Outstanding! ""Multi-diciplinary Engineering"" should be a course of study!"
5658,qs2QcycggWU,"This is like ""how its made"" but for advanced tech instead of soda."
5659,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation. Thank you! 👏👏🙏
5660,qs2QcycggWU,"""This video is quite long as it shows in-depth details""

Fuck yeah!"
5661,qs2QcycggWU,This can’t be good for human bodies.  All those signals being blasted at earth constantly.  Think about it! Sounds like population control though cancer increase.
5662,qs2QcycggWU,"uhh...there's nothing mind blowing to be honest...it's just enhanced old technology. 
If they create a phone without the dish and receive signal directly from the satelites...then that's mind blowing
kind of dumb to boost Starlink as if it's very innovative and technologically advanced...."
5663,qs2QcycggWU,really nice video
5664,qs2QcycggWU,FASCINANTE!!! GRACIAS POR COMPARTIR ESTA INFORMACIÓN.🙏🙏🙏❤
5665,qs2QcycggWU,I love the technology 💓💓💓 that's incredible and interesting ❤️❤️
5666,qs2QcycggWU,"don't be afraid to produce longer videos of this quality, I will still watch them two or three times like this One . For sure not for counting stars 😃"
5667,qs2QcycggWU,question: where the dishy get the internet from?
5668,qs2QcycggWU,"thank you very much, very helpful information

keep going bro ✌️👍"
5669,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm a satellite tv dish installer in my country, and  I really find this video interesting. Very detailed and not so technical in some ways."
5670,qs2QcycggWU,... 🙂 literally the best content on yt
5671,qs2QcycggWU,"#Gratitude 
I call all this Magic of Scientific expertise 
Bravo 
Very Good 
Can't learn with this presentation 

#PEACE"
5672,qs2QcycggWU,one of the best illustrations ever
5673,qs2QcycggWU,wow
5674,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the video. Glad I stumbled across your channel. You've earned a sub.
5675,qs2QcycggWU,"i believe the scientist got this knowledege by selling their soul into satan or extraterrestrial being haha, the complexity i cant imagine, thousand hour of research and work by multi disciplinary study, i literally amazed that humanity is able to achieve this, while thousand years ago we started by writing on stone, now we are in here"
5676,qs2QcycggWU,How dose the satalight handle muliple dishs at the same time.
5677,qs2QcycggWU,This explanation is gold. Never knew this much of engineering goes into starlink.
5678,qs2QcycggWU,I want to know how to make a simple antenna 📡
5679,qs2QcycggWU,"Конструкция и работа, сложнее чем активная фазированная антенна. Прекрасный обзор."
5680,qs2QcycggWU,You are my one of the favourite learning channels on youtube. I always show your videos to my students as reference when needed.
5681,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible demonstration, long life to engineer who create these things."
5682,qs2QcycggWU,Dang! Wow!
5683,qs2QcycggWU,U Do an Excellent job with the graphics and explaining Standing Waves which perform signal cancellation and multiplication.
5684,qs2QcycggWU,"Great work and so simple to understand.... thanks !

Would it be possible in next generation to send and receive at the same time ?  If so, will the whole setup (Dishy and Sat) will require change in HW or just a piece of SW update would do ??

How maintenance of Satellite would look like and what is the average Lifecycle of their operation ?

How do you control the Satellite SW if needed ?  remote connection ??  

how to make sure connection with terrestrial big Sats to transfer internet from and to Starlink is at best ?  if GPS fails to give the exact details or synch ?

So many things ...but that's good for now."
5685,qs2QcycggWU,😊 thanks
5686,qs2QcycggWU,Unreal video. Very well done. Thank you.
5687,qs2QcycggWU,"Great Presentation, enjoyed every second of this eye opener. Thankyou.  High power MIMO? or a Ruckus on SETEROIDS ? Beamforming? has been around."

Holy what?!"
5691,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for the explanation.
Very good video and content.
It was worth watching to the end."
5692,qs2QcycggWU,Watched at 1.75x speed playback
5693,qs2QcycggWU,"Please boycott this technology/ Starlink/ Elon Musk ... all this radiation will harm us severely. As a matter of fact, it's already messing up honey bees ...  we need to disconnect. If we don't stop Starlink soon, they will pollute our whole sky with thousands of satellites, making it impossible to gaze at the stars at night :/ Also, what if there was a comet about to hit Earth .. we wouldn't be able to launch missiles because of all that garbage floating in our atmosphere....!!!"
5694,qs2QcycggWU,wow
5695,qs2QcycggWU,Really great explanation. Not just of starlink but phased antennae and beamforming too. Very easy to understand but conveys how it works without overloading with theory. Subscribed!

5752,qs2QcycggWU,"Geez, this is awesome! What a quality content you deliver!"
5753,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing and excellent description. I got my BS in engineering in 1982 and phased array didn't exist then. We had an Apple II in our lab and 5.25"" floppy drives were the norm. I've read some about phased array radars since then but never really understood how the antennas worked until this video. Great job on the video! Kudos the the smart folks who figured this out and the ones who funded and supported them while they were doing it."
5754,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually the US Navy had a phased array radar system on the USS Observation Island around 1985. My father actually worked on this project at Raytheon. I remember him taking me on the ship when I was a teen and just being in amazement over the size of this thing on the deck of the ship...When I graduated engineering school back east, my first job was making the wave guide source elements at Chomerics in Woburn, MA.....Sorry to ramble"

5790,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowingly amazing.
5791,qs2QcycggWU,"very nice video and great explanation but I still don't get how the satellite communicate with individual dishes 
say one satellite is supposed to cover 20 dishes, each one is supposed to receive different data does the sat just send all data at once and the dishes just filter out what they need or does the sat divide its dishes into smaller ones and each one points at one dish through phase shifting ?"
5792,qs2QcycggWU,I'm an electrical engineer. This video is thorough and detailed but in a very simplified way. This video is absolutely fantastic! New subscriber!
5793,qs2QcycggWU,brilliant
5794,qs2QcycggWU,😳
5795,qs2QcycggWU,I did not expect this detail or level of gfx. Well done.
5796,qs2QcycggWU,This video was incredible
5797,qs2QcycggWU,This presentation was brilliant! I'm interested in learning more about Starlink.

5803,qs2QcycggWU,"26:00 why did you skip the crispy detail of delay lines used to implement beam forming in phase antennas ? 

Also the first whide use was in French military planes, and they were te first radars able to « see » many « invisible » American planes   during Gulf war  ... They are used both as radar and communication device. They have the advantage to not move physically 1nd still point a chosen place. 1also, you can transmit a data to your friend a way that enemy can't even sens you are existing, or worst, send pure noise to enemy."
5804,qs2QcycggWU,thank you!

5806,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing 👍
5807,qs2QcycggWU,"This is an verry good video, but you nead to uppdate the animatons, becuse the the satellite receiver can tilt 45 degrees, and rotate 365° to track the satellites in REAL time. (live) 
I say that becuse in the video you make it seam like the satellite receiver are standing still, its yousing the rotaton and tilt to expand the field of communication wave area to always have the best possible contact with the satellite."
5808,qs2QcycggWU,I was an electrical engineer a long time ago. It’s great to see some of the fundamentals of transmission lines and signal processing in a clear visual manner. Great work.

5812,qs2QcycggWU,The most understandable explaining of 64 QAM I've ever seen
5813,qs2QcycggWU,yes my mind is blown....
5814,qs2QcycggWU,How does it handle more than one user at a time?
5815,qs2QcycggWU,Totally mind blowing explanation and animations. Learnt a lot. Support from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
5816,qs2QcycggWU,Wow - the graphics/animations are just amazing - excellent. This is the cutting edge of tech in 2022. I learned about QAM early 90's in Digital Switching for Telecoms.
5817,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
5818,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink satellite manage to searve 1000s of dishes on the ground with just 2 phased array antennas? How does it know to which dish it has to send the data?
5819,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, the video has surpassed the ugly video of Comment Sense Skeptic :))"
5820,qs2QcycggWU,Speed 1.5 is too slow to understand. It should be 1.75 or 2 already for the first go.
5821,qs2QcycggWU,amazing best explanation ever
5822,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work
5823,qs2QcycggWU,10000 satellites in low earth orbit sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Surely this this is a practical and economic barrier for this tech to.. take off..
5824,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent information…
5825,qs2QcycggWU,These types of videos deserves more views than pranks and nonsense.
5826,qs2QcycggWU,Mind Blowing !

5833,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool part is that techno pig is using it to directly fun his other space projects so it doesn't sit in a bank account, hey can you work for mee for free, it's a lot of labor and I'm not paying for your Gas but can you?"
5834,qs2QcycggWU,Magnifiquement bien détaillé.
5835,qs2QcycggWU,"Praise for the explanation and 3D Animation (Pls think of creating one video about same, showing about how you do it).
I can draw a parallel between sender/receiver set-up in Satcomm and Telecomm. Important level of detail that you have researched, explained and projected is fantastic. Your video can serve as start point for anyone who is looking to learn phased array antenna, beam steering, beam forming and 64 QAM. Visually amazing animations clearly show the EM and antenna concepts. Good luck to you for next video !! 😊"
5836,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink works the following way: 
1- Convince Starlink investors it's a good investment
2-Take the money, make a satellite with 20% of it.
3-Use the remaining 80% to send a Space X rocket, and put a satellite into space.
4-After some time, the fact that 1 isn't true will appear. File for bankruptcy.

You got yourself a nice transfer of capital from a company that has no future to another company that needs to show it has a market."
5837,qs2QcycggWU,"Months old numbers say they have 500k subscribers which bring in $600mil/year. Now martime and contracts. with Starship they can launch 300 satellites at once, so it's profitable with only a couple million subscribers."
5838,qs2QcycggWU,"@@timc7035 ""They can"" ? OK, you're a Musk fanboy. FYI, Starship doesn't work yet."
5839,qs2QcycggWU,@@piwi2005 lol so when it does what other poor excuse will you make of why starlink won't work? Especially now that the pentagon and US military have given high praise for the system ls preformance in the Ukraine? In its first year it already matched the user base of the other largest internet satellite provider in the world with significantly better average speeds and up time with just falcon starlink launches.
5840,qs2QcycggWU,"@@piwi2005 It will by 2023. Betting that Srtarship can't make it to LEO is a fools bet, but you can make that bet all you want."
5841,qs2QcycggWU,"@@timc7035This is an empty phrase. It's like saying that  if the hypertube can do 1000 mph in a vacuum tube, it can certainly do 100. You are taking as present facts things that just do not exist yet."
5842,qs2QcycggWU,@@piwi2005 I said it's likely it will be working by 2023 not that it presently works. Unless you think Starship will only happen by 2030 or never a year or two delay past 2023 still ends up with SpaceX easily filling out their constellation at very low cost. Betting that they won't make it to LEO therefore bankruptcy worked out terribly for F9.
5843,qs2QcycggWU,"Highly researched video!, it certainly shows the amount of time it took to make this documentary.And the video animation are on the next level. Loved every bit of this video"
5844,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful! I am a telecom engineer and I approve this video. Sound information!
5845,qs2QcycggWU,My brain hurts.
5846,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Video explaining a hard topic with lots of details very clearly and passionate about understanding.
5847,qs2QcycggWU,excellent explanation of so many hard to understand concepts in one minute. This video has the potential to be part of undergrad syllabus!!
5848,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredible stuff, very well explained. I lost my mind every time I encounter electronic signals and communication"
5849,qs2QcycggWU,Mind boggling! 👁️ Still can't belive how far we humans have come.
5850,qs2QcycggWU,I think even musk didn't know this much depth knowledge about this....  You are great... Not only for your knowledge also for best explanation with avatar-y animations

5855,qs2QcycggWU,background music way to loud! 😩
5856,qs2QcycggWU,"I am happy to find such YouTube channel. 
I work on similar domain. Yet your video helped me a lot. Detailing is great too."
5857,qs2QcycggWU,amazing
5858,qs2QcycggWU,I can weld that
5859,qs2QcycggWU,Long time ago tv dishes moved by changing channels
5860,qs2QcycggWU,"Well-made presentation and animations, I have an EE degree and work on MRI scanners, this video made sense to me. What is impressive is how Starlink is employing phased array; magnificent work by the Starlink researchers, developers and chip makers. BRAVO!"
5861,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm mind bown with this video and the engineers of Starlink, I appreciate you all"
5862,qs2QcycggWU,make more videos like this one
5863,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is Blown to smithereens. now I Respect E.Musk More
5864,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
5865,qs2QcycggWU,They used Blender
5866,qs2QcycggWU,I love watching videos like this & testing my knowledge by pausing & attempting to answer some of your rhetorical questions. This was amazing to watch. This is why I love space because the technology & science employed is absolutely INSANE. I am in awe.
5867,qs2QcycggWU,WOW!!!
5868,qs2QcycggWU,I like the information I was laid out in this vide
5869,qs2QcycggWU,"Great, very thorough."
5870,qs2QcycggWU,"Can the Russian regime block reception?  Not likely, and that’s the good news."
5871,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for easy to understand video
5872,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video
5873,qs2QcycggWU,"Never seen a video request the viewer to zip thru it at various speeds!!


To me it’s like saying this movie has been adapted to your TV screen size—how do they know what screen size I have?

Similarly, how do they know viewer’s cognitive absorptive capacity?

More could be said but that’s sufficient.

PS [Difficult to edit] The backstory is also fascinating: time to produce, original length, revisions, research, omissions, etc. Fascinating!"
5874,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!!
5875,qs2QcycggWU,yeaah... I'm first from Indonesian
5876,qs2QcycggWU,Really cool video.
5877,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible
5878,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video! Very informative
5879,qs2QcycggWU,🙏Thank You.
5880,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm impressed by your work. 
But you must add the translation to Arabic"
5881,qs2QcycggWU,anyone knows why 120 wavelengths represents only 6 bits? the wavelengths are somehow duplicated to verify error checking or something like that?
5882,qs2QcycggWU,"brilliant explanation, I wish my engineering college teachers were able to teach technology this way"
5883,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm sitting here stunned by how well I learned how this technology worked. I don't just know, but I actually understand how the 64 QAM encoding works and in general, how digital information is encoded and like... what it looks like. I'm stunned. This is an incredible presentation."
5884,qs2QcycggWU,"This is all thanks to the behavior of light. So if our communication system gives life to your devices then what electromagnetic frequency encompasses your conscious? Probably the sun. Entanglement could be Entangled mind. You could really be in two places at once. As a wave in the corona of the sun and as a particle, which is partial, here on the earth."
5885,qs2QcycggWU,"Hold onto that! I don't know if you have a background in STEM but if not, this is a very strong indicator of your inclination towards it."
5886,qs2QcycggWU,Hi
5887,qs2QcycggWU,Holey Moon Rocks! What a busy Dishy!
5888,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much for the effort to make these videos!
5889,qs2QcycggWU,"Around 9:00
Quick question:
AFAIK A magnetic field is induced by the Current and not Potential. So you either have a current and a magnetic field or no magnetic field and a charge potential. Both forming together a wave with the energy transmitted oscillating between the magnetic field and the electric field if recorded at one point in space over time. It is basically the same as an RLC oscillator with the energy oscillating between the capacitor and the inductor but the capacitor and the inductor are so to speak ""in the air""."
5890,qs2QcycggWU,"The word is ""Data"" not ""dada""."
5891,qs2QcycggWU,"Good explanation of beam steering by phased array. Also interesting to see how the individual antenna elements work, I had some inkling of these technologies but now I know quite a bit more."
5892,qs2QcycggWU,Love how detailed the video is!
5893,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing
5894,qs2QcycggWU,- great video!
5895,qs2QcycggWU,I feel like I got a discount buying Dishy after watching this video! :)
5896,qs2QcycggWU,What an astonishingly good video
5897,qs2QcycggWU,Very explainative. Bravo !
5898,qs2QcycggWU,Human salt at its best 👏
5899,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome as always!!
5900,qs2QcycggWU,*Saul Goodman brother will hate this* 😎
5901,qs2QcycggWU,❤️❤️🥇🥇
5902,qs2QcycggWU,"As a Starlink user I really enjoyed this video's explanation of Starlink at a much deeper level than a typical consumer oriented video might do, but yet it still remains accessible to us non-engineering folks.  The only piece I was waiting for that wasn't included was how the satellite network connects to the internet backbone.  Presumably Starlink maintains strategically located terrestrial stations for this purpose."
5903,qs2QcycggWU,"StarLinks require a large number of ground stations to function.  The low orbit of the satellites gives each satellite a vary limited transmission range.  The ground stations, about 140 miles to any side of it. Signal quality toward the edges of that range will also suffer, due to the signal traveling through more atmosphere. 

They have some plans to correct for this by allowing the stalites to talk with each other via laser transmission,  but that doesn't seem to have made it past the test phase yet."
5904,qs2QcycggWU,"Perfectly demonstrated, Thanks so much for the effort you put in in order to educate us! Brilliant."
5905,qs2QcycggWU,Knowledge is running to and fro..:❤️
5906,qs2QcycggWU,Wow 😲
5907,qs2QcycggWU,Love this video!
5908,qs2QcycggWU,holy crap...
5909,qs2QcycggWU,How does one starlink satellite beam form to many dishy mcflatfaces simultaneously?
5910,qs2QcycggWU,"AMAZING
LOC 2 the BONE"
5911,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! That is a great explanation! Love this content. 
Now I'm wondering, since Dishy is doing alone all the math and engineering of targeting the satellite, how is it possible for the satellite to do the same thing, multiplied by 100 or 1000, or whatever the number of Dishys it serves at a particular moment? Especially since the satellite is doing 90% of the emitting and Dishy only 10%. Is there a max number of Dishys a satellite can serve? 
It most definitely knows the coordinates of each of the Dishys in range. It probably has way more than 2500 mini dishes on board, and I guess at a given moment, 5% talk to Dishy1, 5% to Dishy2 and so on.
Glad there are smart people in this world doing this."
5912,qs2QcycggWU,You should cover the Starlink v2 satellites with laser links.
5913,qs2QcycggWU,"Gerek animasyon, gerek konuşma, gerek seslendirme, gerek tasarım; Mükemmel olmuş"
5914,qs2QcycggWU,Insanely good... Mind blown.. loved the detailed explanation for a normal person
5915,qs2QcycggWU,"very nice that you cover phased array and then you say each starlink satellite has 4 antennae .... hmmm .... Musk probably want there to be million of starlink customers down there so ..... how will the satellites cope with that? How many satellites will musk have to send up in reality? Is there something they are not talking about?
When everything is launched will bandwith go down in the end cause of load?"
5916,qs2QcycggWU,I WILL RESURRECT KOBE BRYANT.
5917,qs2QcycggWU,I'm gonna teach myself and my friends to send and receive electromagnetic waves using our brains
5918,qs2QcycggWU,My brain grew today
5919,qs2QcycggWU,Branch education coming through with top tier animations
5920,qs2QcycggWU,W phase shift beam steerinh
5921,qs2QcycggWU,I love these videos I'm going to comment 10 times
5922,qs2QcycggWU,I AM THE PROFESSOR OF STRING THEORY.
5923,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing honestly
5924,qs2QcycggWU,"I have watched many tech explanations but no-one is even closer to your's... Your Explanations are really OSM🤩💪🏻... Especially this one thrilled my mind... Being from Electronics, I can relate many things from your videos and your video's clarify many of my doubts... Keep Uploading such videos 💪🏻"
5925,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks to this technology we will have more people interested in this kind of content. As elon said this will aid with expanding the scope of conciseness.
5926,qs2QcycggWU,You say kilometers like everybody knows what you mean what is that in miles per hour or miles
5927,qs2QcycggWU,More Physik`s  :)
5928,qs2QcycggWU,An amazing video. Thanks to everyone who produces these
5929,qs2QcycggWU,Nice video! Keep the good work.
5930,qs2QcycggWU,"""we recommend watching it first at 1.25x speed and a second time at 1.5x speed""

So hang on, does this mean that if I normally watch videos at 1.5x speed anyway I should be watching this one at 1.75x speed the first time around, then 2x speed the second time around??"
5931,qs2QcycggWU,Verry impressive clear video !
5932,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for providing the world with eye opening and well described animated technologies. One can only imagine the future ! Thank you !
5933,qs2QcycggWU,is this an advertisement?
5934,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow. This was an exceptional explanation of how this all works.  I love that you don’t shy away from the math/engineering but keep it at a high level.  

Thanks for your hard work to make topics like these digestible by many people."
5935,qs2QcycggWU,Elon Musk is an Alien 🤯
5936,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!
5937,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Video
5938,qs2QcycggWU,Make the 45 minute video!!
5939,qs2QcycggWU,good explanation!!
5940,qs2QcycggWU,This is an amazing visual and auditory Wikipedia page. Great work!
5941,qs2QcycggWU,Magic and sorcery for sure :)
5942,qs2QcycggWU,Mind Blown!  (Comment added BEFORE the “if your mind. . .”).
5943,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for making this video. Love your content!
5944,qs2QcycggWU,Such a detailed video. Hats off to you for all the hard work
5945,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is the only reason I'm not leaving YouTube. The quality of the content is superb and visuals are unmatched.
5946,qs2QcycggWU,Hello from Starlink space
5947,qs2QcycggWU,wow. such a deep physics oriented video. I am engineering student but still can't comprehend how details this video. OMG.
5948,qs2QcycggWU,This channel might be the very best one to take off in the last few years
5949,qs2QcycggWU,excellent
5950,qs2QcycggWU,5G?  AAAAAAAAAA  [running around in panic]
5951,qs2QcycggWU,good endeavor but so many mistakes and wrong explanations... facepalm
5952,qs2QcycggWU,I love this information about how Starlink User Terminals work! Thank you so much for putting out.
5953,qs2QcycggWU,"I am not sure how you worked so dilegently for so long on one script.. but wow I am glad you did. What a pricese explanation. All universtiy students of EMC and Radio comunications need to watch this video several times. 
Were you doing a PHD thesis this would be 50% of your doctorate!"
5954,qs2QcycggWU,simply thankyou
5955,qs2QcycggWU,Kemey ke selam do
5956,qs2QcycggWU,"It doesn't... None of it exists as you think..

There are no satellites from star link. Balloons are used to keep ""satellites"" up for a small period of time..

Why do you think mobile towers have been popping up at alarming rates? 

This is all smoke and mirrors...

Question everything for yourself people and you will start your journey to waking up... 

One might wonder where the billions of dollars actually go..... I assure you it's not in star link BS satellites.

This is all fraudulent.. spend time doing your own research and you will soon find out..

This nonsense is designed for a couple reasons.. primarily to make you believe you are completely irrelevant and just a fluke... I won't get into the why. But look around and you can see.

God is much closer than you think........"
5957,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant!
5958,qs2QcycggWU,Perfection!
5959,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic video... Thank you
5960,qs2QcycggWU,Your work is insanely cool! Keep going with it!
5961,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. I am blow away with the amount of technology that goes in this Starlink internet platform. Thank you so such a detailed video and understanding plus the animation was cherry on the cake. Thank you so much for the information and the content.
5962,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, so much research. Well done!"
5963,qs2QcycggWU,"Exactly  the same as the other satellite internet services, but because Elon is an idiot his system requires thousands of satellites which need replacing every few years whereas the other systems manage global coverage with just 3 satellites. StarLink will be another failure"
5964,qs2QcycggWU,"Video is mind-blowing. The quality of animation, the narrative, level of details. All are higher than A+. I rarely subscribe, but I did for more videos like this"
5965,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful. This video has enriched many concepts. Great work by the creator
5966,qs2QcycggWU,"13:08 looks more like 5000 x, not 1280 x"
5967,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome
5968,qs2QcycggWU,So cool and mind blowing!
5969,qs2QcycggWU,"I am do IT work for a living and this literally blew my mind.  This was very well done and for me, it could have been dumbed down a bit more.  You did an exceptional job on the visuals and explaning of details. Kudos to all who work on this. Color me very impressed."
5970,qs2QcycggWU,"Goddam I can’t express how much better this video explains things compared to boring lectures, I just don’t know much about the feasibility of this technology since I’m quite ignorant about this topic but.
How costly is this technology?
How many satellites does this need to work worldwide?
How do you avoid those satellites from crashing into each other?"
5971,qs2QcycggWU,"One of the greatest video I saw, I think it took ages to create such precise animations💪🏼💪🏼"
5972,qs2QcycggWU,"How do they deal with red shift and blueshift due to high velocity movement, earth rotation, and gravitational well?"
5973,qs2QcycggWU,"I must say I never subscribe to many  channels but I just had to like and subscribe to your channel 😉 
Please make many more videos."
5974,qs2QcycggWU,How have I not been recommended this channel sooner. Instant sub great work.
5975,qs2QcycggWU,wow so complicated
5976,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, that is an excellent explanation and the technology used is mind blowing. Few questions from my end -

Question 1: How do these EM waves does not interfere with other Dishy placed nearby each other? I mean how is my Dishy is recognized a separate entity from my neighbor's Dishy (which is placed literally 2 feet away from my Dishy) ? 

Question 2: Also, how does my data is safe from lets say hackers when it travels through space in the form of EM waves ?

Question 3: Will these orbiting satellites be able to handle millions (billions) of Dishy requests in future?

I love your channel and all other videos (especially SSD one) <3"
5977,qs2QcycggWU,Great work..
5978,qs2QcycggWU,"Watching on starlink rn! Getting crazy speeds out in a rural area. About 150mps. 

Got 20kbs over mobile data before in the same area."
5979,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. Mind blown. Both dishy's technology and your video explaining it. Seriously. Just wow.
5980,qs2QcycggWU,"so what your saying is ""RF is black magic""...... ya i agree"
5981,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks.
5982,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.
5983,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done.
5984,qs2QcycggWU,I think what you do is awesome
5985,qs2QcycggWU,Phenomenal production and explanations!
5986,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome blew my mind hats off to the creators, scripters and simple explanation"
5987,qs2QcycggWU,My head hurts
5988,qs2QcycggWU,I just want to see a satellite in space why all this crap
5989,qs2QcycggWU,"It absolutely blows my mind I can watch this for free, thank you."
5990,qs2QcycggWU,"What a high quality content! You're making this whole world smarter and our future brighter! I am glad that kids these days can find something like this, thank you"
5991,qs2QcycggWU,Great video!
5992,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent explanation!
5993,qs2QcycggWU,The old dish satellites don't move relative to the ground.  They are non-geosynchronous.  I am sure the author knows this but yet the animation shows the opposite.
5994,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing stuff. Great work. So many new concepts I never knew about
5995,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent! Beautiful clear graphics.
5996,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the hard work on your videos.
5997,qs2QcycggWU,"Good Lord, Elon, and alllllll them other folks are smart AF! Dishy does all that so 3 people in the house can play PlayStation, and 2 can watch Netflix/Porn? Thank you geniuses."
5998,qs2QcycggWU,"This is so amazing, thanks for sharing this information in an understandable way."
5999,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing high quality video!
6000,qs2QcycggWU,"I learn more in this smart people sharing their knowledge and experties in internet for the benefit of those under priveledge individual who don't have a capacity to pay university. I appreciate all your kindness to save humanity from draining information from the world they know nothing about. This is an example of life changing to explore the other mysteries of unseen power of EMF, electricity and the technology that control it. Again thank you for this amazing animation that help us to graps it in simplest way."
6001,qs2QcycggWU,Great explination. Thanks
6002,qs2QcycggWU,Cap off to your team that;s produced this presentation. Quite incredible for me personaly. Phased Array. wow.
6003,qs2QcycggWU,I  am a electrician and at least been to some college this is the best shit I’ve seen good 👍 job thanks
6004,qs2QcycggWU,"""The longer explanation requires a ton of math and physics"" Yes! ""So let's skip it ."" Booo!"
6005,qs2QcycggWU,Oh wow this was so cool I like fpv drones and this put a lot of knowledge into my brain
6006,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! very detailed and in a clear English! I managed to see it in 3x and I understood everything. Thanks !
6007,qs2QcycggWU,I counted 25 shooting stars!
6008,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent explainer video for an interesting and current topic.

As others have pointed out, this is reminiscent of (if not superior to) the old Discovery Channel programs that I grew up with, before it went downhill. You've definitely got my attention."
6009,qs2QcycggWU,20 ms latency being critical for surfing web? All I needed to hear.
6010,qs2QcycggWU,This video is extremely well made and very easy to understand! Thank you
6011,qs2QcycggWU,I'd love a second video on the satellite. Can't wait till it comes out.
6012,qs2QcycggWU,"Subscribed, Liked and now commenting because I really appreciate the effort that went into the research, scripting, explanation and video editing that went into this video! Thank you!"
6013,qs2QcycggWU,You pay $110/month and $700 and equipment-costs for standard internet.
6014,qs2QcycggWU,There are few channels I get this giddy to see upload! Always love the content!!!
6015,qs2QcycggWU,"The dish is said to get very hot and it's dangerous to approach it while it's in operation (radiation).  Also, the costs of the service make it a less attractive option for anyone with other, cheaper alternatives. Especially in Canada, which seems to be getting price-gouged by Starlink!"
6016,qs2QcycggWU,unbeliveable
6017,qs2QcycggWU,this video is totally nuts!!!!!! AWSOME!!!!
6018,qs2QcycggWU,This is THE best video I have ever seen free on the internet. Thanks :)
6019,qs2QcycggWU,"Ja, endlich versteht man eigenartigen Scheiben"
6020,qs2QcycggWU,wow
6021,qs2QcycggWU,"I still wonder how dedicated humans can be to a single video.
Keep up the very good work😁."
6022,qs2QcycggWU,nice
6023,qs2QcycggWU,What a video man wholly molly
6024,qs2QcycggWU,best educational video ever!!!!
6025,qs2QcycggWU,Hexagon is bestagon.
6026,qs2QcycggWU,"Definitely create more videos like this one ,it was very detailed and informative, I could say it on par with discovery Channel TV quality 👌"
6027,qs2QcycggWU,mindblown
6028,qs2QcycggWU,This was an excellent video that I happened to stumble across. This may be my newest favorite channel!
6029,qs2QcycggWU,"Tanks to my audiophile phase, this was sooo easy to understand :))"
6030,qs2QcycggWU,"Poetic, Theoretic explaination of Starlink internet technology. I liked the video even though I don't understand every part of it. Please make more videos about telecomm sector. LoraWan network maybe."
6031,qs2QcycggWU,This is a really great video. Well explained mindblowing sacience.
6032,qs2QcycggWU,"As a retired Navy engineer this was very informative and interesting. I worked on phased array 3D radar, so this was not entirely new. Although the technology is very advanced from my work in the 1980's, the basics are the same. This was done in such a professional manner with super graphics that one run through pretty much brought me up to speed. Super job, folks."
6033,qs2QcycggWU,"Ayy, SPY fam?"
6034,qs2QcycggWU,AN/SPS 48 mostly!
6035,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball I feel happy to classify that as ""SPY extended fam"". 80s, so that's NTU-era deployment of the 48 yeah?"
6036,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, that was my later years. I retired in '84. I started out on 55b tracking radar, but quickly saw that opting for a different school would be a good Idea. I went 48 while it was still young, about 1966, and then kept up with all the schools on the radar until my retirement. I was lucky to stay either a technician, or teacher, until the very end of my career when I made E8."
6037,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball So are we FC fam then, though? All my schools were in Dahlgren, and though that's mostly AEGIS central, iirc there were a couple of non-Aegis schools there. Feel like maybe something 48 adjacent was one of them. Something SSDS related maybe, idk."
6038,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball You're probably typing it but looking up the 55, that was definitely ET gear, so I'm guessing it's maybe less likely that you were reclassed to FC and more likely that your 48 tech billets were for ETs at the time, and then you went to teach?"
6039,qs2QcycggWU,"You're thinking of the SPS55, a short range surface search radar. I meant the 55B tracking radar associated with the Terrier missile system, which is maintained by missile FT's."
6040,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mm8ball Ah! Okay so you would be an FC, in current ratings. IIRC (and as you probably know) FT generally merged with FC, except I think some NECs would have become GMs iirc. Anyhow my very first NEC before branching out was 1143."
6041,qs2QcycggWU,"​@@mm8ball (Second reply:) If 1143 isn't easily meaningful for you -- I am literally you + one gen! 1143s own the illuminators (designation AN/SPG-62) plus their respective transmitters and FCS computers on Aegis ships.

Oh. Also at some point TPTB dumped ORTS into 1143 as well, bc on early BL Aegis, ORTS ran on a computer of the same kind as the ones that run FCS. (Specifically, UYK-44's.) For whatever reason they / we were not assigned the 44's that, at certain times as BLs evolved and stuff upgraded, were also present. 

Also also, 1143 techs going for ESWS early on may relate to this: Becoming unexpectedly helpful to VLS-type GM or STG friends, upon realizing their troublesome casualty or fault was on equipment they owned that was essentially identical to equipment we owned, but that they had relatively inferior training on. Not complaining that I didn't also own two more 44's as a brand new E-4, just pointing out an absurdity from that era, haha."
6042,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 I'm even older than that! I think I mentioned that I retired in 1984. I was in for almost exactly 20 years. In 1964 I went to my first school, the Mk119 computer. It used gears, resolvers, and many other unknowable doodads to compute lead angle for the launcher, and other parameters needed to track targets. I shipped over in order to get a different job, and was kind of forced into going to school for the tracking radar (the heart of the Terrier system.) By the time I had two years in I had all the schools in the Terrier FCS. Very unusual, but it worked for me."
6043,qs2QcycggWU,Navy RADAR. We needed a whole room of equipment to do the same thing.
6044,qs2QcycggWU,"So it works as i wuld have thought more or less. I meant phase shifting to direct beam, but to design and build PCB, amplifiers that works on 12GHZ, this is astonishing for me."
6045,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for this video!!
6046,qs2QcycggWU,"Extremely well made video!
I just havent understood yet, how they are able to modify the bits sent by changing the phase while also using the phase change to move the beam in the desired direction.
How can the phase change be used for 2 different applications?"
6047,qs2QcycggWU,"Network engineer here, with a physics background. 

Refreshing to see an accurate, techy video that breaks down so much of the system. 

It's a rabbit hole of information but you managed to cover everything in enough detail to introduce it, while allowing the audience to choose whether they want to go further into the rabbit hole. 

Many of the techniques used by starlink are used in your home WiFi, or other systems you're familiar with. Starlink brings a lot of things together (including Elons infinite wallet) in a way that hasn't been done before."
6048,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!!  I appreciate it.  Yeah- I like to think of it as supplements to courses that could fit in any 11th / 12th-grade science curriculum, and really expose students to engineering."
6049,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation bro you are a genius please make a video on how to make my wife touch me
6050,qs2QcycggWU,Like kessler syndrome?
6051,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool
6052,qs2QcycggWU,i wonder if in the future this Starlink will be able to takeover all our telco services :D
6053,qs2QcycggWU,"​@@Chryeon - Technically yes, but in terms of cost and capacity, probably not.  And that's ok, there are plenty of lower cost terrestrial internet providers with even higher speeds and lower latency, but those who travel a lot especially in places with little to no internet service, Starlink is a great option."
6054,qs2QcycggWU,"That's correct. Beamforming/band steering has been used since 802.11ac WiFi around 10 years ago. Likewise, 64 QAM mentioned in the video was used in 802.11n WiFi around 15 years ago. Starlink is still very impressive technology when you consider the distances, throughput and a fast moving ""target"". Given that we are currently at 1024 QAM in ax routers (and will soon be a lot higher), it will be interesting to see if this makes its way to newer Starlink satellites to increase throughput further."
6055,qs2QcycggWU,👍
6056,qs2QcycggWU,How far from earth are the satelites? So bad they don't tell
6057,qs2QcycggWU,More expensive shittier internet genius
6058,qs2QcycggWU,👌👌👌👌
6059,qs2QcycggWU,I love those videos ! Keep the good work :)
6060,qs2QcycggWU,"Truly incredible technology. I am always a bit terrified each day of how much there is to know and understand out there, and know I’ll never grasp it all. In any case, videos like yours make me feel a little better and smarter than before. Thank you."
6061,qs2QcycggWU,Perfection
6062,qs2QcycggWU,"24:30 is he describing QAM64?
25:45 Sorry....."
6063,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, i was blown away a bout the amount of information and production quality. You have my comment, like and subscribe.
Thank you."
6064,qs2QcycggWU,"God, I love technology."
6065,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question why wouldn't disturbances, obstructions and other local environmental factors like rain,fog not affect the transmissions?!"
6066,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow what a good video! Thank you!

Random note to everyone: TV satellites actually rotate with the earth (geosynchronous orbit, no need to hop satellites). The image shows them spinning around the earth but they actually stay in place relatively speaking around the equator."
6067,qs2QcycggWU,"How many eyes, arms àñd légs do earthlings hàvé. I think the females also have a  orifice  that broadcasts gibberish to males so long às male wíll  strand  for for it..She nas spell on him. Calß sex. imprisonment until  he coopérates until"
6068,qs2QcycggWU,.
6069,qs2QcycggWU,"Will weather conditions affect the connection, like say, cloudy? And how strong are these waves, Can it pass through buildings? And can data be stolen somehow in between? I guess there should be encryption, nvm."
6070,qs2QcycggWU,This is such a detailed and informative video! Also love the fact that it doesn’t seem boring at any moment. But there’s one thing that I wonder: why don’t they transmit and accept data at the same time? Could they use different antennas with different frequency bands to transmit and accept data at the same time? Or is it just too costly?
6071,qs2QcycggWU,"Much appreciated.   Yes, it really comes down to cost."
6072,qs2QcycggWU,"yes, but more specifically, no. I believe starlink uses what's called PESA, which is one transmitter/receiver controlling every antenna on the array, and using the array the steer the beam. This is how it tracks the satellite so precisely. An AESA, which is found on modern military aircraft as a radar, has a separate transceiver for every single antenna, and can broadcast and receive many different frequencies at the same time, which as you can imagine is very complex. Starlink might be using something a little more sophisticated than PESA to let it broadcast a few frequencies at once, but I'm not sure. But what you're thinking of is AESA and it's very advanced and expensive"
6073,qs2QcycggWU,@@moonasha thanks for the additional info!
6074,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation Perhaps the two broadcasts would interfere with each other if they were to be used at the same time, polluting the medium and distorting the message content. Loved the video!"
6075,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video!!! But, how can one satellite support multiple dishies?"
6076,qs2QcycggWU,This is absolutely brilliant. Great work 👏 👏 👏
6077,qs2QcycggWU,An excellent description of some very cool technology.
6078,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing Explanation...
6079,qs2QcycggWU,By far one of the best channels on YT!
6080,qs2QcycggWU,"You mentioned the patches are around 1400 in number but then in later discussion and animations the number is 1280, why is that?"
6081,qs2QcycggWU,"How does the network handle congestion and airtime.  Is it TDMA (Time  Division Multiple Access), CDMA (code division multiple access) or most likely FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple access)?"
6082,qs2QcycggWU,"Do starlink dishes use Forward Error Correction (FEC)?  If so, is it known what the coding scheme is?"
6083,qs2QcycggWU,No one has or uses starlink internet. This is a joke right? The satellite dish on your roof goe to a ground based tower. Haha ask a technician
6084,qs2QcycggWU,Great work.
6085,qs2QcycggWU,"Super invincible. Especially your dubbing like Star Trek, or the dubbing of the home game. Thank you very much for your work."
6086,qs2QcycggWU,Totally Impressed. No words. This is the way to convey the knowledge . Super simplified the complexity and yet interesting than watching a si-fi mmovies
6087,qs2QcycggWU,great educational video!
6088,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video
6089,qs2QcycggWU,It does not. NEXT!
6090,qs2QcycggWU,"This was an absolute brilliant production.  MSM outlets are going to die.  Hulu is making some of the best serialized television today.  Letterkenny was started on YouTube, incredible!  Great job y'all"
6091,qs2QcycggWU,😢😢Then we have to wear aluminium foil hats to protect our brain🤪🤪 from wavelengths. 🤣🤣
6092,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah do you know what stuff we all had a couple cross but all those fucked satellites and low orbit from artella scopes it's like we don't like to see those lines
6093,qs2QcycggWU,such an informative video..thanku🙂
6094,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video!
6095,qs2QcycggWU,👍
6096,qs2QcycggWU,"not rich enough to pay u guys by any means i will do my part of support by liking and commenting thank you 
this is actually a great content"
6097,qs2QcycggWU,Love this vid!
6098,qs2QcycggWU,"amazinngg! cool research! ,3"
6099,qs2QcycggWU,This was a great video! As a computer engineer I was honestly curious how this technology works
6100,qs2QcycggWU,"Does the satellite need to distribute the 540 Mbits between all its users, and if not, how?"
6101,qs2QcycggWU,That was very interesting and I think very well explained with my intermediate knowledge of technology.
6102,qs2QcycggWU,"fantastic content, thanks!"
6103,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant!
6104,qs2QcycggWU,Isn't it kind of dangerous for all the people in airplanes if there are tons of microwave lasers zapping through them all the time? Honest question.
6105,qs2QcycggWU,"What happens when, during the shifting time in the 100 degrees aperture (for example from left to right), someone is sending data? Are they buffered in a memory on the dishy side? 
How long it takes to take on the incoming satellite from the previous one? How data beams are handled during that time?"
6106,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is a goldmine
6107,qs2QcycggWU,I would love to see what happens after the signal gets to the satellite!
6108,qs2QcycggWU,"Super Cool!  Would be interesting if you could have given a brief reference to how Starlink satellites ""talk"" with one another.  Once the satellite talking with Dishy is out of range, the conversation somehow gets passed to another satellite?  Finally, what is the physical size of Dishy?  Thanks for this video.  I might have pursued engineering had these kind of videos been available back when I was a kid."
6109,qs2QcycggWU,"Actually I understood some concepts from this video deeper than I did before!!!!
Absolutely mind blowing tech!"
6110,qs2QcycggWU,Great stuff!
6111,qs2QcycggWU,OK just give me explanation about that. For that beam change I use Phase Shift OK but for different data I use again Phase Shift so how Im able to transmitt data during that beam change becose first is affecting second. Thank you.
6112,qs2QcycggWU,mind blowing
6113,qs2QcycggWU,The technology is very impressive! Thank you for making such a high quality educational video!
6114,qs2QcycggWU,Wow cool
6115,qs2QcycggWU,It doesn't work though!
6116,qs2QcycggWU,How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work? The satellites hang from balloons.
6117,qs2QcycggWU,No wonder Electrical Engineering is considered to be an alien tech knowledge;)
6118,qs2QcycggWU,By whom?
6119,qs2QcycggWU,"@@tgstudio85 many, who are aware of, that science of electricity and magnetism give them basis for marveling miracles in the field of engineering. 
eg, try thinking TELEvision or TELEphone being practically possible without the pioneering application of electrical engineering."
6120,qs2QcycggWU,How on Earth did you make this video??
6121,qs2QcycggWU,"A great video, thank you so much!"
6122,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
6123,qs2QcycggWU,"Most of this is basic electronics.  Also, television satellites are in geosynchronous orbits... they're always in the same spots in the sky from our point of view."
6124,qs2QcycggWU,"I use to just  dream  this kinds of high quality education info with such clean animation. And yes this is here … 

Thank you so much creater. 
Thank you so much YouTube. 
Thank you so much my universe ❤️"
6125,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best channel and videos i've ever watched in my entire life. Mind blowing 3D modeling and explanation. Keep on going.
6126,qs2QcycggWU,They were like Elon what ya ohh do last night and he was like I figured it out and they were like figured out what and he was like time travel.....
6127,qs2QcycggWU,"22:13 I subscribed, clicked the like button, and wrote a Comment.
Looking forward to more videos like this one, you're awsome! :D"
6128,qs2QcycggWU,Anybody watching this over Starlink?
6129,qs2QcycggWU,I watch Youtube at 4x most of the time.
6130,qs2QcycggWU,"Can't believe got this kind of knowledge for free, hitting like and subscribe will become a must for me"
6131,qs2QcycggWU,"My word. First video, and I love the format. Liked, subscribed and enthused."
6132,qs2QcycggWU,"😂😂

A. Kessler Syndrome. 
B. Hyperloop
C.Pedophile cave rescue submarine.
D. Self driving cars.

Elons a fraud.."
6133,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you so much for explaining this to us! 🤯
6134,qs2QcycggWU,"Will ""Dishy"" and the satellite be hardened against an EMP?"
6135,qs2QcycggWU,"Wonderful video. I love how such amazingly complicated system, involving the work of thousands of PhDs, has been created so Joe Shmoe can watch a video with some idiot explaining about how the Earth is flat or the moon landings were faked."
6136,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the same technology as the fire control radars on interceptors like the F-14, F-16, F-18, F-22, and the F-35 which direct AAMRAM missiles to their target. This is also used in the planar radars on the Ticonderoga Class Cruisers. So now civilians are using a form of radar like steerable dishes for internet reception. How antiquated !"
6137,qs2QcycggWU,this is awesome bro thankyou for this contest it so good
6138,qs2QcycggWU,very very informative
6139,qs2QcycggWU,Simply mind blowing
6140,qs2QcycggWU,"Is there a tutorial ""How to breed like Elon Musk"" on Brilliant website?"
6141,qs2QcycggWU,"Definitely not by painting the reflective panels on the satellites black

That might cause a bit of heat issues

Just saying, Elon"
6142,qs2QcycggWU,This is driving me nuts.  I'm outta here.   🤪
6143,qs2QcycggWU,"I think I heard this guy on one of those Cold Case, Forensic Files shows."
6144,qs2QcycggWU,Great content 👍🏽
6145,qs2QcycggWU,"I wonder which is more impressive, complex, and difficult: the Starlink technology or the technique to make this video?"
6146,qs2QcycggWU,"Great more junk to polite Earth's orbit  it will ruin our beautiful view of the sky. All to spy on us or watch a stupid movie full of propaganda. Wow I'm so proud of what talking, not thinking apes can accomplish. So are they just gonna zap you if they feel like it because you didn't comb your hair right that morning. Must be Besos I deal"
6147,qs2QcycggWU,suggestion: please get rid of the background music which makes it more difficult to hear particularly among many people who are neurologically challenged when there is noise in the background. This makes it almost impossible for me to watch more than five or 10 minutes of this video at a time before I start feeling anxious. I doubt whether anybody would miss this music and although it seems to be Common place to have background music I dealt with anyone else would actually miss it. Please help.
6148,qs2QcycggWU,And eventually you find some idiot uses this great engineering to simply watch porn videos 😂😂
6149,qs2QcycggWU,I leaned something new today phased array steering
6150,qs2QcycggWU,Superb

6155,qs2QcycggWU,You visualize my dreams so well!
6156,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
6157,qs2QcycggWU,How is the satellite able to receive the message given that there can be multiple Dishy satellites transmitting at once to the satellite?
6158,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for this video great work
6159,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, my mind was blown"
6160,qs2QcycggWU,So much information in one video! Thanks branch education creators!
6161,qs2QcycggWU,"Pls do more and more videos like this..
It'll help an ordinary person like me to at least know atleast the name of these kind of technological marvels..
You've rocked it..👏🏽👏🏽"
6162,qs2QcycggWU,this is why we have a chip shortage lol also highly appreciate the 1.25x speed!
6163,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. New sub here.
6164,qs2QcycggWU,love this

🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Plus the entire video is like seven minutes long at this speed😂 so counting shooting stars during the video is a little easier💫✨"
6168,qs2QcycggWU,woww
6169,qs2QcycggWU,Life is short.. playback at 2x
6170,qs2QcycggWU,Satellites are hoax
6171,qs2QcycggWU,"If they are a hoax kiddo, why do they work?"
6172,qs2QcycggWU,absolutely fucked my mind bruv
6173,qs2QcycggWU,Will it be slowing down in cloudy weather?
6174,qs2QcycggWU,"Very Good detail and animation.  Very professional.  Would like to see followup on other components within total data stream:  phase time failover to new satalite (due to shift out of range or due to inteference where it has better path/option)  handling of weather,  theoretical load within total recive range of single sattalite and how that shifts when all four statlite phase units can move to receive and direct all outbound over laser to hub Gen 2 starlink units"
6175,qs2QcycggWU,I need to sleep after watching this.
6176,qs2QcycggWU,Loveeeeeeeee this. Make more❤️❤️❤️
6177,qs2QcycggWU,That is crazy how much tech there is in these dishes.
6178,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video.  Thanks!!
6179,qs2QcycggWU,Space is pure HOAX...earth is flat...enough is enough.....
6180,qs2QcycggWU,"If asked:
I'll just say ""it is phase arrayed"" and then try not to smirk."
6181,qs2QcycggWU,I  love how something so complicated is called dishy mcflatface
6182,qs2QcycggWU,Also video like these let you know how far the human mind has come
6183,qs2QcycggWU,"This INCREDIBLY long video can be summarized in four words: large, airborne 5G network."
6184,qs2QcycggWU,I live in Montana I drove to the middle of nowhere which took me about 5 minutes. Went to see the meteor shower
6185,qs2QcycggWU,Great video I am new sub  please make a lot more  hire more people if you have to because it a lot of work but we need Content like this
6186,qs2QcycggWU,Overpriced and won't work under heavy load. Good if you're in a very remote part of the globe though but I prefer my low latency 5gbit down 1gbit up glass fiber that can do way more if I ever need it.
6187,qs2QcycggWU,"Great technology But VERY EXPENSIVE! NOT WORTH IT IN MY COUNTRY IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. First, it was worth DOP 7,080 (133.21USD) a month this does not account for the additional fees of buying the equipment which is + another (500.00 USD) plus shipping fees that's (60.00 USD). They don't understand that in these third-world countries people don't make that much to afford not just the monthly plan (D.R. $2,900 DOP) but the cost of buying the equipment and also paying another (100 USD) if you decide to move to another location in the same state, the country city, I believe that once Elon Musk and star link understand this and make it much more affordable they will succeed in being the number one worldwide internet provider around the world, I believe that an affordable well, not an affordable but for now a reasonable price tag and competitive would be 1# for the equipment anywhere from (150 USD to 200 USD) for third world countries and with options of different monthly price plans instead of just one that can range from (30 USD) to (60 USD) and not charge (100 USD)  Fee for changing location not at all if it's in the same city  now if you go out to the country side and you have a farm that you like to visit ones in a few it would be great that insted of paying an aditional fee for chanbgin location and yo only go there mayb ones every other week it would be great if starlink and elon musk allows you to inste of paying a fee everytime you like to swicth  location that they allow you a one time fee to buy locations that you might go offten, with that said I believe that starlink would be an amazing option and would be the next Big thing as a comunication provider! Best of Luck and in GOD SPEED hope this may come true sooner than later, cheers!"
6188,qs2QcycggWU,This the most detailed how it’s made I ever seen
6189,qs2QcycggWU,"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Thank you SOOO much!!! Half an hour passed like 5 minutes, I swear!!! Greetings from Mendoza, Argentina!!!"
6190,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative just subscribed.  👍
6191,qs2QcycggWU,You can actually see these starlinks at yosemite night time
6192,qs2QcycggWU,"Second comment here...again loved the video. A question I have thought of many times (and my apologies if already answered somewhere), is how a satellite (i.e., StarLink, HughesNet, etc, ) receive countless user transmissions at the same time? They would have to be sharing frequencies, correct? Like HughsNet, millions of subscribers on one large satellite...how do they keep the many subscriber's data packets from interfering with each other?  For that fact, how do cell towers do this too?  This would make a great video for you guys."
6193,qs2QcycggWU,"Muy interesante, complejo y a la vez simplificado video. Me encantó, desearía poder entender más esto. Gracias por su dedicación y tiempo."
6194,qs2QcycggWU,Never thought something could be so interesting and boring at the same time I think my brain is melting down I'm going to have to take some shrooms and rewatch this to comprehend all of what's been said or at least tricking my brain to thinking it understands LOL.
6195,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this. I have a StarLink and am a fan. This video was fascinating.
6196,qs2QcycggWU,comment removed by branch eductaiojn way to go when i correct you guys you remove my comment real nice
6197,qs2QcycggWU,Seems like the dishy works in similar way as Active Phased Array Radar which is such a high technology. Hard to believe that those high technology is affordable and applied on civilian products right now. I just say wow.
6198,qs2QcycggWU,why don't they teach like this in school?
6199,qs2QcycggWU,🤯
6200,qs2QcycggWU,"That's the best explanation for many topic I didn't understand well until I saw your video specially for Antennas, Constructing coherent of waves,  Digital Modulation. Thank you."
6201,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
6202,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive work
6203,qs2QcycggWU,Thank youuu
6204,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant. More please
6205,qs2QcycggWU,"Can you please do a video from the other end ? Explaining the satellite , 
Thanks"
6206,qs2QcycggWU,Way over my head. Understood just a bit
6207,qs2QcycggWU,Really It's a great work. Thumbs up guys
6208,qs2QcycggWU,Another concern I have as future  customerflat dish  out the opening sound wonderful for a mother bird to make a nest  on  right there on top of all Nick pretty flat face that doesn’t happen the snow the rain will cause dirt intoD  Bree in short  will there be a dome over this flat dish to protect it from birds weather rain animals sticks and such
6209,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Wish I had this 20 years ago when I was learning about this stuff.
6210,qs2QcycggWU,I really admire people who invent all this
6211,qs2QcycggWU,I am incredibly impressed with the way you broke down this information. It was far more informative than I thought it would be going into it.
6212,qs2QcycggWU,It's a 24/7 world-wide surveillance system paid for by the tax payer to the tune of 260 billion$ (the amount Elon made in the last 2 years).
6213,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are really good! Got yourselves a subscriber!
6214,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent info, brilliant presentation !"
6215,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, and fckk my Gov. leaders . i am talking about iraq"
6216,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible.
6217,qs2QcycggWU,Well done!
6218,qs2QcycggWU,impressive!!!
6219,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you for making science accessible. This video is just absolutely, mind-bogglingly good. So very well explained."
6220,qs2QcycggWU,Woow! Excellent video
6221,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
6222,qs2QcycggWU,"ty m8s, well done"
6223,qs2QcycggWU,Interesting explanation of phased array antenna. Great job!
6224,qs2QcycggWU,thanks
6225,qs2QcycggWU,very well done!
6226,qs2QcycggWU,Great video! Animations are well done
6227,qs2QcycggWU,So cool..
6228,qs2QcycggWU,This is a fantastic explanation with an important level of detail that is left off so many other explanations. As an electrical engineer I could see this being useful in universities as an introduction to the topic to help give people a baseline understanding to build on. Great work 👍
6229,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for spending so much time on this topic! I watched a video where a student studying networking utilized wifi frequencies to make a rudimentary radar/lidar based on the same principle of phase shifting. This is super cool to see how it is used in commercial settings.
6230,qs2QcycggWU,"This is unbelievable, both the depth explanation and the tech itself. It's like learning some super advanced alien technology. I want to ask, how does one Starlink satellite communicate with multiple ground antennas?"
6231,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing! Lol
6232,qs2QcycggWU,Use of phase shifting for beam alignment is so smart.
6233,qs2QcycggWU,"Now that the wiring is complete the question is , who will control the global network ? We know that before the Christ returns a false messiah will partner with a religious leader to unify a global church and global currency. Government and religion under one leader . A body implant will monitor all economic activity and all human interactions.The leader will demand all to submit to his requirements or be deleted from the system.
If you submit to the govt. system of control, you will be cast into the lake of fire on judgement day."
6234,qs2QcycggWU,$100 per month and £600 hardware cost. Not a chance it will ever be profitable.
6235,qs2QcycggWU,Do you not know how much typical satellite internet cost?
6236,qs2QcycggWU,"@@user-RCST Didn't they say $100 000? Add to that launch, engineering, marketing and administration costs  It cant work."
6237,qs2QcycggWU,"Dishy mcflatface, elon musk is a master memesmith."
6238,qs2QcycggWU,What a good explanation of phased array beam forming! Great job! Good visualization!
6239,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, I watched it at 2.5x and got everything. Clear voice indeed."
6240,qs2QcycggWU,crazy!
6241,qs2QcycggWU,OMG ... Best explanation of the covered topics I have ever seen!
6242,qs2QcycggWU,"Now you can stream porn 24/7.
Thank you Elon for saving the planet."
6243,qs2QcycggWU,"Thaaannkkks man!
Love you!"
6244,qs2QcycggWU,Great video. Excellent graphics. And Starlink is amazing stuff.
6245,qs2QcycggWU,Sopa interesting
6246,qs2QcycggWU,Yes!
6247,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredibly fascinating technology described in incredibly friendly way. Also many thanks for nice pronunciation, so this video could be used for practicing English for intermediate and mid advanced English students."
6248,qs2QcycggWU,Will this available on ships. And made for a marine environment.?
6249,qs2QcycggWU,Love it!
6250,qs2QcycggWU,I think the explanation of the coupling between Wire and Patch given at 8:00 is wrong. The electrons shouldn't fly away and the coupling ist simply due to electromagnetic Induktion.
6251,qs2QcycggWU,excellent  video
6252,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant video ❤️
6253,qs2QcycggWU,*Now we know why 5G would kill us!*

6261,qs2QcycggWU,👌👍🙏
6262,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. 1k thanks :)
6263,qs2QcycggWU,Ahh hmmm BULLSHIT ALERT
6264,qs2QcycggWU,Will these high frequency signals kill or harm birds in it's path?
6265,qs2QcycggWU,No
6266,qs2QcycggWU,i hope it deilver in north korea. hope north korean people find out what it look like outside from prison country
6267,qs2QcycggWU,wow
6268,qs2QcycggWU,Best RF video I have ever seen.
6269,qs2QcycggWU,"Dammmmm by 6 mins I zoned out and woke 10 mins later 
Good video but heavy to grasp
Technology is a modern day marvel"
6270,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video, thank you very much."

6274,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome stuff man
6275,qs2QcycggWU,This is gold... Thank you for bringing science and technology in such a beautiful and precise way.
6276,qs2QcycggWU,"That video is jam-packed with information, thanks. Now I'll need to watch it a bunch more times to absorb a bit more each time  In my career field (I'm now retired) I brushed momentarily into QAM in modem technologies. As for packet processing, voice latency, priority queueing, error correction, T1 channelization and more, I can apply it to your discussion while realizing much has changed since 1973. In future videos I'll also be looking for something similar on Neural Net processing. Thanks again and cheers to all you and the team's efforts."
6277,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video! The technology is a masterpiece of engineering. 
I have a question though How does satellite beam to several antennas at the same time?"
6278,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for all this knowledge❤️
6279,qs2QcycggWU,Great work keep doing...💙
6280,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you... Thank you .. thank you so much.
I love the videos..."
6281,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, right down to the antenna theory.  James Maxwell applauds you :)    I'm an RF design engineer and have been working with phase array antenna systems for the last 3 decades. Now days I do a lot of the beam steering control code.  I'm passing your link on to some of my young coworkers, and others."
6282,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, great content!!"
6283,qs2QcycggWU,very naice
6284,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, this give me an even higher admiration for Elon and his great team of engineers.  

And gives me something to point to when I find in my recommended videos some idiots criticizing Elon with incredibly ignorant bullsh#t.  

There is this particular guy Thunderf00t who is always 'BUSTING"" Elon's achievements, with titles like ""Elon's neural link ""BUSTED"""", or ""Elon's tunnels 'REVEALED'... BUSTED""
 , yes he useS capital letter for that... and when you actually watch the vid, it is all speculations and more questions, never a ""busted"" thing... but if you read the comments in those videos you see tons of people agreeing with him on things they obviously do not understand. 
The thing is, I  have never known why they hate him so much."
6285,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
6286,qs2QcycggWU,The speed has slowed down too much to stream 5 HD movies anymore.
6287,qs2QcycggWU,This is incredible ❤️
6288,qs2QcycggWU,"Subscribed and liked, great videos and  great voice guy"
6289,qs2QcycggWU,Really great !
6290,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent work, thank you! Easily one of the best channels on YT."
6291,qs2QcycggWU,could you tell us the impact of having thousands of satellites in the lower orbit and the impact of the data transmission to our atmosphere in regards to; heat exchange and or disturbing the natural atmosphere? thanks
6292,qs2QcycggWU,"The videos quality is incredible, you deserve the world"
6293,qs2QcycggWU,I hope people always enjoy this kind of content.
6294,qs2QcycggWU,"Wanted  you 2 show us where EM wave radiation got its source? Is it only from battery or electricity? And show us in detail how datas r transfered? keep the good work, tx"
6295,qs2QcycggWU,"Sick animations. Your step by step approach and process of explaining and noting is incredible. This is a Million subs channel easily, so keep up the good work and onward to greatness"
6296,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you SO much! Your channel is a gift to humanity.
6297,qs2QcycggWU,"this video try to let me understand how it works,good good even i dont understand"
6298,qs2QcycggWU,fascinating
6299,qs2QcycggWU,yes
6300,qs2QcycggWU,"hey Jerry, would you like to scratch an antenna?"
6301,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible job!  Helps to understand how phased array radar works also.
6302,qs2QcycggWU,things like this is why i love engineering
6303,qs2QcycggWU,The phasing portion was awe inspiring. I love technology.
6304,qs2QcycggWU,"I've had StarLink since May of 2021 and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
We live so far back in the woods of western NC that we have to pipe in sunshine! No cable, no fiber, heck we barely have cell signal due to the mountains. But StarLink changed everything for us!! My wife is a teacher and she uses it for remote learning during Covid. And I get to enjoy youtube & HD movies from Netflix for the fist time :-)
Thank you StarLink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6305,qs2QcycggWU,Amazingly complex and mind boggling. But well explained
6306,qs2QcycggWU,"Could you please make video about Boinc distributed computing software, zooniverse, citizen scientist, Quantum moves, foldit, folding@home etc?"
6307,qs2QcycggWU,Impressive depth of this video. I'm truly amazed.
6308,qs2QcycggWU,If frequency phase is used to steer the beam. Why is it also used in signal sending. Wouldn't that affect the beam's direction? Thanks in advance for explanation. 😊
6309,qs2QcycggWU,"subscribed, liked, commented. now create more videos!"
6310,qs2QcycggWU,POS need to be removed
6311,qs2QcycggWU,No
6312,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink = spy = fandoghi
6313,qs2QcycggWU,It makes so much more sense when explained like this!
6314,qs2QcycggWU,Best explanation ever...  👍👍
6315,qs2QcycggWU,"So,  basically magic."
6316,qs2QcycggWU,I an writing a comment below
6317,qs2QcycggWU,Very well explained
6318,qs2QcycggWU,great explanation
6319,qs2QcycggWU,Hexagon is the bestagon.
6320,qs2QcycggWU,"super educational
it can't be perfect but as a mention, there was a moment when the octagonal array was called hexagonal lol"
6321,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for explaining
6322,qs2QcycggWU,What a confusing story!
6323,qs2QcycggWU,"This is how all school subject should be presented, in the perfect world."
6324,qs2QcycggWU,Luv My Dishy!! Thanks
6325,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome!! How can it have 20ms latency?
6326,qs2QcycggWU,Phenomenal video!
6327,qs2QcycggWU,My head hurts …..and I know this was the Stupid people’s explanation too 😣😳😩
6328,qs2QcycggWU,That’s an amazing video….I feel guilty watching stupid tik tok  videos
6329,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent
6330,qs2QcycggWU,I like this. Please make an Indonesian version of this channel
6331,qs2QcycggWU,My question is... How does the satalite manage all the data from all the dishes below them... And transfer them to another satellite after it passes the area with multiple dishes?
6332,qs2QcycggWU,How do the sattelite individually talk to thousands of starlinks? Does the sattelite have a Tbit connection or something?
6333,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant video - very informative and makes the topic interesting.
6334,qs2QcycggWU,"this video is crazy, subscribed"
6335,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent work
6336,qs2QcycggWU,"'watch at 1.25x speed the first time'
oops i was watching it at 2x speed the first time 😇
'a revolutionary engineer like elon musk' HAHAHA WHAT!? i thought this was a factual learning channel"
6337,qs2QcycggWU,Even if you don't like Elon you can't deny that he's an engineer
6338,qs2QcycggWU,Wow antennas are much  more complicated then i thought.
6339,qs2QcycggWU,the interruption on the connection because satelites move out of it's range can be quite annoying.
6340,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful!
6341,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is cool and stuff, but i am afraid we might lock ourselves on our plamet with thousands of satelites in low orbit. If a chain reaction occures leading to destruction of multiple satelites, we might be fucked"
6342,qs2QcycggWU,"Freedom from sanity and vision is amazing for the internet so, make it reachabke for all and safe"
6343,qs2QcycggWU,"I researched (=read everything I could get my hands on, there being no internet at home yet) about phased array radars way back in the 80s, when I was a kid diving into ""cool"" military stuff, like the Ticonderoga cruisers. Haven't touched it for a long time in my head, now it has come back and you have greatly added to it. Thanks a lot! Actually, I feel unreasonably motivated to get Starlink myself, just for the engineering fascination. Hope that goes away soon. :) Thanks again, you have a new subscriber."
6344,qs2QcycggWU,great  work😍😍
6345,qs2QcycggWU,You're right about 12 GHz RF being different to DC. Super high RF has a black magic component LOL. Great video BTW. Have a like and sub. Thanks you.
6346,qs2QcycggWU,"Does someone know how the Starlink satellites are communicating with the servers, e.g. the YouTube servers which contain the data to watch this video? Or isnt it any different than the communication between Dishy and the Starlink satellite?"
6347,qs2QcycggWU,It gets sent to the home dish then the satellite receives it beams it down to a ground station which is connected to all of the databases and then the same process in reverse.
6348,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! It blows my mind 😁
6349,qs2QcycggWU,"Very elaborate and interesting approach to explain all of this.
Thanks Branch Education"
6350,qs2QcycggWU,Easier and great explanation of complex topic. Thank You.
6351,qs2QcycggWU,Very detailed video. Especially I liked the explanation about beamforming and phase shifting. That was a great visual representation!
6352,qs2QcycggWU,This was unbelievably informative.  The animation combined with the clear and concise narration made this one of if not the best science/tech videos I've seen on YouTube.  Thank you!
6353,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing. Great video. I'm waiting for explanation how the starlink satellite looks like and how they communicate each other.
6354,qs2QcycggWU,"4 men slaughtered 3thousand yanks poisoned 10 thousand  in 30 mins  ira showed them how to set  bombs 
When the twin towers were   Being built   And detonated     Any time they  need too"
6355,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you sir.
6356,qs2QcycggWU,USA China Russia can destroy satellites in  6 mins 98 % of  internet on the sea floor
6357,qs2QcycggWU,This deserves more than 300.000 Views! Really cool video!
6358,qs2QcycggWU,Hope your chanel can reach to 1M sub soon!!!
6359,qs2QcycggWU,"First things first -  This is more than a great video! I am amazed!  Everything you said and showed is how the ground antenna communicates with the satellite, but how does the satellite communicate with the multitude of antennas on the ground? Does this mean that everything explained for the antenna on the ground is multiplied many times for the operation of the satellite? Because a lot of users are connected to one satellite every moment, and that means that the satellite must have many more ""beams"" pointed at all antennas on ground?"
6360,qs2QcycggWU,Great explaination
6361,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating for a simple housewife like me..thank you.
6362,qs2QcycggWU,"Damn that's an amazingly comprehensive video, way to go!!!"
6363,qs2QcycggWU,"your content is above par .
thankx for this video"
6364,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
6365,qs2QcycggWU,"That's the magic of electromagnets. About 15 years ago I always repair 2m transceiver and then in recent years I often handle the microwave for my home wifi internet system, it makes me easier to understand this video."
6366,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing editing 👏
6367,qs2QcycggWU,I really like this channel. Is there a patreon?
6368,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
6369,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing? Here's a fun fact, satellites have been around for quite a while. Thanks for confirming we're evolving backwards"
6370,qs2QcycggWU,Speed and latency already outdated before it even became popular and affordable for the mass of people. Besides it pollutes the sky at night massively and produces extremely amount of carbondioxide. Governments and space agencies all around the world should stop this bullshit initiated by one pubescent billionaire.
6371,qs2QcycggWU,Sounds like you live in the city and not a place that actually needs starlink.  Get off your high horse.
6372,qs2QcycggWU,"@@user-RCST do you really believe Elon does this to help people? Why don’t he build up a way cheaper and way more co2 friendly LTE or 5G system? He goes 400km from ground to space, why can’t he go 400km from ground to ground. Do you really believe people there can afford satellite equipment for 400dollars plus 70 dollars per month for an internet with shitty latency and low reliability? 
Please, folks, finally stop believing public companies are planning to help anyone."
6373,qs2QcycggWU,@@michaelp.6511 SpaceX isn't a charity they have to make money.  LTE and 5G would be much more expensive to get into these parts of the world.  The latency is pretty good and below 100ms for some.
6374,qs2QcycggWU,Mind is blown
6375,qs2QcycggWU,Wow
6376,qs2QcycggWU,no one really knows how it works but its theorized it works something like a mesh router system
6377,qs2QcycggWU,"As a qualified electro-mechanical engineer, I just want to say - this is truly mind blowing.. I feel like I just smoked a 2ft joint in a string theory lecture.. I have been staring at the wall in wonderment for 15min"
6378,qs2QcycggWU,Also.. incredible job explaining this is plain English..kudos
6379,qs2QcycggWU,I am a devout Branch Student
6380,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy is like a Radar used in Fighter jets!
6381,qs2QcycggWU,By creating electric and magnetic field we can produce EMF. Which can be used for data transmission.!!
6382,qs2QcycggWU,dishy
6383,qs2QcycggWU,Love the video
6384,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice video.
6385,qs2QcycggWU,When will this damn thing go into operation?
6386,qs2QcycggWU,Already is
6387,qs2QcycggWU,"It's a great video I'm still arranging the information and that's a lot for a mechanical engineer who is basically into product designing.
I got 26 shooting stars maybe I'm wrong."
6388,qs2QcycggWU,What about doppler shift effect? is there system implemented in satellites/dishes to stay locked on transmitting frequency even though it's changing constantly through orbit of satellite and it's location above surface?
6389,qs2QcycggWU,Dishy McFlatface is a Great British name
6390,qs2QcycggWU,I love the way you explain everything
6391,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome job weldone
6392,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice video. I love this channel ❤️.. Keep it up ❤️
6393,qs2QcycggWU,"The intelligence that is showcased in this video is truly astonishing! 
 Contrast that with the mental deficiencies that are exhibited by flat earthers, and other kinds of space travel deniers."
6394,qs2QcycggWU,As a Layman I watched at the higher speed and my nose began to bleed from the Johnny Mnemonic information overload.
6395,qs2QcycggWU,WOW. On both accounts: technology and presentation.
6396,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
6397,qs2QcycggWU,"7:50 "".....and that's how the Rockwell Retro Encabulator works!"""

6399,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow so much detail, very impressive, appreciate your hard work, i love it 😘"
6400,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this reminds me the fact that we take everything for granted in our lives. So much of effort and ingenuity put into developing these mind bogglingly complex technologies
6401,qs2QcycggWU,"Exactly praveen sir,
I was looking for indian comment.
I am agree with what you said.

Indian education system requires drastic changes and immediete attention of policy makers ."
6402,qs2QcycggWU,really rally incredible high quality video thank you so much! it was amazing to watch everything about it was perfect! :) subbed

6405,qs2QcycggWU,sorry I don't like this video I love it
6406,qs2QcycggWU,I'm watching this on Starlink.
6407,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done. I am a communication expert who has worked with Bell labs in Lucent. There are a very few works on any platform that are so lucid. Continue the good work.
6408,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you to everyone who made this possible!
6409,qs2QcycggWU,well done !
6410,qs2QcycggWU,Well done!  Best explanation of phased array transmission I have ever seen.
6411,qs2QcycggWU,This is so great! Thank you for this very informative video.
6412,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes, the video is gaining views."
6413,qs2QcycggWU,"5:20 Oh dear, I'm about to learn something..."
6414,qs2QcycggWU,"Any information on the transmitted power levels of Dishy, and its input power consumption ?   Great video, enjoyed it as an Amateur Radio operator.  Thank you!"
6415,qs2QcycggWU,Nice video
6416,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing work!
6417,qs2QcycggWU,Way too complicated for me. Glad Elon could make this work. Does he ever do anything that’s not way difficult.  He is amazing
6418,qs2QcycggWU,Lying is not that difficult...
6419,qs2QcycggWU,Good vid
6420,qs2QcycggWU,Keep em coming mayne
6421,qs2QcycggWU,the technology in it is crazy
6422,qs2QcycggWU,If you listen to it at 2X speed he just sounds like that guy that tries to give you the rest of the details at the end of a commercial. you know the disclaimer guy that talks really fast and tells you how screwed you are buying this piece of crap but it's so fast you don't quite catch it
6423,qs2QcycggWU,YT is getting bold with these double and triple ads. Like im interested in drag queen 2FA smh
6424,qs2QcycggWU,sweet
6425,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic explanation and visuals - thx!!
6426,qs2QcycggWU,GREAT! Video. I love the hard work u put into making it. SUBBED!
6427,qs2QcycggWU,"It's so cool that some of the tech used by Dishy was from the early 80s when modems were still used for data communication.  As we multiplexing these signals, tech had to be created to for combining then breaking multiple signals back out again.  The phone company had been doing that for decades with analog signals.  Let us not forget, though, that the first electrical digital data was made popular by Samuel F.B. Morse in the early 1800s and within 100 years the Teletype Corporation was transmitting readable print electronically -- the beginnings of modern data communications!  Hat's off to the makers of this video for making new technology understandable to those of us who worked the grandparents of this tech when it was new."
6428,qs2QcycggWU,That was a superb tutorial and I learned a lot.  Thank you for making this effort and sharing it.  Greetings from Arizona.
6429,qs2QcycggWU,This is the best anmiated video i have ever seen. Incredible how people can do stuff like thjs
6430,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown....
6431,qs2QcycggWU,"These are exactly my kind of educational videos. Clear, concise, plenty of visual aids, and not miles over my head."
6432,qs2QcycggWU,"Production quality: max. Price: free. 
If I can give a million likes, I will."
6433,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a question regarding amplitude modulation. Doesn't varying the amplitude mean sending at a lower output power when the value is represented by a low amplitude, thereby decreasing the range of the signal at that precise moment? Or am I missing something"
6434,qs2QcycggWU,"Yup, the SNR decreases if the amplitude is lower, but if done very narrowly it won't have much effect."
6435,qs2QcycggWU,@@timc7035 Ok I see
6436,qs2QcycggWU,😁
6437,qs2QcycggWU,And you recommend watching at a higher rate? Funny.
6438,qs2QcycggWU,"These are awesome, more please!"
6439,qs2QcycggWU,Better to watch these kind of videos rather than wasting time on tiktok….
6440,qs2QcycggWU,UP
6441,qs2QcycggWU,Brah.
6442,qs2QcycggWU,Super video !!
6443,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing animations! The phase shifting appears to work a lot like how VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) in aviation navigation, a technology that's been in use since the 1940s. This allows aircraft to follow a degree-accurate beam to or from any VOR station. 2 VOR stations can be tuned in to pick up an intersection between both stations."
6444,qs2QcycggWU,awsome
6445,qs2QcycggWU,This video was very interesting definitely a lot of knowledge I can use The antenna design is the most interesting part
6446,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
6447,qs2QcycggWU,amazing!
6448,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine LTE for cellular can use 256 QAM or 8 bits per symbol.
6449,qs2QcycggWU,I don't think any women watched this video lol

6459,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
6460,qs2QcycggWU,This is good but I'm not understanding anything 😭💔
6461,qs2QcycggWU,How does the satellite communicate with multiple different dishes on earth at once? How does it know where to aim the beams?
6462,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for going over what wasn't accurate and posting errata. It really shows you care.
6463,qs2QcycggWU,"Yo , it completely blew my mind , this level of engineering and quality of your videos."
6464,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
6465,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing!
6466,qs2QcycggWU,Wow! I'm a retired Nuke Engineer with a BS in Physics. This brought me back to the days of being an undergrad trying to comprehend antenna theory. My early career was in submarines where I got to see the phased array stuff in the real world with sonar and radar. Great video!
6467,qs2QcycggWU,Nice video.
6468,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best explanations of antenna theory I have seen in decades of being an EE.
6469,qs2QcycggWU,I've never seen a more simple yet comprehensive breakdown of SATCOM. This was amazing! Please do more!
6470,qs2QcycggWU,Who thinks of this? I’m surrounded by people that can’t ties their shoe laces . I’d rather feel stupid and be surrounded by people that think like this.
6471,qs2QcycggWU,Very good video but I'm pretty dissapointed that there was no mention of how the satelites communicate with/through eachother and only one short mention of them comunicating with the ground stations.
6472,qs2QcycggWU,"I just realized that l am very STUPID 
thanks"

6476,qs2QcycggWU,It's beyond my comprehension...
6477,qs2QcycggWU,You got yourself a new subscriber due mostly to the last 5 mins of the video. Knowing it took 2 months to make and the cleicfications at the end whilst obvious things wernt to scale i like the fact you cleified the fact
6478,qs2QcycggWU,"I think YouTube recommended this because I was looking stuff up for Starlink, the video game. But I love technology videos too, great job! ☺️"
6479,qs2QcycggWU,informative but EM waves do not interfere with each other.
6480,qs2QcycggWU,I sometimes feel incredibly inadequate when I realize how smart other humans like me are! I wonder how much effort it goes into the creation of such ingenious products
6481,qs2QcycggWU,Nise effect
6482,qs2QcycggWU,Great job
6483,qs2QcycggWU,Thankyou for the effort put in for this video!  Very well explained!
6484,qs2QcycggWU,Truly awesome... engineering to next level...love it
6485,qs2QcycggWU,great video. one nitpick is that tv satellites are almost always geosynchronous and the video didnt show that
6486,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink wasn't for people who lived in big cities with fiber optic internet already available, but for rural areas where there is no FO or Copper (Coaxial) cable internet available nearby, since most satellite internet today are came from geostationary orbit satellite, it's too slow with 1000ms or more ping (you simply can't play online multiplayer game on satellite internet) or too expensive to install cable internet, starlink is the solution."
6487,qs2QcycggWU,"I'll give you a tip....
Anyone that says this..
"" with 1000ms or more ping""
is broadcasting to people that do know that they don't know what they are talking about

If you're  a gamer and you're going to talk about something AT LEAST KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

I hear this all the time from gamers, then i ask them ""and what exactly is ping ?""
and they usually don't know

so...
some tips
1. PING is the test ,  Not the speed .
saying ""I have 50 ping"" is an incorrect and illogical statement , it's on the same level as driving in a car at 50km per hour and saying ""I'm doing 50 Car""

2. it's also not measuring speed, but speed can be derived from it, 
it's actually measuring round trip time in (ms) milliseconds,  this is referred to in terms of LATENCY (or Delay)

it works like this (simply stated)
PING is not a test,    it's a program
Now, this program uses a sub protocol called  ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
so.. the ping program sends out an ICMP Echo request to the destination server

if the server gets that request it will ack (Acknowledge) it and ""Echo"" Resend the same request back to the destination server
THIS IS CALLED ""A Round Trip""

Now you also need to consider other things like 
TCP/IP vs UDP
so generally speaking when you use speedtest.net or ookla you are using TCP/ IP
Meaning....
When using TCP/IP  it incorporate Error correction , Meaning.. IT'S SLOWER Because it has things to calculate

UDP on the other hand is used in gaming (as one example) because 
WHEN YOUR'E PLAYING CSGO (for example) and you shoot some cunt in the head
well. it goes like this 
Your computer (because you shot him) sends a signal to the server (say  ROKSTAR) then it sends that signal of bullet data to the guy you shot

THERE IS NO NEED TO VERIFY IF THE DATA WAS RECEIVED CORRECTLY
because after you empty a clip of say 50 rounds
who gives two fucks if 1 of those bullets were not delivered correctly 
so.. UDP is faster and used in gaming
which is why it's not fair to run a ping test from google vs from your game

Now...  this is the part i call
GET A FUCKING LIFE
i see gamers debating the difference between 23ms Ping and 20ms ping
well... GET A FUCKING LIFE
You are literally debating the difference of 3 milliseconds
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO NOTICE ANY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR GAMEPLAY 

GENERAL RULE OF THUMB,   Anything under 50ms is fine and nothing to worry about 
if you're debating the difference between 40ms  vs 30 ms  you need to get a life
I've had gamers who had 12ms latency and they were trying to achive 8ms latency 
that's like having a lamborghini that can do 300km per hour and saying i need it to get to 300.2 km per hour
WHO GIVES A FUCK... Seriously !!!

so now we get to the end of this shit

HERE IS HOW YOU SAY IT CORRECTLY

You do not say 
"" it's too slow with 1000ms or more ping""

YOU DO SAY
""With a latency of 1000ms or more, it's too slow""
or
""With a latency of 1000ms or more on a ping test it's too slow""
or
""During a ping test you receive a latency of 1000ms or more and it's too slow""

You are measuring time
you are measuring latency
You are not measuring ping,    PING IS A PROGRAM that runs a communication test"

6489,qs2QcycggWU,"That’s some pretty ínstense info. How much power does it draw from Being plugged in my house to do all of this? Or in other words, for someone like me who doesn’t understand the science, more or less, how much does it cost to operate per month or year in a normal house. Thanks."
6490,qs2QcycggWU,"Fantastic video. I love that you don't shy away from difficult topics, and coming from someone in a background in, optics, EM, and electronics, I think the visuals are masterful, and allow nearly anyone to follow along. Very well done!"

6493,qs2QcycggWU,"Quite good, actually. I'm impressed."
6494,qs2QcycggWU,How are the satalites powered ? I’m thinking they’d require a lot of power
6495,qs2QcycggWU,"I was just amazed watching it!! I looks like out of this world technology! Elon Musk and his engineering team are incredible!!! I understand pretty much everything abou radio transmiting, but this stuff is mindblowing!!!"

6505,qs2QcycggWU,It’s crazy. Hearing about Starlink back in 2015. “They’re never going to make this happen” I thought. Got my Starlink in summer 2021 and I love it to this day. Amazing feat.
6506,qs2QcycggWU,quick question how does weather affect this? i live in a tropical country where typhoons and monsoons are constant whole year round.
6507,qs2QcycggWU,can you explain how starlink satellites communicate with each other ?

6512,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent!!!
6513,qs2QcycggWU,"This was very well done. Pretty accurate too. I'm familiar with most of the concepts from my days as an aviation nav technician. For example phased arrays were used for instrument landing systems. In those cases the modulation sent to the left and right sides of the array varied, one side 90hz, the other side 150 Hz. The plane found its position buy balancing the volumes of the two tones. I'm sure things have moved on considerably from then 30 years ago, a subject for another video?"
6514,qs2QcycggWU,Nope.  The ILS and VORs still work the same as they did 30 years ago.  GPS can't beat the precision that you get with narrowing radio beams as you get closer to the glideslope and localizer antennas.
6515,qs2QcycggWU,Sorry but ILS glideslope or localizer antennas are not phased array and never have been. They use polarization and a different frequency for either side of the runway. Phased array means steering the beam without physically moving the antenna. ILS “beams” don’t need to move at all.
6516,qs2QcycggWU,Nice
6517,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the best explanation of beam forming and phased arrays i've come across 
Great work here"
6518,qs2QcycggWU,"Great explanations, well presented, and a nice lesson with a clear voice of the narrator, good job."
6519,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Thank you!
6520,qs2QcycggWU,All I can say is WOW!
6521,qs2QcycggWU,"Nicely done, great use of graphics, well explained"
6522,qs2QcycggWU,Like I said. 😂😂😂
6523,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.  I never realised how it works. I have had Starlink for a while now. It’s a great system
6524,qs2QcycggWU,You must profoundly debilitated to accept that the night sky would be totally polluted with all these useless satellites
6525,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video, thanks for the time you put into it. Could you also explain how many dishies one satalite could connect. And does the Starlink satelite also directs its signal to dishies or is it more like a television satelite. Still, how would one dishies know what data was meant for it."
6526,qs2QcycggWU,this video has blown my mind
6527,qs2QcycggWU,"5:21 Did you use a Gilligan's Island radio on purpose, for this graphic?"
6528,qs2QcycggWU,That background noise is awful.
6529,qs2QcycggWU,"Absolutely blown away by the quality of this video. I covered a lot of this during an MElecEng but none of it was ever explained in such a concise  and detailed manner.
You managed to go from near-basics up through advanced antenna design in logical steps whilst still retaining core concepts and making it broadly understandable. Bravo!"
6530,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video! 

Question: In the notes you say that the other satellite internet providers use geostationary satellites, and then that the ground dishes they communicate with continuously move on motors in order to point at the satellite. I don't understand this part. If it's a geostationary satellite, wouldn't you just need to point it that one time at the satellite and just keep it pointed in the exact same direction all the time? The satellite should be staying fixed relative to you, shouldn't it? Or is not as accurate and thus you have to compensate for some small deviations (just guessing here, I have no real idea about it)...?"
6531,qs2QcycggWU,"I think you may be mixing ground stations for geostationary satellites with the low earth orbit ground stations used with Starlink.  This video discusses both at different times.  Geostationary ground stations do not need to move, but Starlink ground stations do move on motors.   See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isp0jfoj8nI where a lady ""tours"" a Starlink ground station.  There is a nice cutaway diagram of a ground station at 4:25 of her 7 minute video."
6532,qs2QcycggWU,"@@randyarmour6774 No, I was talking about his comments in the notes. As in English (Canadian). I wasn't mixing up the types of ground stations."

If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once again😁 solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST.

6540,qs2QcycggWU,"If earth goes around the sun making an elliptic path, then we should have 2 summer and 2 winter in 1 year. But in reality, sun circles above our flat earth closer to north making smaller circle in April may , so it's summer for north countries and winter for australia the same month. In December, sun makes bigger circle close to australia, so summer there and winter for north countries. It makes perfect sense. EARTH IS FLAT. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE NEVER EXISTED.
 _ some other globers say earth is revolving in a circular path with off centered sun, then you got huge problem, for some months sun should be huge in size and very small for other months. But in reality sun appears the same size for all 12 months in a year. Busted again.

6543,qs2QcycggWU,"This video was absolutely amazing!
I am extremely curious about modern technology but frankly I’m not that smart of a fellow but you made it very easy to understand.
Thank you so very much for taking the time to create this presentation.
 I am subscribing to your other videos now."
6544,qs2QcycggWU,"DON'T EVER PUT YOURSELF DOWN LIKE THAT MATE
I'm an Engineer, i can tell you this much
if you understood the video.... you are smart enough to learn it"
6545,qs2QcycggWU,Thought that it would use a RF Circulator to allow TX and RX at the same time.
6546,qs2QcycggWU,Having that many separate antennas is it possible to create not one but few main lobes and track many satellites at once? Is it how military phased arrays radars track multiple targets?
6547,qs2QcycggWU,The Starlink Dish is similar to the BSB Satellite dish but the BSB Satellite does not have transmit capabilities.
6548,qs2QcycggWU,This video was awesome. Hooked within the first 14 seconds
6549,qs2QcycggWU,Great Video!
6550,qs2QcycggWU,This video was extraordinarily well researched and presented. Thank you very much for making this!
6551,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent. Another subject that is fascinating is the development of the Compact Disc, over 40 years ago. Philips has published the complete story of this and I bought a copy. Its practically as mind boggling as Dishy is and works on the principle of the wave length of light. Its a lot more clever than many give it credit for."
6552,qs2QcycggWU,"im more fascinated by the design of the array antenna than the satellite itself. although, its still fascinating that the satellite connected by laser light which timing is precise. i tried to build a wifi atenna long ago and still couldnt really understand the nature how intricate of the diameter of the length for the signal to actually works. even though there were some who gave the layout, i think i couldnt installed it exactly at the length to capture and or receive signal to boost signal."
6553,qs2QcycggWU,Loved this so much!
6554,qs2QcycggWU,cool thanks
6555,qs2QcycggWU,EFFECTIVE radiated power of the main beam and the side lobes would be nice to know as well as how far away some grounded aluminum screen would protect our hippocampus from brittle diabeties LOL?  ;-)
6556,qs2QcycggWU,I'm most amazed that this can be made cheaply.
6557,qs2QcycggWU,This is an incredible video! Thanks for explaining this so well with visual models!
6558,qs2QcycggWU,How do satellite transmitters not interfere with each other? Is there some sort of orthogonalization like what happens in radio waves in WiFi?
6559,qs2QcycggWU,How apm and phase of waves dose involve in both the angle of bim and the data in bit? Doesn't it interact with each other?
6560,qs2QcycggWU,"Years ago in electronic class, one of the most mind blowing lesson i can remember was when i learned about 64QAM, and while watching the video I was so amazed to see that they use it for Starlink. 
I had no clue about the steared Beam and the complexity of what i thought was a simple dish antenna and it really amazed me ! 
What i'm most impressed with, is that we get to watch such good quality content for free on the internet.
 Keep up the good work !"

6604,qs2QcycggWU,thanks you ..so much one of the most informative videos I have seen at present...
6605,qs2QcycggWU,That is crazy-level complex... and very interesting.
6606,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome video, thank you. If I would subscribe to brilliant I would use your link just to honor the awesomeness of the work put in this video."
6607,qs2QcycggWU,"Nothing new really... this is similar technology as Satellite TV mixed with a bit of cellular tower tech, nothing new really... Problem with this idea is the amount of Satellites you will need to make this viable,  10000 Satellites sound like an expensive public project to cover areas that very few people need internet access because the rest of us live in a city were internet service is faster than any Satellite internet out there... I bet Elon is going to ask for huge Government public loans and grants to make this possible. Assuming the size of the Satellite and based on what Nasa said about the price of sending one of these into low orbit, it will cost around 1 million $ dollars x 10 000 = 10 billion $ dollars just to send them into orbit. Do not forget that building these is very expensive and operating them is not cheap either.... All this to offer internet to areas were internet is not needed by a large amount of people...is wasteful.  100% this is going to cost people a lot more in taxes then they realize it."
6608,qs2QcycggWU,"Sorry this does not make any sense, the satellites sit in geostationary orbit, meaning they travel at the same speed as Earth's rotation and therefore remain positioned above the same point on the ground. The dish initially locks on to a satellite and once it is locked on it doesn't continuous follow a moving satellite, that just wouldn't make any sense as it would have to keep on switching to another satellite."
6609,qs2QcycggWU,"Martin  No, Starlink isn't in geostationary orbit.  He was referring to others which are."
6610,qs2QcycggWU,"What an informative video, you nailed it Teddy. I will watch it once again tomorrow. The video is so rich in information "

6616,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, 20ms one way, 40ms round trip. Plus the distant of the server, you’ve got at least 60-100ms of lag. That’s just unacceptable"
6617,qs2QcycggWU,"@@peterthegamer9334 From here in London GB my ping is usually somewhere between 13 to 17mS if it goes to 20mS  I stop playing as my characters are Solo /Hardcore  and the aim is not to get the character killed, Starlink is a non-starter for anyone that even thinks they are a gamer.   "
6618,qs2QcycggWU,@@IbnBahtuta I bet its incredible coverage can be good for anything else other than hardcore gaming though. Especially in remote areas.
6619,qs2QcycggWU,"im glad I already understood some of this stuff, its very informative regardless of expert skill level.
QAM PSK modulation is used on cable modems also. Phased arrays and beamforming used on 5G. The whole system is like 300 different cutting edge scientific/engineering technologies put together. But the RF microwave stuff is whats really black magic. The holy grail."

But in the animation at 2:50 the TV satellite is not geostationary... but it should have the same angular velocity as the earth... But still great video the criticism is on a very high level"
6625,qs2QcycggWU,"Felix  Starlink isn't but other TV satellites are.  He was talking about both, but they orbit differently."
6626,qs2QcycggWU,@@SMHman666 Ofcurse there are diffreces... for example are the TV ones always above the same ground around the globe and all of them are around the equator. they are locked with the earths rotation !
6627,qs2QcycggWU,@@Flix_us His animation and his explanation could've been better.
6628,qs2QcycggWU,@@SMHman666 Well i guess it just wasn't that important and the video is always full of Information
6629,qs2QcycggWU,"While I was watching this video, my mind began to wander in reference to other applications to the technology.  We all know there is a lot of radiation in space.  Could this technology be used to collect the radiation electrons and channel and concentrate the electron flow it to provide propulsion electrons for a space craft?  This might solve a few problems, the collection process would lower, if not eliminate radiation in the direction of travel, depending upon the velocity of the craft and the concentrated exit of electrons would move the craft.  Another benefit of the system would be that the abundance of fuel would be virtually in exhaustible and would not be needed storage space on the vehicle.  I am about as smart as a mud fence in a monsoon rain, I am assuming that this has already been thought of by people much smarter than me.  While I have many more thoughts on this, I will stop inconveniencing electrons, which could be used for other purposes, and close.  Thank you for your time.  Have an excellent day."

6636,qs2QcycggWU,If I'm not wrong.. there's 12 shooting stars all-in-all.
6637,qs2QcycggWU,Magic?  Obvious downvote.
6638,qs2QcycggWU,"Complex and amazing, but what about the signal coming from the ISPs/ground stations? Does Starlink have many ground based stations to beam data to each of the satellites, or is there less ground stations with the satellites communicating between themselves and then beaming it to the dish? What I mean is, does the data chain go ground-satellite-dish, or ground-satellite-satellite-satellite-dish with potentially more or less satellites in between"
6639,qs2QcycggWU,"It's Ground->satellite->dish and vice versa. Laser link hasn't been enabled yet.  Each ground station has to be in view of a satellite or a satellite can't provide service. There are over 90 ground stations and the satellites have 900km range. Each station costs a couple million dollars in hardware, but the lifespan is much longer than the satellites. 10% of all internet traffic is netflix, so it's possible for them to install a CDN system on a satellite that would allow the satellite to communicate with the dish and seldom interact with the ground station for certain traffic and there are other CDNs they can add to the satellites, too."
6640,qs2QcycggWU,Who believes this nonsense? Anyone with a brain knows space is fake.
6641,qs2QcycggWU,"Once again, incredible video. You are one of the top creators on YouTube to me. Your research and visualizations are second to none. Thank you for what you do! Please never stop!!"

6643,qs2QcycggWU,My only concern about Starlink and signing up with Mr. Musks smartphone service is Putin.  Musk has been pissing Putin off for awhile now and I could see Putin sending satellite busters up to knock down areas of Starlink.   Just a thought.

6647,qs2QcycggWU,kjm 1955  Not at all.  Maybe watch it again to clarify things you didn't understand first time.
6648,qs2QcycggWU,Can’t get any better
6649,qs2QcycggWU,"How does the satellite receive and send from many ""Dishies"" at the same time? How would it distinguish multiple dishes? Does it use something similar to WiFi/ethernet algorithms (like, try sending, if many send at the same time, stop and try again after random delay?) and if so, would one single malicious ""Dishy"" take the whole thing down by continuously sending to a satellite?"
6650,qs2QcycggWU,"I would imagine it would use M.A.C. (Media Access Control) Addresses to do that.
this would also explain how, if in the future he wishes to add more dishes to the network, how he would do that 
Basic Layer 2 networking and you just go from there

as for the communication, it's 2 way , but not simultaneous
so... Not Full Duplex,   but Half Duplex Transmission"

6682,qs2QcycggWU,your channel is one of best sources of explanatory videos of complex engineering works
6683,qs2QcycggWU,Definitely the coolest video I’ll watch today
6684,qs2QcycggWU,"It's insane how brilliant minds super smart theoretical physicists, come up with the science to verify and put stuff like this into production. It all starts with a theory."

6687,qs2QcycggWU,Well done! That was a great explanation.
6688,qs2QcycggWU,"That graphic at 2 minutes 30ish is totally wrong, the tv satellite should be moving in the same directon as the earth at the SAME SPEED, thats the whole point, They are geostationary. also I think starlink satellites move in the same direction as the earth too"

6692,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, great presentation, loved it"
6693,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes my mind was blown.  But if the satellite is talking to one dish, and there are a mere 10,000 satellites in orbit.  Only one satellite can be over a single geographical point of the earth where they could be many dishes within the 100° arch of the dish. How does it communicate with many dishes at one time.  I know that the speed of exchange is fast. So it the satellite only transmitting and receiving from one ground dish at a time?"
6694,qs2QcycggWU,Really interesting content. Well done! Can you make a video about the ground-station satellite broadcast? And one on multi-dish satellite communication?
6695,qs2QcycggWU,thanks for sharing...

6709,qs2QcycggWU,Phased array antenna was first used in the 1980s MIG fighter jets to track multiple targets.
6710,qs2QcycggWU,"I'm curious.. does the phase modulation of a signal not obstruct the performance of the phased array? 

It seems like it would be much harder to steer a beam into a certain direction when the phase already needs to have a specific value because of the modulation."

 A bit more connectivity in a world that already has coverage pretty much everywhere is certainly not worth losing the ability to enjoy natural beauty anywhere at night anymore, but now those horribly bright and obnoxious satellites make their unwelcome appearance no matter where you go and the sky is ruined perhaps forever. Whoever decided this was OK is absolutely Evil."

When starlink first came on line I did not understand its concept, but this video cleared up much of how starlink worked. Great work in explaining this video how starlink operates….."
6760,qs2QcycggWU,"Really awesome video. Wanted to know about the the data encoding, would the amplitude be reliable all the time, when using amplitude and phase shift? What if the medium change and the amplitude changes a little."
6761,qs2QcycggWU,"Well yes, the US was pretty good of making a junkyard of herself so why stop there. There a whole lot of space right on top of the world we could do the same.

6762,qs2QcycggWU,"there is no space junk. there is plenty of lies to this story. just keeping this space junk in LE orbit would be massively costly for even trying to do that. all of elon musks endeavours mostly exist only on the internet and media. because if it was tried to do in reality, there would be no money to fund it. immense amounts of energy spent, for little temporary effect before it all comes back to equilibrium."

6770,qs2QcycggWU,This is one of the best videos on YT right now. Amazing. Thank You so much.
6771,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting, I watched this at 1.5 speed and understood it all I think. It is feasible to have NEARLY 1.5Gbs at 2 TO 5ms latency if you used two Dishys with one in receive mode ONLY and one in NORMAL MODE if I am understanding this correctly. The reason for possible increased latency is since each dishy has about a 100 degree field of view, you could potentially have the two dishys pointed in different directions about 720 meters apart, using cat6 or better to a central location and have a much wider coverage, especially if at the peak of a mountain with one dishy not physically being able to ""see"" the other. This would provide, while both are operating, much faster speeds in both uplink and downlink, and if one goes down, while link speeds will slow, it will not die entirely.
A few questions:
1. How many sats are currently in orbit and what is the number per year on the planning board to put the required amount in orbit for continuous coverage with a few hundred extra thrown in for redundancy?
2.  Will the cost come down as more sats go up?
3. What is the reason for NOT using geostationary sats? Seems that if the sats were geostationary, then the beam steering would not really be needed and used only to fine tune the signal strength!
Thank you for an outstanding video. For me it was informative and makes me want to learn more!"
6772,qs2QcycggWU,seriously multideciplinary
6773,qs2QcycggWU,I am a phased array product manager  for the satellite industry (25 years).  This is an amazing explanation and perfect for engineers to understand how this technology works
6774,qs2QcycggWU,Do you have a transcript of the Canadian subtitles?
6775,qs2QcycggWU,@@gerencher isn't canadian english?
6776,qs2QcycggWU,"since you are, phased array product manager for the satellite industry, for 25 years, how much do you think this is real, and profitable? it seems, way too much effort for very little benefit. 
firstly 99% people of the earth already have internet that is faster better and stronger then starlink. 
so how does elon come up with the magical funds to fund this, loss making venture? it requires 1000's of sattelites to operate. not even 5% of sattelites are engaged as a given time. most of them floating over oceans and deserts. the sattelites will need to be replenished for power and propelant. this means it will need to replace the sattelites every few years. knowing LE orbit means probably even faster.
is this a scam of some sorts? and for what? to spread panic and fear? thats the daily bread of people now a days.
so can you tell?"
6777,qs2QcycggWU,"The Starlink ""Dishy McFlatface"" (cute name) sends out the radio wave to a big wide direction. 
The power is sent wide. 
Happens to be, if you time it right (slight offset each), they add in one angle of their beam."

6827,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology.
6828,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent. Nicely done.
6829,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the awesome free video
6830,qs2QcycggWU,100%fantastic mind boggling with my some what basic understanding of electrical theory and electronic theory i have a cloudy vague understanding it is amazing what great things man can do  you or i have to let my mind go and think of the far fetched  science  we are moving at a pace that 100 years ago you would be a nut to even come up with science  unreal  i hope we dont destroy ourself in the process
6831,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome  video capturing tons of concept and gives clear views through great animation 👍 👏 👌
6832,qs2QcycggWU,"It seems like the bottleneck to this is the amount of satellites over a given area, so like with Wi-Fi it switches between clients on the ground. How many customers can it serve before decline in speed or latency?"
6833,qs2QcycggWU,"It is rare I have to think deeply about a technical effect. 
9:00
I had to start more ""thinking"" processes to process this."
6834,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing
6835,qs2QcycggWU,"... and it actually works. My mind is boggled. It seems pretty much indistinguishable from magic.
The mathematicians and coders who designed the systems are modern wizards.
So the machines which make the components can conjurer silicon, metal, and plastic into life, weaving empty space into auras and vibrations, to let your kids watch cat videos - and your teenagers learn science!"

6845,qs2QcycggWU,"holy cow the amount of digestible information in this video is like, holy cow. This is the video all serious beginners in electronics must watch. Its one thing to know about it and how it works in your head but to see it so perfectly animated was satisfying AF like a massage for my brain. would be super awesome to see and understand the math. Around 24mins seems to be missing quite allot but PSK/phase shift keying is a video on its own. You need a reference and a lock because as it stands as explained in the video qam 64 would be defeated by atmospheric aberrations while attempting beam forming. What a serious bit of kit. its brought up too in creators comments. curiousmarc and his Apollo comms series explains PSK. its a really wild concept and takes a while to grasp. Took a few resources for me and I could still use a refresher."
6846,qs2QcycggWU,I’m amazed by the quality and details of the video.
6847,qs2QcycggWU,"This was an incredible video, thank you so much for your efforts!"
6848,qs2QcycggWU,amazing.
6849,qs2QcycggWU,"One question: AFAIK, clocks between any two electronic devices aren't easily synchronized; and I imagine they might be too slow to catch these pico-second period of carrier signal anyways.
So how are the antennae detecting the phase shift accurately? If it mis-calculated the phase shift one symbol, then does it affect the next symbol too?"
6850,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, found my new favorite channel"
6851,qs2QcycggWU,This is unreal. I love that you made this. Thank you.

6855,qs2QcycggWU,This. Is. Legit!
6856,qs2QcycggWU,Pretty good but there are a few mistakes.
6857,qs2QcycggWU,Traditional dish antennas point to geosynchronous satellites. Your animation should show the satellite in sync with the Earth's rotation so that from the ground it appears to not move its position relative to the ground.
6858,qs2QcycggWU,this bullshit sadens me to no end JUST STOP IT
6859,qs2QcycggWU,Grow up!
6860,qs2QcycggWU,@@CNCmachiningisfun u trust gov scientists and your life is bull

6862,qs2QcycggWU,Gawd. All that intelligence so I can watch cat videos.
6863,qs2QcycggWU,This was an EXCELLENT explanation!!
6864,qs2QcycggWU,What a great video! That brief but effective QAM explanation was a treat.
6865,qs2QcycggWU,"First time viewer here, I just want to say I could immediately understand the concepts as well as the engineering put into this, as the video was playing. I have to commend you guys on the channel for breaking it down barney style for us."
6866,qs2QcycggWU,"Ok, now you cant shout at the tv when your satellite goes out. People work hard you know 😡"
6867,qs2QcycggWU,"Low flying satellites - heard about the idea in 99.

6872,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for sharing.
6873,qs2QcycggWU,Cool stuff bad name dishy L💀L😋
6874,qs2QcycggWU,OUTSTANDING!!!!  I am a fan.
6875,qs2QcycggWU,Good technology... but I thought Elon developed for Fintech  and low latency stock exchange transactions... and thereby making more money..  Elon is a very good hearted person...he might have created it because it is critical for smooth gaming :))

6879,qs2QcycggWU,I love YouTube for these videos.
6880,qs2QcycggWU,Wow!
6881,qs2QcycggWU,"How does the Starlink satellite talk to multiple Dishys with each array on satellite?  Does it just timeshare the signals like a CPU?  Or does each individual satellite get saturated with 4 Dishys?  I know there are a lot of satellites in the constellation, so maybe saturation isn’t going to be a problem."
6882,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, appreciate your hard work. It really shows!"
6883,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video and content.  Thank you so much!
6884,qs2QcycggWU,A great documentary.  Congratulations
6885,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for watching to the end
6886,qs2QcycggWU,"I wonder how the satellite manage a lot of dishes, like for a few ok slight frequency change can work but for an everyone internet I wonder what's the limit..
Btw awesome video, like always!
(PS : telling ppls to watch video at faster speed doesn't reduce watchtime stats, therefore the audience reach by the video ?)"
6887,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow. The amount of detail you guys went into is amazing! First video I've ever watched where I felt obligated to Like, Comment, and Subscribe. lol"
6888,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind blowing perfection
6889,qs2QcycggWU,"that is why it is soo expensive,"
6890,qs2QcycggWU,"Realy? no tv satellite has internet possibility?
....
No way for smaller dish for lets say a moving car?
...
Wouldn't higher altitude allow for less satelites at expense of ping which honestly for use of satelite internet is actually pointless?
...
Does ammount of antenna differ from regular satelite internet dish if so why?
...
You explain greatly how regular radio works but is it any different from how walkie-talkie antenna works - how is this new?
....
Pico second sounds amazing... Oh wait 10^-12 thats basicly saying gigahertz but how many hertz there was...sounds amazing till you realize you can buy such antenna for decades and build long before
...
Amplification is nice but is it new? Anything to do with parabolic shape of the thing?
Does realy hexagonal matter? What would happen if i used any other pattern to fill a plane?
...
No 1280 is actually 1 antenna same as we although used every single radio telescope to get picture of a black hole it for sake of a ""lense"" was 1 telescope
...
Phased array is neat way of saying if satellite isn't where you aim you have no connection...dont believe me... Move that thing to face 30 degrees any other direction.... Oh look no more connection that is also a reason why 10k satelites are needed for full cover
....
And software requires something not mentioned... accurate clock...accurate to that picosecond long-term wise...that requires battery... Cr2032 replacers will know what that means...since you cant disassemble
....
6 bits ... Pst he is talking about packets 
....
Damn do you like switching hz to seconds ...  Well i dont mind 
Let me try i like seconds per joul why not talk in these terms?
...
You are doing a video representation ... Yes you can show a pixel let me introduce tou to scaling used on maps since 2 dudes in france and their offspring
 1:500000 should show anything you want to show"
6891,qs2QcycggWU,I might sound salty... But i stand by what i wrote
6892,qs2QcycggWU,This beamforming and beam steering is also the fundamental working principles in 5G.
6893,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, McFlatface is SO much more complicated than I could have ever imagined ....totally mind boggling would be an understatement !!"
6894,qs2QcycggWU,A whole lot of amazing technologies wrap up into meme…🤣 mind blowing!
6895,qs2QcycggWU,"12ghz ac... hmm... think about that... ALL components (solder, etc) better be either super high quality and exceptionally tolerant to heat, or all super cheap and inexpensive to replace. a dish (active dish, not passive) moreover, working that hard in all kinds of environments.. i just dont see it lasting longer than 2 years.. like the LNB on traditional sat dishes. and its energy cost will be enormous in com[parison."
6896,qs2QcycggWU,"ehm..  ""TV satellites"" are in geo-stationary orbit. Your animation have the earth and the satellite in opposing rotations and not even in synchronised.  Sorry fellah. less than 3 mins in and credability is zero. From a channel with ""education"" in is name .....sorry , trust is zero. down thumb"

6935,qs2QcycggWU,"As a satcom engineer with over 40 years of experience in the field, I can say that you did a really good job of distilling this information down to something a layperson can grasp.  Well done.  

I would point out that in addition to receive only satellite TV antennas that communicate with geostationary satellites, there are also two way antennas that communicate to GSO satellites as well, along with other variants which provided two way communications with other non-geostationary satellite networks in different orbits."

_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth.

6940,qs2QcycggWU,"RideGasGas, thanks for your comment.  Glad to know there are few old guys still interested in this stuff.  I first worked on analog computers in nuclear bombers 55 years ago.  It wasn't until 37 years ago, though, that I got the chance to work in computer data communications for a large telecom.  As a sys tech in a major data center, I was disappointed that their tech was so old school in the late '80s.  All the computer data connections were via RS-232c (25 pair) cable.  It wasn't until the very late '80s and early '90s that they began using TCP/IP and RJ-45 in house.  Even then, it took them many years to replace everything.  By then, I had retired.  You'd laugh at the punch cards and paper tape we used  on some minicomputers to load data.  LOL!   All that was from a center where we monitored datacom from several mainframes, 2,000 minicomputers, and around 30,000 servers on a WAN that covered 9 U.S. states."
6941,qs2QcycggWU,"Would you mind taking a look at this? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwfO_bOeQU"
6942,qs2QcycggWU,@@ron.v this is always the case businesses grow organically and witgout a plan of the whole garden soon becomes a wild mess. Unfortunatly putting a rotorvator tgrough it all and replacing it is rarely an option. The cost of maintaining a legacy system while running up a new replacement (modern technology) system is unfortunatly something few financial directors are willing to pay. Even when it is by far the best option. So 95% of your time is spent fire fighting existing issues and 5% trying to work up a replacement peicemeal. The compromises that have to be made then usually cripple the updated parts of the system and bring few improvments for many years. Which then get picked on by director level people who have no understanding of modern systems (thay frequently having set up the old ones and usually do not want to see their work retired by something they then do not understand) lol. Oh the joys of IT polatics.
6943,qs2QcycggWU,"@@williamarmstrong7199  Very well explained.  I watched the same things happen in the steel industry where my father, uncles, and brother worked.  The leaders milk the old tech for all it's worth then do exactly as you said.  It has nothing to do with whether the new tech is better and everything to do with whether investors get an immediate return on investment.  Start ups almost always do better because they have no out-of-date investment to deal with. 

What amazes me is how existing companies can misjudge new tech when they could have profited from it big time.  Examples are how the founder of Digital Eqpt. said,  “There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home"" and how Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center literally gave away the GUI and mouse, etc. because their corporate leaders didn't recognize their value."
6944,qs2QcycggWU,Are there any safety concerns mounting dishy above a living space?
6945,qs2QcycggWU,"@@scottferguson527 SpaceX filed a radio frequency exposure analysis as part of their application to the FCC far a blanket license to operate Dishy and the newer rectangular version.  Both antennas are well below both the FCC and international limits for exposure. 

Keep in mind that the antennas radiate power up in a narrow beam, so there is very little power behind the antenna or off to the sides.  Also, at these frequencies there is very high attenuation of the radio frequency energy by the housing materials between the antenna and the living quarters inside.  Even a normal dual pane window provides quite a bit of attention at these frequencies.  This is one of the reasons Verizon’s 28 GHz 5G service is struggling."
6946,qs2QcycggWU,"@@ron.v While I never actually programmed a computer with punch cards, I have carted hundreds of pounds of them to the trash.  I worked as a janitor in high school at a Western Electric plant in Millard Nebraska.  They used to load trash cans full of them which were then really hard to lift.  At my first job after the Army (where I got started as a satcom tech) we programmed IBM mainframe via CRTs and keyboards so between 1975 and 1981 the punch cards went away.  I learned System 370 assembly language, JCL (more like DOS batch file than an actual language), and APL.  Fun stuff."
6947,qs2QcycggWU,"@@RideGasGas  Thanks so much for sharing that.  I always wondered when the punch cards went away.  The only JCL I learned in school was enough for our Fortran jobs to run on the 370.  Those jobs were on punch cards during the spring quarter of 1980.  I didn't actually learn the tech behind it until Bellsouth promoted me from my job in supply to a system specialist (tier-2 support) in '85.  Most of our systems (2,000 of them by the late '90s) were AT&T UNIX minicomputers but one of the systems we supported was an app on a mainframe.  All used CRTs as you said. 

When I was in the USAF in the late '60s we supported analog computer hardware and one early digital system  In school '79-'84, I learned BASIC, PL1, and Fortran but on the job '85-'04 what little programming we needed was in shell scripts.  Nothing was compiled.  Our jobs focused on system support at the OS level.  It included datacom and front-end processors.  Your stuff was probably a lot more fun.  Ours was hands-on at first.  That was the most fun 'til we went remote in the early '90s."
6948,qs2QcycggWU,@@ron.v I worked at Magavox and the engineers in the tv design came up with remote design to tv's.. One of department heads squashed the idea  he felt the customers would not use it....  It was One year ahead of any tv on the market. Took two years to catch up after that.
6949,qs2QcycggWU,"@@johnw9585 Thanks for sharing your experience with Magnavox.  I  once read a book called ""Fumbling the Future"" about how Xerox's CEO told his Palo Alto Research  Center (PARC) that their inventions of the mouse and GUI were silly because no one would want a computer in their home.  Sometimes it seems executives are a couple French fries short of a Happy Meal."
6950,qs2QcycggWU,Can you receive tv channels and satellite channels and is a box required
6951,qs2QcycggWU,"@@mariogarza7796 Not a Starlink user, but my understanding is that it provides a connection to the Internet.  You'll be able to watch TV without any extra hardware to the extent that you have a computing device that can connect to an Internet streaming service that has the desired channels available.  For example Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, and others have bundles where you can get popular TV and movie services and pay one bill.  The alternative would be to subscribe to them ala carte.

This is different than a DISH or DirecTV satellite offering which are designed from the ground up as a broadcast TV service and require a receiver box.  Since DirecTV was acquired by AT&T I think they are pushing to deliver more of their services via fiber and other land-based methods and are bundling both Internet and TV together, or so I heard."
6952,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown....thousands of hrs work is explained efficiently in an single video....thx BE
6953,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciate!!
6954,qs2QcycggWU,19:26 it's ok if The contractive and Destructive Pattern is only one but in reality there is lots of dark and bright fringes or beams  so what happens to other un directed beam to un proper location
6955,qs2QcycggWU,They just go out into the space.  But it's possible to reduce these side lobes by having different powers sent to antennas along the edge.

You mean ..
 Any beam Generally spread in space by Inverse-square law so over distance it spread to many undesired location so only tiny amount reached to the receiving end 
Mean Inefficient or signal loss 
But on the other hand ...
If we use Wave interference than the wave not only Focus but they also became seprate parallel beams just like in Double slit Experiment we can see dark and Light patterns so overall all darkside beam combines to Bright side and adding up the Intensity of the signal by Constructive and Destructive manner interferences ,  otherwise same signal have to pass by filling all its wavefront plane right ?"
6966,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah.  It's rather counter intuitive, but having destructive interference somewhere means that the constructive interference elsewhere is more powerful."
6967,qs2QcycggWU,More of this please  !
6968,qs2QcycggWU,Will do!
6969,qs2QcycggWU,Basically the aperture couple patch antenna is a capacitor that allows higher frequency through. am i getting that right?
6970,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah- that's definitely an acceptable interpretation.
6971,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation Def earned my subscription for responding
6972,qs2QcycggWU,Just awesome
6973,qs2QcycggWU,"14:25 wow so it's the great application of Double slit Experiment and interference because we can't use lenses to focus we need somthing clever like this  , Awesome technology"
6974,qs2QcycggWU,I am blown away by this technology
6975,qs2QcycggWU,13:09 Oh so it's same antenna which is found in 5g ?
6976,qs2QcycggWU,Uses similar principles as 5G
6977,qs2QcycggWU,"Why there is square Cut in the Top Antena ?
Is it Cavity resonator or some kind of filter ?
And does it also have old school LC , LNA filters ?"
6978,qs2QcycggWU,Can you explain how the side lobes form.
6979,qs2QcycggWU,"Incredibly well-made video.

One question: does the satellite aso do beam-forming in order to speak to each Dishy antenna individually, or does the satellite transmit more in a broadcasting way?"
6980,qs2QcycggWU,Yes- the satellite has similar beamforming antenna arrays.
6981,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation Yes, but does the satellite target each Dishy individually, or does it just use beam forming to target a specific area of earth?"
6982,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz The satellites would have to ''flood'' the earth I guess. As the earth wobbles and shakes around, the gps satellites have to flood because of that. We will be exposed like never before. not good imo."

6984,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz A familiar, civilian version of what happens can be read into by taking a look at what ""MIMO"" is, in the context of modern 802.11 wifi. I'll try to remember to come back and expand this (mobile; typing >>> swyping for this kind of writing). I'm case I do not, or if you wanted to start exploring, here's a quick topic dump and tldr. 

Phased arrays can create one powerful main lobe, but multiple main lobes of lesser strength is also possible. Clients are assigned timeslots and several clients are targeted at once. This is actually a way to harness side lobes somewhat. Rather than suppress one, augment and steer it a bit if it was already near enough to be in direction of a client. 

As for how the information is modulated so that it is meaningful to multiple discrete clients at the same time, check out a thing called OFDMA. It is fucking wild."
6985,qs2QcycggWU,@@MoritzvonSchweinitz it has to target each dishy
6986,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 Thank you! I learned a lot, I think!

So it's basically an in-between? Intead of focusing on just one Dishy at a time, a special hedgehog-shape is generated which beams to multiple Dishys at once, and the pattern is then changed to beam at a Different set of Dishys?"
6987,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz  Satellites don't exist. GPS not working in ocean. GPS is just the triangulation of cell towers. Internet cables are buried under the ocean. Time to wake up. Trust your senses..
_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth. There is a treaty signed by 50 countries that no man can get to Antarctica, because it's the surrounding wall of our flat earth, and it extends very far."
6988,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once again😁 solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
6989,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz If earth goes around the sun making an elliptic path, then we should have 2 summer and 2 winter in 1 year. But in reality, sun circles above our flat earth closer to north making smaller circle in April may , so it's summer for north countries and winter for australia the same month. In December, sun makes bigger circle close to australia, so summer there and winter for north countries. It makes perfect sense. EARTH IS FLAT. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE NEVER EXISTED.
 _ some other globers say earth is revolving in a circular path with off centered sun, then you got huge problem, for some months sun should be huge in size and very small for other months. But in reality sun appears the same size for all 12 months in a year. Busted again.
_ other globe fools say earth is tilted. pathetic. Make up your minds."
6990,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz If earth and atmosphere spin 1600 KMph in the eastward direction, then flights traveling west at max speed 1000 KMph, must be having hard time to cruise and would never reach its westward destination. But in real life scenario, flights reach the destinations between A and B at the same duration regardless of the direction. This one fact alone is enough to prove that the earth is NOT a spinning ball, but rather a flat disk.. Globe model is illuminati deception, and it's been busted.. checkmate.."
6991,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Do not trust these science clowns, they are hiding God from us. They have no evidence for a spinning ball earth. We are living on this Jesus-created flat earth for this whole time. If you dare , research the shape of our earth, you will be shocked."
6992,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz No curvature evidence, no spinning evidence, no Antarctica circumnavigation, releasing fake cgi images, yet they are yelling that we are traveling on a stupid ball with high pressure air rubbing against vacuum. What a pathetic bunch of losers. Their cognitive dissonance won't let them realize that earth is flat and non-moving.
_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic. Shame on those who believe globe earth nonsense, globers keep whining but still they don't have a single proof that earth is flying, spinning, or having curvature. 2022 is the year of waking up."
6993,qs2QcycggWU,@@Almighty_Flat_Earth I hope you are kidding/trolling?
6994,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz Yes in that you are grasping the idea well. No in that it's always more complex than that. So, right now, where client density is pretty sparse, it will basically always be like that. Multiple individuals targeted each with their own lobe.

You could imagine a scenario in the future where multiple Dishys are in close enough proximity that Starlink could decide that the tradeoff (in terms of its own resource utilization: a combination of time and power etc) makes sense to schedule some TxOps with a slightly less laserlike, more conical lobe because that will cover those clients all at once more efficiently than the individual lobe route.

As another followup, if you get into some of this, much is made these days of OFDMA in context of 802.11ax, and how it will be the killer feature, and how MIMO (aka MU-MIMO) has been kind of a disappointment for wifi. Interestingly, the reason for this is that even the top end 8x8 radios are pretty coarse in their ability to beamform. Whereas Starlink, the MIMO-like aspect is doing a lot more of the heavy lifting than OFDMA. Just something I thought was interesting regarding the discourse.

edit: Clarity. To make explicit what I left to the imagination, yes, these things can be done together. So you could get ""hedghog"" patterns (love it) where all the quills are the sharpest type and the maximum number; hedgehogs where some of the quills are a touch thicker than others, but still some are the thin ones; or any variety you can imagine. 

Also, any time there is literally only one client in a beam, and this is still a little simplified and also depends on exactly how SpaceX designed the revision of Starlink in question, then essentially OFDMA doesn't do any of the heavy lifting in terms of allocating resources and isolating comms, and it's all the beamforming (""MIMO"") side. And any time clients do any beam sharing, OFDMA gets in."
6995,qs2QcycggWU,"@@JoshWalker1 this is all so incredible! I have problems ""groking"" even a simple antenna pattern, and the voodoo priests that are RF engineers are doing all of that crazy stuff.

Do you know by any chance how many ""quills"" are feasible per phased array? I imagine the calculations needed to generate a specific hedgehog pattern would get exponentially more complex?"
6996,qs2QcycggWU,"@@MoritzvonSchweinitz You're thinking the right way about it. So, at some point, computational complexity would be a limiting factor, even if everything else going on would permit additional quills. 

""Everything else"" includes things like, for example, what is just possible at all, as a matter of beamforming because of the physics of it -- you can imagine an array with 1280 elements has limitations that an array of 2560 (etc) would not run into. And the intensity* of each quill needs to be comfortably above the background noise. Simultaneous quills must naturally share the power output of the array. 

[*So, not sharpness, as that's our metaphor for more and less pinpoint-targeted lobes; rather, the amount of power sent into that lobe. One solo quill can get the whole of the array's power, and such a signal can be seen in even relatively adverse environments; think, jamming attempts in the context of Dishys deployed in Ukraine, say.]

Additionally, taking some of our knowledge here a layer deeper, at the expense of the metaphor a bit, using all the array elements to form one main lobe? That is the most focused the beam can be. Creating multiple beams means they will, all of them, be duller/blunter/less focused/you get the idea I hope. If 1280 elements can create a tightness of focus of [X], creating 4 otherwise identical beams simultaneously would work out to be, in terms of the beam,  analogous to that which could be made by a system with the same engineering and architecture and only 320 elements. (This is not quite right and the video itself alludes to the existence of some factors that scale a bit superlinearly but it's not wildly important now.)

So note then, there's two penalties in terms of delivering a clear signal to a target when you send multiple quills. The power is already shared between them, *and* the cross-sectional area is larger. 

(Bonus: You might notice the penalty from the former looks like it scales linearly, whereas the latter at least quadratically. As such, not exact figures but to convey the idea: You could imagine a tradeoff where 1 to 4 or so Dishys in close proximity get individual dwells, but 5+ in the same area is a tipping point where it would save resources to create one larger dwell, just in terms of delivering received power intensity.)

Hopefully this tickles your brain better than the more literal answer to your question, which wouldn't be possible to provide without making use of non-public information (which, even if one had access to it, would be a big no-no)."

7007,qs2QcycggWU,Congrats. It was excellent with minimal errors. I've worked on SATCOM for 20 years and went straight to 1.5x. Video is fanstatic. Loved that you covered QAM. Typically QAM is reserved for terestrial lines like coax which is 256 QAM. The signal to space is usually too dirty but the low orbit makes it possible. Typical SATCOM to geostationary satellites run QPSK or 8PSK.
7008,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!

7031,qs2QcycggWU,"So if the phased array is beamforming towards the satellites by changing the phase of the antennas respective to each other, and we're encoding different bit patterns by also phase shifting (+amplitude changes), does that mean the two phase shifts have to somehow be calculated to account for each other either at the sending or receiving side?"

7035,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent presentation!  25 years ago this was Classified technology used on phased-array RADAR systems that could scan the sky in 360 degrees thousands of times a second and could see a bird 20 miles away.  This technology is still in use today on Navel vessels and by NORAD to scan the skies.  If you look you can see them as very large circular or hexagon shaped pads on the sides of the ship.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Phased_Array_Radar

A VERY simplified version of this, phase-steerable antenna systems, have been used by ham radio operators for years but they are limited in resolution to only several degrees."
7036,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks for the additional info!!  Perhaps someday I'll dive more into phased array radar.
7037,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation The principle is virtually identical to StarLink but steered much more quickly and with much higher resolution.  Usually it's at around 24GHz-36GHz.  Much higher and you get into atmospheric absorption of the signals (usually oxygen and water vapor); lower bands limit the resolution.

How can a satellite with only a few phased-array transmitter antenna 'download' to some hundreds of customers simultaneously?  Is it 'steering' toward each 'dishy' in a round-robin method?  Or just broadcasting to a swath of ground under it?   How does my 'dishy' separate my download signal from my neighbors just a few hundred feet away?

He will continue to do well and I will continue to listen to him more. You can just put his name on google and you will be directed to his website and drop him your messages.
7112,qs2QcycggWU,"its amazing to understand, invent and design systems like that - but its also a feat to brake it down for normal people to understand! thanks"
7113,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely fantastic quality and information ease of consumption
7114,qs2QcycggWU,I have a friend that believes the Earth is flat and space stuff is fake. He would try and pick this video apart with his kindergarten thinking. Sad really.
7115,qs2QcycggWU,An insane amount of work went into this production. Well done! Thanks.
7116,qs2QcycggWU,awesome!
7117,qs2QcycggWU,great video
7118,qs2QcycggWU,if phase change is used to transmit data then does it not interfer with the phase change used for direction?
7119,qs2QcycggWU,"If possible please make a video on LIGO or LHC….
btw content and presentation is topnotch."
7120,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video! I miss the part about Starlink ground stations, though."
7121,qs2QcycggWU,splendid tech shits!
7122,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent discussion
7123,qs2QcycggWU,"This is so cool
It made me cry 😭 ❤️ aww man ❤️ this is freaking amazing 😭❤️"
7124,qs2QcycggWU,"Hang on this very similar to one of Tesla's free energy machines the one way where it bounces waves off the ionosphere, and they come back with more energy than they left with, the size difference would be like comparing a pea to a planet"
7125,qs2QcycggWU,"The explanation is crazy well illustrated, oh my ! What a quality content. Thanks for covering the Starlink dish."
7126,qs2QcycggWU,I can see this every night as the airplanes send to drones to which send to my fuckinbroom silencing my neighborhood it's so fuckin quiet. Literally can see the frequency transmission beams over and over. Moo. Is fake
7127,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. Thanks for explaining it in detail. Had one question, What really happens at the satellite end while transmitting? Since many dishes are receiving the the data from a single satellite, how the beam is steered? How is it able to serve so many dishes with just two antennas?"
7128,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely blown away by the research and the show u guys have made ... amazing..thank you so much for such content...
7129,qs2QcycggWU,WOW 😮 🤯 Excellent Channel
7130,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content
7131,qs2QcycggWU,Engagement comment
7132,qs2QcycggWU,Very very interesting and great informaiton :)
7133,qs2QcycggWU,thats a whole new level of understanding for me
7134,qs2QcycggWU,That was awesome. İnsanely detailed.
7135,qs2QcycggWU,Went to school and back for a whole in the duration of this video. Amazing content!!
7136,qs2QcycggWU,It is incredible to see how multiple subjects of engineering have been compressed in this and explained flawlessly.
7137,qs2QcycggWU,So you're telling me satellites work because nerds?
7138,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video as always ♥️♥️♥️ I didn't understand the 64qam part though, I don't get how is it possible to choose the code sent by changing the phase, doesn't this affect the steering too?"
7139,qs2QcycggWU,Really good
7140,qs2QcycggWU,"The idea that phase array multiplies the total energy is false, they still radiate all around them, the strength is multiplied in one direction and all of the spherical radiation is wasted. You lose power in total but get one strong beam out of it. Also, the destructive interference pattern is not full, we get plenty of secondary beams... that can be used to monitor your internet traffic."
7141,qs2QcycggWU,"great video, great info!   subbed."
7142,qs2QcycggWU,The only reason I even understood some of this was because I had to learn about radio frequencies and antenna for Fpv drones. This is so cool😁
7143,qs2QcycggWU,"Thus is as good as it can geton youtube. Nothing can surpass the type of ""class"" except interactive in real life. These interesting topics paired with the amount of video & voice& content, research etc. Great channel!"
7144,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing technology just as amazing as the teacher who is branch education. Amazing work to help better our understanding.
7145,qs2QcycggWU,Need More Videos like this!🔥
7146,qs2QcycggWU,"The video mentions H.264, which requires 5 Mbit/s for HD quality. One way to alleviate congestion of Starlink could be to have a cache on Dishy that downloads the videos that the user is subscribed to in YouTube when the network is less loaded. It could maybe detect users sharing interests in a given area and broadcast the data, instead of sending it individually."
7147,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are just awesome .
7148,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing ! Congrats guys.
7149,qs2QcycggWU,Reminds me of Morse code sent radio freq waves only at a much higher speed and with more significant gain antennas.
7150,qs2QcycggWU,Your videos are simply amazing... thank you for your hard work.
7151,qs2QcycggWU,Very good explanation! Thank you!
7152,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation!
7153,qs2QcycggWU,The quality of this video is amazing 👏
7154,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink is a mess for all scientist.  no one has given permission to pollute the orbit like this. hopefully the dirt will burn up soon musk is an arogant decadent idiot
7155,qs2QcycggWU,This is remarkable.   I now have a bleed on the brain.  Great explanation!
7156,qs2QcycggWU,"The quality of this video is just nuts. Great, great job!"
7157,qs2QcycggWU,"I am currently studying electronic engineering, and I am proud of the field. I understood majority of the discussed topics, this is definitely not a layman video. However, you made it extremely more understandable to the layman."
7158,qs2QcycggWU,More videos please!!
7159,qs2QcycggWU,"Big respect for your channel, very informative and educational, not to mention very cool animations ❤❤❤❤ keep it up"
7160,qs2QcycggWU,nice vid
7161,qs2QcycggWU,WOW! Just WOW! 🤔😮😲😯 🤩
7162,qs2QcycggWU,Good content
7163,qs2QcycggWU,So grateful for the creators of this video
7164,qs2QcycggWU,Blown away by the technology in Starlink! Great animation work btw
7165,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing! Thank you for making the best tech content on YouTube!
7166,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, only comment is that i looks a bit strange that a geostationary satellite for tv transmission flies/rotates to opposite way as the earth :P"
7167,qs2QcycggWU,I know the guy who invented that antenna.
7168,qs2QcycggWU,I am blone away it is so amazing and awesome
7169,qs2QcycggWU,"Well you are never to old to learn something. Although some of this was way above my pea brain I still understand it. Now I know how my Starlink works in theory.
I thank you for this video very much. 
I am also a Ham Radio Extra Class holder. So the part with the phased antennas hit home as I run them hear at home on 2 meters and 1.2 CM...  Again Thank you.."
7170,qs2QcycggWU,"i don't know what's more breathtaking here: engineering behind Starlink technology (rather: combination of old ideas like beamforming stuffed into one pair of devices) or amount of simplifications contained herein allowing majority to understand concepts while not ommiting interesting details allowing to actually understand concepts' principles. 
No to forget visuals without which understanding interferences would be much harder. Great work!"
7171,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video. It's mind boggling to me how so many antennas are so precisely coordinated. I suppose the lengths of all the pcb traces from the control chips to the antennas need to be accounted for.  How would such precision be achieved? It only takes a few picoseconds for current to travel one cm.
7172,qs2QcycggWU,Algorithm comment
7173,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful
7174,qs2QcycggWU,Great video folks.  Your efforts are very much appreciated.
7175,qs2QcycggWU,"You guys are awesome 👏🏻, continue to make these videos, A great help for the community, I bagged an Internship at micron just by watching your 3D NAND Videos, now working on next generation NAND Devices."
7176,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for making this video. This is really amazing!!! Best animations ever !!!
7177,qs2QcycggWU,"Can I get this dishy if I'm in South Africa 🇿🇦, I'd like to buy one."
7178,qs2QcycggWU,Imagine what would happen if every telco company would deploy ten thousands satellites around the globe….

7184,qs2QcycggWU,"This tech is blowing my mind every few minutes into the video. The way they use constructive interference and phase shift to change the angle! That must be a known older trick, does anyone else use that?"
7185,qs2QcycggWU,"its was to expensive to use it in ""home stuff"".... now with the bump from Elon -- its not )"
7186,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video!
7187,qs2QcycggWU,"Please, don't get discouraged by low number of views on the video, sooner the world will be demanding in depth knowledge of things around us. And at that time no one will be around this channel."
7188,qs2QcycggWU,I bet there no other video on entire internet explaining it better than this one
7189,qs2QcycggWU,is starlink the only internet providing satellite?
7190,qs2QcycggWU,Using this tech (with fast speeds) only two -- Starlink USA for home users and OneWeb UK-India-Japan for companies and mobile operators.
7191,qs2QcycggWU,@@tvguide4khv Thanks man
7192,qs2QcycggWU,"I like these kind of detailed videos, where everything is explained in much more detail and depth"
7193,qs2QcycggWU,"Great content.  Subscribed!  If you need help with modeling or animation, please let me know.  It looks like you're using Blender from what I could tell.  Really well done.  I've been modeling for 10 years, and is one of the few things I can still do, due to physical limitations."
7194,qs2QcycggWU,I am stunned by the technology of Starlink and equally stunned that there is a video delivery technology that can deliver this video to me for free. I would love to see a video explaining how the business model behind Starlink and the production of all of its components has a chance at working. It seems impossible economically.

7196,qs2QcycggWU,Having the CIA as a partner doesn't hurt!
7197,qs2QcycggWU,"Definitely impossible economically as it’s currently standing, the hit will come when enough people are reliant upon it"
7198,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is a part of SpaceX, so as SpaceX launches the satellites on its own it are the cheapest launches currently possible in relation to payload mass, though it is still very costly. The production cost of the satellites is not bublicly known."
7199,qs2QcycggWU,"Yep, this is the one channel that definitely deserves all the likes and subs possible"
7200,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation via beautiful animation
7201,qs2QcycggWU,Unfortunately due to the limited bandwidth only a limited number of users in each user cell can access the satellite at one time. This is fine in rural or remote regions of low population but not in larger urban regions. Even Elon Musk stated that Starlink was aimed at mainly these rural and remote users that have little or limited internet accessibility.  In the cities you can bet it's only the government and financial institutions that will access the satellites while the rest of us get by on fibre optic or landline based communications for internet.
7202,qs2QcycggWU,"Given the microwave frequencies, is the power level harmful to someone in front of the antenna beam?"
7203,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for another immensely accessible and painstakingly well thought out video. They are all worth more than one viewing and are simply some of the best educational content I've seen so far.
7204,qs2QcycggWU,"For a more balanced perspective, view the Youtube video ""Debunking Starlink"". Many aspects of this technology are not sustainable."

7208,qs2QcycggWU,"I have Starlink, am an engineer, and YOU SCHOOLED ME! EXCELLENT VIDEO!!! Well done, subscribed."
7209,qs2QcycggWU,"Y'all can keep simping for Musk. Starlink will never become 100% and it's a money burner. 

You ask why? 40k satellite? Life time is 10 years? Lol lol lol"
7210,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely mind blowing
7211,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video 👍
7212,qs2QcycggWU,"awesome, I love this channel because every time I realize how dumb I am."
7213,qs2QcycggWU,So the world isn't flat?
7214,qs2QcycggWU,mind = thoroughly blown
7215,qs2QcycggWU,Wonderful video! I really enjoy this content. you have my subscription
7216,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
7217,qs2QcycggWU,"As a mechanical engineer with antenna design experience you did a great job describing the whole process of transmitting and receiving a phased array microwave signal. RF is pretty tough to develop and tends to have a mind of its own. Lots of tweaking involved but once you have it all ""dialed-in"" your Goldie Locks as long as the design is stable unit to unit. Great video, subscribed!"
7218,qs2QcycggWU,Already hit 2x speed gang.
7219,qs2QcycggWU,Superbly explained - even I could understand it!
7220,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the lecture.
7221,qs2QcycggWU,"Simply amazing!!! I'm using Starlink dishes as a backup for remote locations and I'm really amazed about the quality, stability, delay, jitter, packet loss ... this system pays back each dollar you invest  on it. Starlink type of satellite Internet service is the future, even with a chance to replace a fiber link in some cases"
7222,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown 🤯
7223,qs2QcycggWU,Very well done! This is what happens when you replace laziness with doing the learning people. New incredible creations to take people into the future.
7224,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is inaccurate within the first 13 seconds. How could anyone possibly trust the rest?

7227,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi Branch Education, 
that was very good. 

If you make it, I would like nothing more than an 
explanatory video about how the Starlink satellites 
build their local network. 

How they maintain their local neighborhood network. 
How they bring a new Saiellite into their local 
network and let another one out. 

How each satellite aligns its Laser Communication 
Units (how many LCUs does each satellite have?) 
with its neighbors (how many neighbors does a 
satellite have?) and what information it needs to 
send a long signal sequence to a dishy and then, 
if necessary, pass that signal sequence on to 
a neighboring satellite. 

So what is the signal path of a long sequence 
from a base station on earth to a user somewhere 
on earth and from there back to the base station.

How does it come about, how is it preserved?"
7228,qs2QcycggWU,excellent
7229,qs2QcycggWU,10 minutes in and I'm LOST LOL
7230,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing content!  🥰🇨🇦🇺🇸
7231,qs2QcycggWU,comment!
7232,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe you guys modeled and animated this all out. Very educational stuff.
7233,qs2QcycggWU,Nicely done.  Thanks for all the research and polishing.
7234,qs2QcycggWU,This is hands down the best educational YouTube video I have seen. Thank you so much for creating this video. I have EE background and man.. It’s amazing.. really. Thank you. Thank you
7235,qs2QcycggWU,Dang this is cool
7236,qs2QcycggWU,BS1😤
7237,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing details and excellent efforts on taking complex processes and making them understandable. I knew when my Dishy arrived and I plugged it in, the hardware was light years beyond anything I'd seen before. Now that I know it's even more elaborate than I could ever imagine, I'm going to pay homage by watching Netflix and not focus on how it works."
7238,qs2QcycggWU,"Really love this video I had to watch it 3 times!
Great job branch education!
I Really absorb some knowledge!
Thanks"
7239,qs2QcycggWU,The technology and explanation are both supreme
7240,qs2QcycggWU,Great presentation... Guess this explains why the antenna cost so much... Interested in knowing how the antenna used in an airplane is configured & sized...
7241,qs2QcycggWU,These gadgets are EXACTLY the same as I was trying to build with my Legos when I was eleven!
7242,qs2QcycggWU,Fascinating! Excellent! Hurrah!
7243,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blown.
Any info with regards to blockchain?"
7244,qs2QcycggWU,"That's heck of a lot of information in such a short video, nice job"
7245,qs2QcycggWU,most RF technology is basically magic

7247,qs2QcycggWU,PERFECT! THX!
7248,qs2QcycggWU,"that clarified me not only starlink, also other antennas; thanks!"
7249,qs2QcycggWU,"this channel should have atleast 20m subscribers, now i know why there's crowd in parlours and not in libraries"
7250,qs2QcycggWU,"Unbelievably clear explanation of several complex technologies.
I feel enlightened!"
7251,qs2QcycggWU,I'm mind blown by this fascinating full of simple information YouTube video
7252,qs2QcycggWU,"I think the most impressive part of the video is at 6:55 where they properly model electricity around a wire. Since most don’t know that current and charge , which is a lot of what electricity is to my understanding, actually occurs in a field around a conductor. When asked with how does power go through a cable most think it travels inside the metal conductor which is not entirely false as electrons do still bounce off atoms in one direction depending on the charge."
7253,qs2QcycggWU,excellent explanation!
7254,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video
7255,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7256,qs2QcycggWU,"waw i have never seen anything explained so comprehensively well! you are very good. i did'nt follow the advice of doing it in two shot of different higher speed, but i gawked at the idea of the proposition xD thank you very much. 
In the dark age of influencers, you are upping youtube's meaningfulness"
7257,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video quality! Well done! I can imagine the deep technical knowledge and research done behind the video, but still kept it simple and understandable yet for the everyday person. Bravo."
7258,qs2QcycggWU,"trees block wifi because they say your signal sucks, wrap access points around their trunks and get global wifi and plug in by wire around tree internet ... TADA"
7259,qs2QcycggWU,using wires arond trees one could broacst internet around the world .. using a wire around any tree one could have internet anywhere ...
7260,qs2QcycggWU,"Next level mix of visuals and in-depth explanations, bravo! The only thing I’d say is off is that electrons don’t travel as fast in the conductors as your visuals suggest when we go on picoseconds scale, electric field however does transmit change of potential at the speed of light."
7261,qs2QcycggWU,Great explanation... I always wondered how they keep track of satellites.
7262,qs2QcycggWU,"I grew up watching The Discovery Channel back when it was...well, about discovery. Now that media is moving in a different direction I've always wondered how and if kids now a days will get a fair chance at being exposed to science in an engaging way, and I must say this video does not disappoint."

Slave Species, Will Receive Their Orders, Anywhere on Earth  😛"
7264,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome animated explanation. Thanks
7265,qs2QcycggWU,Antidote
7266,qs2QcycggWU,How does the satellite point to many dishes at once?
7267,qs2QcycggWU,"Thing is it does not need, client fishes need that to be low power, while satellites have a lot more power so they can just send stronger signal, same as tv satellites signal feeding large land surface. It for not use directional antennas, it also not require to use beam forming, but it technically could use that to optimize signal distribution by satelite dishes sending gps coordinate, as explained in video dish has gps and it knows where it is. In fact there proof it actually does that as they block of service when you move dish too far from your home. So signal spreads like a dome and an be received from any point in range of signal. 
On single signal, you can send data to multiple devices via multiplexing, by giving air time for specific device target it and switch between them, data is addressed so receiver knows it should decode this data not other one. this is basic concept used in most wireless technologies, wifi, cell network, thats also how digital tv let you have multiple channels same frequency and why digital tv can have more channels overall. The same thing in cables, like ethernet, router simply directs forward data to right device or to another router or switch to distribute data feather. So it a concept used in communication technologiesoverall."
7268,qs2QcycggWU,"@@ShadowriverUB Nice, thanks."
7269,qs2QcycggWU,"Sub'd, liked & commented - well done!"
7270,qs2QcycggWU,Thx for explaining starlink. It brought back memories of when i was in electronics school way back in the 70's. I was wondering though... why was the dish changed from round to rectangular?
7271,qs2QcycggWU,great content.   just brilliant

I have subscribed to the channel and I am going to check out Brilliant.

Can you describe please, are the satellites rotating up there, or spinning on an axis somehow?
I am wondering about the ""mechanics"" of why we see them ""flare"" up there in the night sky when they go by sometimes.

Thank you very much."
7288,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing🔥 How much electricital power is needed for the antenna to send one bit?
7289,qs2QcycggWU,"Re: “Don't Let DISH Disable Your Internet - VoterVoice.” Around July 6, Elon tweeted that Dish’s excessive hoarding of 12GHz channels will kill Starlink (& revenues needed to sustain SpaceX/Starships). How is that going?"

7295,qs2QcycggWU,"This is the best explanation of phased array antennas that I have ever seen, especially from a layman's point of view.  Great job!"
7296,qs2QcycggWU,It feels like I actually understood something rather than in some discovery channel documentary about any physical/technological topic where they simplify so much that you can't really understand it and they interview a dozen scientists making emotional statements about how marvelous and mysterious it all is.
7297,qs2QcycggWU,"Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once again😁 solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
7298,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing thing about this video, is it explains what  defence departments around the world spend so much money on. The amount of effort in phased array applications in electronic warfare are insane!!! Billions and billions of $$"
7299,qs2QcycggWU,AT & T ARCHIVES -A 20 YEAR HISTORY OF ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILES - from 1962 will show phased array radar using a multiplicity of microprocessors to track and intercept all missiles with 100% accuracy - this tech is 60 years old // AS A FORMER HOG FARMER IM SURPRISED HOW WELL THEY DUPLICATED A 60 YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY

Great work...and I love that dedication ❤️"
7305,qs2QcycggWU,I did the mistake of watching this full video in the normal speed instead of the advised fast forward speed and my brain is overloaded. But I seriously enjoyed it. One question I have is if a phase shift is introduced in the QAM stage and other phase shift during the beamform steering stage then how are the two phase shifts are recognised?? Won't they just combine together and like mess up the signal?? Is it possible that the signal transmitted also contains the information of the phase shift which is then received and then phase shift is reversed according to the info received??
7306,qs2QcycggWU,The phase shifts combine but they combine in a way that is understandable. The phase shifts in QAM are separated by time and the phase shifts in the array are separated by space. Care has to be taken so that things do not interfere with each other. There are complicated rules that prevent signal from one time frame to not interfere with the signals of other time frames. Similarly the shift on each tiny antenna needs to be calculated precisely to prevent them from canceling each other's signal.
7307,qs2QcycggWU,Despite you continuing to call it that annoying name. Its not a good or cool name. its stupid and lame. good video
7308,qs2QcycggWU,"Haha.  Part of the reason is because 'Dishy' is shorter than saying 'the Satellite Dish' or 'the Dish'  thus saving time.  When you have a 28min video with of all text, ya save time where you can."
7309,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video
7310,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you very much!

7319,qs2QcycggWU,Glad you're enjoying it!
7320,qs2QcycggWU,What a beautiful work you've done! Thank you so much.
7321,qs2QcycggWU,Our pleasure!
7322,qs2QcycggWU,This is an excellent presentation to explain a very complex technology.  Thank you.
7323,qs2QcycggWU,You're very welcome!
7324,qs2QcycggWU,"I dont know how to thank you Branch Education, for providing such extreme high quality informative videos!"
7325,qs2QcycggWU,Glad you like them!
7326,qs2QcycggWU,This video is freaking amazing!!!!
7327,qs2QcycggWU,Clickbait
7328,qs2QcycggWU,Is it tho?
7329,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing, your videos never fail to leave me amazed at human ingenuity."
7330,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, thank you!"
7331,qs2QcycggWU,this video is an absolute materpiece
7332,qs2QcycggWU,"Excellent video!  One minor correction(?) on the four panels on the satellite...they are all Ku-band user traffic.  Three are used for downlink, and one is used for uplink.  (This is also consistent with the asymmetric up/down traffic.)  The two mechanically-steered dishes are used for Ka-band traffic to the gateways.  At least as far as I understand, since there's no official documentation."
7333,qs2QcycggWU,"Huh.  I'll 100% research into this more, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were correct.  There have been so few technical specs on the satellite thus it makes me hesitant to do a satellite deep detailed explanation.  If you know of any solid sources for satellite specs, send them over.  Also- of course, there'll never be a satellite teardown as getting hold of one is impossible."
7334,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation yap uplink gateways use a steared direct dishes in protective domes to send all users data to a sat and there's 6-9 of them to be linked to different sats
7335,qs2QcycggWU,Very nice explanation & video however how much more effort would it take to also use miles equivalent to kilometers so you don't have to use a conversion table.  Seems to be
7336,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah.  I should have put the conversion in a corner note.
7337,qs2QcycggWU,My mind gets blown with every video you guys release.
7338,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!!
7339,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing 👏👏
7340,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you! 😊
7341,qs2QcycggWU,Very informative video. I love how I understood that I didn't understood a thing in the video 😂
7342,qs2QcycggWU,Happy to hear that!
7343,qs2QcycggWU,THE best visual and verbal tech videos on the interwebs.
7344,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!!
7345,qs2QcycggWU,mind=blown.
7346,qs2QcycggWU,"After watching this entire video, i felt a warm feeling of satisfaction and the way Neo felt, when he learnt Kungfu in Matrix"
7347,qs2QcycggWU,This is amazing scripting and production value. Thanks so much!
7348,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a couple of questions.   With all these millions or more beams that will be eventually be going through the atmosphere, will there be any negativity or harm to it and people, insects and animals?
Second question .  All these thousands of satellites, if a collision were to happen between them or from other satellites or even a meteor,couldn’t that cause a shot gun effect sending millions of high speed peaces hitting other satellites causing a domino effect which maybe make it extremely difficult and dangerous for launching anything including people into space because of a blanket of debris that could surround or envelope our planet ?"
7349,qs2QcycggWU,"For the first question - the answer would be no, because much much more ""beams"" come from our Sun. It is emitting significantly more energy on the visible wavelength which is in hundreds of THz not (GHz). The Starlinks uses aprox. 12 GHz which is much smaller frequency than visible light. So if visible light does not harm people, insects or animals, so does the starlink with much smaller energy and frequency."
7350,qs2QcycggWU,"Also to add to Kryzsztof.  Different wavelengths have different amounts of energy in them, and specifically the higher the frequency = more energy = more dangerous.  e.g. for UV you gotta wear sunscreen.  Whereas the entire opposite side, radio waves has MUCH less energy = no danger.  As for satellites- the Low Earth orbit results in these satellites burning up in the atmo much more easily in the case of collisions."
7351,qs2QcycggWU,"Why isn't anyone annoyed by the fact that inital iterations requiring so many ground stations renders the low atmosphere infraestructure useless. 
Musk should be penalized per every kg of combustion burned to deploy unnecessary infrastructure."
7352,qs2QcycggWU,Phenomenal mind-blowing tech explained in a simple way. Great work guys🙌🏻

7354,qs2QcycggWU,Great vid
7355,qs2QcycggWU,Great Tech... Feels like attending a class from the far future...
7356,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!
7357,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video -- one minor nitpick: It is not the case that 2 of the Phased Array's on the satellites are used for ground station communication. There are 2 parabolic antennas on each satellite for ground station communication. It is likely that 3 of the phased array antennas are TX, and 1 is RX given the spacing."
7358,qs2QcycggWU,"Gotta research this more, but I'll add this to the errata."
7359,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome, thank you so much"

7370,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!
7371,qs2QcycggWU,"24:47 ish fun fact: the unit of symbols per second is ""baud"".  Anybody here old enough to remember 1200 baud modems?  It seems we don't use the unit all that much anymore now that we have to measure it in scientific notation.  :D

Your videos are fantastic!"
7372,qs2QcycggWU,"I used 1200 baud modems.  Classic.  I was considering calling it baud, but sometimes I opt out of using the technical lingo because too much lingo can get confusing.    Much Appreciated!!!"

You've done an amazing job at explaining 64QAM, and other technical details to the public in this video, even though we engineering students have to spend an entire semester for learning it ground up. I am truly impressed that you could explain such complex topics in such simple terms. Keep up the good work."
7437,qs2QcycggWU,I love these videos.
7438,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!  We appreciate it!!  64 QAM was simplified as mentioned in the video, but hopefully, it'll inspire someone to pursue EE themselves."
7439,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best videos.
7440,qs2QcycggWU,"TV Satellites do not orbit the earth, if they did no one would receive a signal with their fixed dish. TV Satellites are geostationary so appear to be in a fixed positon in the sky hence people being able to aim their dishes at them and lock them in that position."
7441,qs2QcycggWU,Outstanding work. Talk about Revolutionary technology. I’m sure the military might have it years ago but it took Elon to bring it to the masses.
7442,qs2QcycggWU,Question! How on earth you could know all these things?
7443,qs2QcycggWU,"I see these starlinks on my Stellarium app. How many of these are up there? I'm worried about space junk. We've already trashed the earth, is space next??"
7444,qs2QcycggWU,This is really great information that is being explained here in such a simplified way. Branch Education is doing an awesome job 👏👍

7450,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  That's the business plan- only make A+ content that is incredibly detailed.
7451,qs2QcycggWU,Watching your video on my Starlink system - pretty cool.  I've had Starlink since Feb. of this year and really like it - a game changer for all us users living in rural areas.  The technology is mind blowing!  Thanks to Elon Musk for doing what no one else could.
7452,qs2QcycggWU,That's great to hear!!  It's so truly impressive as to how many industries he has catapulted forward.
7453,qs2QcycggWU,How does it perform during thurnderstorms/snow etc? What problems if any have you encountered?
7454,qs2QcycggWU,"QAM is really cool! It's a shame Bluetooth doesn't use it, transmitting lossless audio over Bluetooth is hard for that reason"
7455,qs2QcycggWU,Very good content
7456,qs2QcycggWU,"awesome explanation, thank you for the video"
7457,qs2QcycggWU,does beamforming work for receiving?

7459,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video 🙂
7460,qs2QcycggWU,Hell yes I'll leave a comment 👍
7461,qs2QcycggWU,You said ask anything so.. How is it possible to use the phase shifting technique for both controlling the beamforming and determining the data? If I need the beam at a certain phase but the data requires a different one what's going to happen?
7462,qs2QcycggWU,Such a simple explanation for way too complicated subject of wireless communication. Really appreciate your efforts to simplify things down to this level. Thank you so much. I learned something new today.
7463,qs2QcycggWU,That's great to hear!
7464,qs2QcycggWU,"Beam strengthening requires phase shifting but QAM also uses phase shifting to encode signa, so how it is resolved not to destroy data send when beam changes angel?"
7465,qs2QcycggWU,"Guys, this freaks me out. Best explanation ever!!!"
7466,qs2QcycggWU,"Awesome, very very high tech starlink space internet"

I ENJOYED FROM THE VIDEO :)
I DID WATCH THE VIDEO AT NORMAL SPEED AND IT ENDED FASTER THAN I UNDERSTUD I WATCHED 28:08 MINUTES , YES IT WAS VERY-INTERESTING AND I WOULD WATCH EVEN A HOUR OF VIDEO IF IT WAS THE CASE .
I DID A THUMB-UP ABOUT THE VIDEO AND I'M SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL :)

THANK YOU FROM ISRAEL :)"
7481,qs2QcycggWU,"I am amazed how Elon Musk is doing so much different mind blowing technical leaps in 1 time. He has not a single company but a dozen, each blowing every competitor away, and combine it also it with it's own rockets and his own satellites to reduce the costs. He is in so many types mind blowing technology that he single handling the tech race to a new point. 

I can hardly understand this already simplified video but he and his workforce is inventing the new world everything from top to bottom and back..."
7482,qs2QcycggWU,Those brilliant engineers who work for Elon's company did all of this tech. He is an entrepreneur he can't do this complicated physic and math.
7483,qs2QcycggWU,"@@hamka1288Yes without them they wouldn't be successful. However i praise Elons entrepreneurship doing all those thing and bring everything together to make this possible. There are companies that fail because as simple as 2 people can't work together. 

Elon put the best people, resources everything together to make things possible like NASA couldn't bring a man to the ISS. How would that go now with Russia's war on Ukraine as an sample. NASA funded with billions couldn't build a rocket for bringing people in space."
7484,qs2QcycggWU,This is an awesome video!
7485,qs2QcycggWU,great...
7486,qs2QcycggWU,"These animations are simply superb!  Very complex topics made visually simple enough to comprehend. Very well done.

If there is a second  video in this series, please cover (if possible) the process in which the user terminal is seamlessly transferred from satellite to satellite.  My suspicion is that doppler shift at 12GHz is a substantial challenge. (?)"
7487,qs2QcycggWU,"There's definitely a doppler shift, but a good question as to how much.   Hopefully, eventually, we'll get into the satellite more."
7488,qs2QcycggWU,"Very interesting video to introduce a complex technology to common people, it brings many science domains in a single piece, the animations are very well designed to visualize what underneath real life. Thanks for sharing."
7489,qs2QcycggWU,I have subscribed to your channel but liking this video and commenting are ways of applicating and giving thank you for the effort.
7490,qs2QcycggWU,For god sake!
7491,qs2QcycggWU,Brilliant thanks much!
7492,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
7493,qs2QcycggWU,How many antennas in the new smaller rectangle dish?
7494,qs2QcycggWU,"I like your ""break-down"".  And it even seems a ""no-brainer"" when it comes to talk between the sender me(customer) to the satellite.  But on the other end.  When the satellite is the sender.  How many customers can one satellite handle at a time?  Your video mentioned that a satellite has (4) antennas.  But I'm pretty sure the limit doesn't stop at (4).  SO, where does it stop?  And WHY?  And how does that part work?"
7495,qs2QcycggWU,That topic is very complicated. First you have TDMA or time division multiple access. Every user have a time schedule where they are allowed to transmit or received. Then you have FDMA frequency division multiple access. Each user is assign a slightly different frequency to transmit and received. Then we have CDMA code division multiple access. It Is a mathematical trick where each user is assigned a numerical key and these key is use to transmit and received signal without interference. OFDMA orthogonal frequency division multiple access it is sort of all the above techniques combine. The entire channel is divided into chunks or sub channel using all the tricks to pack as many subchannel as possible. MIMO multi input multi output this uses multiple antenna to serve different users. With phase array you can have MaMIMO Massive MIMO uses more than a hundred antenna per user to gain more efficiency. NOMA non orthogonal multiple access. This has yet to be implemented in real world application but it uses different power levels for each user and signal has to be process to remove the signal with different power. I don't know which technique Starlink uses but to get maximum number of user it has to be a combination of OFDMA and MIMO.
7496,qs2QcycggWU,"@@kazedcat I'm with you.  And it makes a lot of sense.  Except, the question that remains is.  (How many)?  How many subscribers can ONE satellite entertain, while keeping the user base up to 1Gbps down at least."
7497,qs2QcycggWU,@@vangildermichael1767 Currently per satelite is limited to 40Gbps that gets divided to how many active user is connected to the satellite. It was originally limited to 20Gbps but newer satellites has twice the bandwidth. Future bandwidth improvement will be done by increasing the number of satellites. Starship will carry larger satellite so there is a potential of increase per satellite bandwidth capacity once the Starship rocket starts carrying satellites to orbit. Assuming the satellite lifted by Starship gets another doubling that will be 80Gbps per satellite.
7498,qs2QcycggWU,"@@kazedcat And (on the surface), that doesn't seem like much (40 Gbps).  Until, I realize, that each user is only on there for a nanosecond.  So, when the method goes around, 40 Gbps is enough for well over an hundred people."
7499,qs2QcycggWU,@@vangildermichael1767 This is why Starlink plans to have 40 thousand satellite. Even with that many satellite. Starlink could not cover the entire population of highly dense cities. I think they also have license application for use of higher frequency but frequency above 30Ghz needs a lot of power to overcome atmospheric attenuation.
7500,qs2QcycggWU,*Sir make a video on how does reusable rocket work 🙂*
7501,qs2QcycggWU,Sir please make more videos on engineering 😍
7502,qs2QcycggWU,"As you add more and more of these one next to another at each home, how does the destructive interference not interfere with the other antennas?"
7503,qs2QcycggWU,"Very good video. But I would call this video more of ""How a Starlink Terminal works"". I think you can do another video of how it works overall. You did not explain why there are Ground Stations, what they do, and why they are needed. Then you can add why the version 1.5 satellites are important with the laser communications between the satellites are important. Why it does not work over large spans of water / ocean (at least not right now)."

7506,qs2QcycggWU,"That is absolutely awesome! This could be a part 1 Starlink Series... The other part, 2, could be how that 10000+ Starlink Satellites communicate with each other, when it reach to this number. I heard that, in the future, they will be able to receive data from the initial Dishy, talk to each other over the space till the destination and head back in the same way to the initial Dishy, making the fastest communication ever. For instance, from America to Asia, the initial Dishy in Earth sends data to Satellite in Space that sends data to another Dishy in the Earth that sends it again to another Satellite in space till it reaches Asia and heads back to the initial Dishy in America using the same process. It could face Death interferences. But with Starlink Satellites talking to each other, the data leaves the initial Dishy in America,reaches the first Satellite that sends it to another Satellite, traveling on just only in space, till it gets to Asia. I think no Earthling interference during the process will be fantastic! I am sorry, I am not good at explaining things but... Well thank you very much for this wonderful video and channel Branch Education!"
7507,qs2QcycggWU,Indeed! In the future we're planning on making a really comprehensive video on what's inside the satellite.
7508,qs2QcycggWU,As if there is only 1 dishy per satellite. In reality the satellites transmit to  hundreds if not thousands of dishies.
7509,qs2QcycggWU,Really great video!!
7510,qs2QcycggWU,This is one of the best videos that this channel has ever made
7511,qs2QcycggWU,22:50 how changing in phase for coding  doesnt cause to changing the oriantation of tha waves ? As you told for tracking the sattelites
7512,qs2QcycggWU,The intricacies of how that works is 🤯. I hope we could have that in my country.
7513,qs2QcycggWU,"Beam Steering. What you showed was a 2D Beam Steering, yeah? Does Dishy do 3D Beam Steering? I can't figure out how it would be 3D by just manipulating a phase shift."
7514,qs2QcycggWU,How's each satellite know the same information as the other satellite
7515,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video, mixing simplification with details!"
7516,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7517,qs2QcycggWU,"What a pleasure to watch <3 well made and very interesting!
But what is not clear for me is how the satellite can send so many different signals to many different dishes? It has just 2 sending dishes right?"
7518,qs2QcycggWU,It's switching thousands times in a second to different clients... And all the time calculate there is all those clients are located on seen part of planet... Ugggghhh )
7519,qs2QcycggWU,@@tvguide4khv ahhhh nice thanks for the answer!

7524,qs2QcycggWU,Another brilliant delivery of information by Branch Education. We Youtubers thank you!
7525,qs2QcycggWU,"Things we take for granted, are so complex and require lots of work and research. Im truly stunned by the working of this system as well as the animation and overall video. Detailed yet easy to understand and focusing on the required points. I thank each and everyone involved in making of this video, thanks for the information."
7526,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!!  We appreciate it!
7527,qs2QcycggWU,"So true! and then we'll have people bitching about delays while posting a pic (give it some time. it goest to the space!). Or this service costing $$. This is astounding piece of work! It is hard to me to understand, but people theorized, calculated, prototyped, implemented the software for it, built the hardware, sent it all to space! This is magic."
7528,qs2QcycggWU,Everything possible in the cartoons world.
7529,qs2QcycggWU,@@Nithr1s it's magic and witchcrafting . Nothing is going to the space and bouncing back. All are ground based antennas and sea cables.
7530,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once again😁 solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
7531,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation If earth and atmosphere spin 1600 KMph in the eastward direction, then flights traveling west at max speed 1000 KMph, must be having hard time to cruise and would never reach its westward destination. But in real life scenario, flights reach the destinations between A and B at the same duration regardless of the direction. This one fact alone is enough to prove that the earth is NOT a spinning ball, but rather a flat disk.. Globe model is illuminati deception, and it's been busted.. checkmate.."
7532,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation  Satellites don't exist. GPS not working in ocean. GPS is just the triangulation of cell towers. Internet cables are buried under the ocean. Time to wake up. Trust your senses..
_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth. There is a treaty signed by 50 countries that no man can get to Antarctica, because it's the surrounding wall of our flat earth, and it extends very far."
7533,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BranchEducation No curvature evidence, no spinning evidence, no Antarctica circumnavigation, releasing fake cgi images, yet they are yelling that we are traveling on a stupid ball with high pressure air rubbing against vacuum. What a pathetic bunch of losers. Their cognitive dissonance won't let them realize that earth is flat and non-moving.
_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic. Shame on those who believe globe earth nonsense, globers keep whining but still they don't have a single proof that earth is flying, spinning, or having curvature. 2022 is the year of waking up."

7539,qs2QcycggWU,"@@ryzenryne8747 if you had brains you could give me an answer. Seems like Google and school didn't really help you, did it?"
7540,qs2QcycggWU,"How were you able to go into such detail? I would assume alot of this would be propriety information. Patents? If amplitude affects the signal transmitted/received, how do they account for signals that are attenuated by objects between Dishy McFlatface and the satellite?"
7541,qs2QcycggWU,I took a lovely half-asleep nap while listening to this 😌. If I do that enough times I’m convinced I’ll absorb the information.
7542,qs2QcycggWU,Great video and amazing animation! I have a question though: how is it possible that 1 starling antenna does not interfere with another one?
7543,qs2QcycggWU,The signals sent from the satellite are sent at different times within a single second.
7544,qs2QcycggWU,So cool!
7545,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow!  This is an incredibly clear video, making such a complex topic easy to understand!  Well done!!!"

7556,qs2QcycggWU,"yes my mind is blown, gread video"
7557,qs2QcycggWU,One question I have:  How can a satellite with only four fazed array antennas service thousands of dishy users at the same time?
7558,qs2QcycggWU,This was literally a good use of the word exactly.
7559,qs2QcycggWU,thank you
7560,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video! Thank you very much!
7561,qs2QcycggWU,good video
7562,qs2QcycggWU,How did they make this work?🤯🤯
7563,qs2QcycggWU,Why are we still playing around shiftng charge for transmission when we should be using entanglement results?
7564,qs2QcycggWU,"Cool. Hard topic shown with ease. Simplifications at proper level to understand the concept. The hardest and more detailed part was implemented by full time employees at Starlink. I guess the steering committee don't have much broader general idea than this explained here (of course they know much more, but in other areas). Thank you!"
7565,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!!  Yeah- I wish we could have discussed with an engineer who actually works on Starlink, but- not yet..."
7566,qs2QcycggWU,"hah cool thing you recommending us to increse the video speed, I always do that anyways. But that is no good for people with anxiety problems so be wary of that."
7567,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you, this is a fantastic video. I have a question. How is the 64QAM implemented if the phase is already shifting to form the beam?"
7568,qs2QcycggWU,"The phase shift for beam forming is relative to each antenna. The 64QAM phase shift is global to all antennas. So if you have a signal going in with phase 0, that could be sin(t + 0). Then pointing forward, two antennas would have: sin(t + 0), and sin(t + 0) as well. Now if you point to the right, then the antennas may be sin(t+0) and sin(t+45), respectively. Then when you phase shift the main signal for 64QAM, it may shift to sin(t+30), where pointing forward the two antennas would be sin(t+30) and sin(t+30). Pointing to the right again, they would be sin(t+30) and sin(t+30+45). 
That may sound like a lot of work, but it's done in steps. First the main signal is shifted and modulated as per 64QAM and then distributed to each of the front-ends. The front ends then individually apply an additional shift for bream-forming. Essentially, the signal being transmitted (or received) and its phase shift are independent from the phase shift used by beamforming."
7569,qs2QcycggWU,"Very informative video, Thanks"

7581,qs2QcycggWU,For the algorithm
7582,qs2QcycggWU,This is crazy well made. Good job
7583,qs2QcycggWU,"It's meaningful for everyone who lives in this generation, thanks alot!"
7584,qs2QcycggWU,"I first encountered phase steering 40 years ago. It's amazing to see how far it's come.

Likewise the first 64QAM kit I used back then was a 7 foot tall 19 inch rack for 140Mb/s @ 12GHz terrestrial linking and only went 20km. 3 years later there were 7 of them in the same 7 foot tall rack

Each rack drew close to 3kW for 200mW transmit power


As an aside, audio modems used 64QAM for 33k6 and DSL uses hundreds of discrete 64 QAM carriers. The difference is the carrier frequency and symbol rate"
7585,qs2QcycggWU,"That's pretty cool to hear about!  During the research, I saw images of the early phased arrays and Lincoln Labs using dipole antennas.  Pretty cool stuff indeed."
7586,qs2QcycggWU,"Could you transmit data modulating frequency, phase and amplitude? Then you'd be able to have a sort of 3D array of symbols!"
7587,qs2QcycggWU,"@@SomeRandomPiggo phase modulation and frequency modulation are closely related. Frequency shift keying was the original method of modulating signals in most cases

The problem is that frequency modulation generates masses of sidebands and ends up being spectrally fairly inefficient (AM is inefficient from a power point of view)"
7588,qs2QcycggWU,"@@miscbits6399 I see, quite often if an obvious idea seems good, its almost definitely been tried before"
7589,qs2QcycggWU,ADMITTING THAT IS ENOUGH TO BRAND YOU AS SIMPLE - STUP.
7590,qs2QcycggWU,"@@revan552 And then you decided to add nothing to the conversation with your comment, selfishly interjecting yourself into it."
7591,qs2QcycggWU,"Yes- QAM has been around for a long time. In the 1980s I worked with it dealing with dial-up modems in order to increase the amount of data sent across the network. Whether terrestrial or wireless, the QAM technique works in the same manner."
7592,qs2QcycggWU,All good things and all for free like oxygen.

7595,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. Wish I could subscribe a 2nd time
7596,qs2QcycggWU,"So, out of all of the individual antennas that are transmitting  or receiving destructive interference,  and are then not part of the signal being sent to, or received, from a satellite, how many are actually being used,  out of that 1,000 + antennas. In other words, just how many elements ARE being used, at any one moment in time, for actual transmission and reception?  My guess is less than half, but that is only a guess  :)"

7649,qs2QcycggWU,"I've been reading about 5G lately and found out that it has directional antenna called phased array antenna to work without any moving part. 
I found a lot of mathematic and it really-really hard to understand, this video however especially the beam-forming clear up so much my confusion."
7650,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah- I found out also that it's in 5G, but decided to focus on the other fields- like mid-flight internet because 5G is a little heated of a topic on YouTube."
7651,qs2QcycggWU,5G is actually a lot more complicated because of multipathing. So the transmitter does not have the advantage of knowing the exact angle and direction to send the signal. This is a limitation of Starlink communication there must be a clear path with no obstruction between the dish and the satellite. 5g can work around obstructions.
7652,qs2QcycggWU,🌠This is a tremendous amount of engineering put into one small device. Incredible technology. Hats off to the Branch Education channel creators for explaining this with awesome visuals.🌟🌟🌟

truly amazing content 😘"
7663,qs2QcycggWU,one of the most underrated channels in yt community...i pray that you guys deserve a hell lot of reach and you guys rightfully deserve so i loved the explanation and animation
7664,qs2QcycggWU,"This is a stunningly good explanation, huge thanks from this retired nerd! . Its amazing how simple and reliable SpaceX have made this highly complex technology to use. I know a few people here in NZ with Starlink, and it absolutely rocks for our relatively tiny rural population. One friend had his zero-techie wife unbox and set it up, and within 5 mins they had 250 Mbps. And even the US military were gobsmacked by how SpaceX managed to drop in 000's of terminals into the Ukraine military 2-3 days after the war broke out, and completely neutralise Russian's prior mega attack on the Ukrainians' Viasat satellite military comms system. The Ukraine military now have the world's best integrated comms system for weapons targeting and control, and Starlink is one of the key reasons (along with Ukrainian tech brilliance). The Russians also tried to radio-jam the Starlink terminals, but Starlink downloaded a patch to all terminals immediately to stop this jamming in its tracks. Starlink is now Ukraine's military backbone as well as providing wifi internet to 100,000+ Ukrainians in areas where the Russians have destroyed the mobile infrastructure. And, amazingly, these hugely complex terminals can all run off a 12V vehicle cigarette lighter."
7665,qs2QcycggWU,The situation in the Ukraine is not of Russia's making. It is all down to NATO aggression which is led by the US and the UK. Agreements and commitments were not honoured by NATO. It takes brilliant minds to build this technology but it takes commonsense to stop us all getting killed and you people seem to be lacking in that.🌱
7666,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah.. but not. This will not help the Ukrainian, Nazi authorities. You have no idea what signal jamming is. A patch alone can't fix it. For Russia, it does not cause any inconvenience, the presence of Starlink access points for Ukrainians. Ukrainians need this in many ways only to send fakes to the West. Each access point is a transceiver. If this transmitter is located in a special operation zone, it will be localized and destroyed. Over time, depending on legislative decisions, these access points will be taken away from the population, or deactivated."
7667,qs2QcycggWU,"Even tho it took forever, it was a super fun video to research because of just how impressively complex it is. I agree, it's soo awesome how this tech is helping out the Ukrainians defend their country.  It's also crazy to think that this tech was designed by a fewer than 1000 engineers."
7668,qs2QcycggWU,You need to reread history of Ukraine and check your propaganda sources. You will find that all of Zelenskyy's and Azov data is monitored.
7669,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation you did a great job! Have you noticed the two panicked Russian trolls in my replies?😂
7670,qs2QcycggWU,"And when the Ukrainians needed their Dishies to respond fast enough for a moving vehicle, Starlink flipped a switch and it worked for everyone around the world, even after they told the rest of us it was a feature that ""maybe"" would happen in the future."
7671,qs2QcycggWU,IF IT IS THAT GOOD - HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
7672,qs2QcycggWU,"@@thatguy-art6229 
Because Ukraine President Zelenski said so.   In no uncertain words. According to Zelensky's office when Musk was asked to help, he had the first terminals in Ukraine THE NEXT DAY!  Over ten thousand StarLink terminals have now been delivered with still more on the way.  Ukrainians on the ground are reporting that the ease with which these are employed is amazing."
7673,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation Upon the shoulders of giants. Military and commercial did the heavy financial lifting in making phased array useful. Starlink made it economical.
7674,qs2QcycggWU,"I think this is a really poor, often wrong (on the antenna gain for example) , explanation of how a phased array antenna (an old concept) work, wikipedia does a much better work at it.

7721,qs2QcycggWU,thank you for producing this.
7722,qs2QcycggWU,"Honestly, I'm more interested in how the Starlink satellites communicate with a central network. I would assume that all of them are in visual range of at least one other at all times. I assume that they transmit the signals through each other until it reaches one that is over a ground station. But I'd love to learn exactly how that process works. How much additional latency does that add to the signal? How many ground stations are there?

I'd also be interested in how the Starlink satellite itself is able to communicate with multiple dishes. If one is over say New York, or some densely populated area, how does that affect its bandwidth for each individual receiver? In this video, you said that it has two uplink and two downlink dishes, so how would it manage to communicate with multiple users with only two downlinks? Initilly I thought it would utilize a time share like process. But that would essentially mean each users bandwidth is halved for each additional user connected to that same satellite, which seems infeasible. Most wireless networks would dedicate a certain number of channels at slightly different frequencies, but is this even possible for Starlink? Does it need to direct its beam like the ground base dishes have to? That would seem to make channels effectively useless. Or, does it have a stronger more complex method of transmitting signals that does not require the beam to be directed?"
7723,qs2QcycggWU,"The eventual plan is for laser links to route traffic between the satellites, but don't think this is working yet. Currently I believe the data is sent to a groundstation within the same footprint. It then gets routed to the local internet. Starlink is a contended service so data rate is time sliced. If the satellites phased array is made using similar design, it doesn't look possible to send multiple beams to different users at the same time(5G does this). Hence it's likely time sliced. There are reports now of users data rates suffering significantly in heavily subscribed areas that back this up. A key question for starlinks viability it how it can gain enough subscribers to foot the bill for all those launches without diluting the data rate to the point where it becomes unusable."
7724,qs2QcycggWU,"I have a solid understanding of electronic circuits in general, but the complexity of the Starlink satellite system totally blows my mind. The electronic circuits that are used to transmit and receive extremely high-frequency signals are quite different from common circuits found in your average consumer electronic gadgets. Thankfully, Branch Education makes understanding complex subjects like this one much easier and more thoroughly than if I tried to learn them on my own. Thank you VERY MUCH Branch Education!"

In December, sun makes bigger circle close to australia, so summer there and winter for north countries. It makes perfect sense. EARTH IS FLAT. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE NEVER EXISTED.
 _ some other globers say earth is revolving in a circular path with off centered sun, then you got huge problem, for some months sun should be huge in size and very small for other months. But in reality sun appears the same size for all 12 months in a year. Busted again.

Also, this is a youtube comment and I was not trying to portray something I'm not, but I just wanted to add my opinion that this video's information is correct. 
I've clearly stated my background to the previous comment without trying to hide anything and I also gave my recommendation of the ""normal"" path of a career in RF engineering. The path I followed was way more difficult and I'm still reading everyday to ""catch up"" to people who had a proper RF background. 

I might not build (or understand) silicon based metasurface antennas or complex RF amplifiers, nor did I claim to be an expert antenna designer. However I am a better antenna designer than a communications engineer (don't tell my boss), so I didn't think I was misdirecting the Youtube community. 
I hope that clears things up."

What happens on you tube STAYS ON TUBE !!! :p

2. RE "" so I didn't think I was misdirecting the Youtube community.

There is nothing to clear up and don't be so sensitive , i'm not attacking you nor discrediting you , if anything i respect you as a fellow engineer

3. I understand what you're saying but stating it that way (you have to admit) is very weird.

4. RE 
"" Theoretically I am a communications engineer but what I know best is to design and build antennas. It wasn't my degree that gave me that job but rather my knowledge and practical experience around telecommunications and especially antennas.  ""

Sure... but   you are a communications engineer
You see mate (and i hope you know this) you don't need a degree to be an engineer, You don't need a corporation TO AGREE that you are an engineer just because you gave them $50,000 and they gave you a course,  ""A Course"" which is modified all the time for various reasons, some legitimate , some are just bullshit to suit government requirements 

Point being.. it's great if you go to uni to get your engineering knowledge, but Uni is not the only place you can get that knowledge
if one is dedicated if one wants to learn they will and if they do but have not done it through a uni they will not have the paper to show, but it doesn't mean they are not an engineer 

if they then go and build shit and use their knowledge to accomplish useful things , if they then go and help the world with the knowledge that they know if they make a difference in some way in the world that positively impacts the world  THEY ARE BY DEFINITION ""AN ENGINEER""

You build antenna's from the ground up, THAT'S AN ENGINEER.
the discipline is Communications, therefore you are a Communications engineer . if you posses the engineering knowledge to build the antenna, if it works, if you give it to the world for practical use you are a communications engineer, simple as that

I find people tend to get oversensitive about not stating things that they don't have a degree for 
in saying that, i have seen many come out of a degree and know very little, to the point where i would not agree they are engineers
the degree is not the decider of whether one is or isn't an engineer
THE KNOWLEDGE WE POSSES , 
WHAT WE DO WITH IT 
Decides if we are engineers or not, and what i have learned over a few decades is ... the one conclusive way to decide if you are an engineer is OTHER ENGINEERS HAVE TO AGREE THAT YOU ARE AN ENGINEER
There is no degree, there is no bullshit, there is nothing you can pay for , it's just a simple fact of..... Show us what you can do and we'll decide if you are.

and that way the term will always have respect and mean something

Mostly it's a matter of semantics.  I know near to nothing about antenna engineering,  so it's a moot point for me. For many years I subscribed to a magazine called Wireless Design and Development (WD&D), which is kind of the trade magazine for wireless technology. Exciting stuff, but it's so specialized, and just doesn't excite me as much as basic computer science and IT work. However, wireless technology is becoming more and more pervasive every day. So, I salute anyone working in that field. Finally, as in the video,  nice to see wireless technology being used in the civilian sector, not just in military applications. 😀"
7753,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 Fair enough.
well mate, i've never attended Uni in the states,  I'm in Australia , Sydney
I've spoken to people in europe, U.S.A. India, Africa and U.K.   Never heard anyone mention the degree Antenna Engineer
it's also Telecommunication Engineer or E.E. or RF Applications or Wireless Application or something like that,  The Antenna part of it is a given,  if someone were an Antenna Engineer here in australia, they would have only 1 job..  To build Antenna's
so maybe this is a U.S. thing
but yeah , to me it's really fucking weird that i've never heard that before

we all accept that Engineering courses are like    Electrical and Electronics or  computer Science or things like that,  and.. they are universal Titles for the most part,  aren't they ?"
7754,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 
Hold on.. So.. You're NOT an engineer ? (i assumed you were)
yeah.. Uni courses are generally universally named because they are recognized worldwide. you have coutries where certain additional courses are needed but the CORE subjects are recognized and an engineer is respected worldwide as ""An Engineer""  regardless o the discipline they undertook
in Australia an Antenna related course would be Telecommunications Engineering, you would start with Electrical and Electronics CORE Subjects then Minor in Telecommunications and a sub branch may be R.F. Applications, if that tickled your fancy

i don't think it's semantics ,  i think it's how they universally name it 
i mean take this...   i did BENGH (it means Bachelor degree in ENGineering - Honours)
so you had the lower counterpart BENG (Same course, but the H is higher recognized and harder passing criteria,  Truth be told,  i only picked the Honours course because BENG was full  :P) And now that i have it i sound like something from men in black.............""With Honours""............""sir""    LOL

but the point is,  you then go to europe, they have the same thing, you go to USA they have the exact same course name, i believe M.I.T. carries the same course name
so i don't think it's semantics
To be just an Antenna engineer is a sub topic to the whole thing and to do it you need a degree in Electronics and Electrical and then Minor in Telecommunications
THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME AN ANTENNA ENGINEER which is why my original comment said what it said....  it's weird the way it's stated 
it's like if someone was an electrician,    it's called  CERTIFICATE 3 IN ELECTRO TECHNOLOGY 
you do a certain amount of time in the industry and a person refers you and you then apply to the licensing board for a licence for  CERTIFIED ELECTRICIAN

but even though electricians deal with , let's say  RELAYS,  you don't have a RELAY TECHNICIAN or RELAY ELECTRICIAN,  that's covered in Cert 3 in Electro Technology

"" For many years I subscribed to a magazine called Wireless Design and Development (WD&D)""
LOL.. yeah i know it

"" and just doesn't excite me as much as basic computer science and IT work. ""
Sure, i get that,  i'm also an I.T. Engineer
and since you're an I.T. Guy,  i can then tell you this , As i'm the following

- I.T. Guy
- Telecommunications Guy
- Being Repairing electronics since i was 6  guy (i'm 49)
- TV Antenna and Satellite guy
- CCTV and Security Guy
- NBN and Internet Infrastructure Guy
- Wireless computer Guy
- Wireless RF Guy

that being said
it is one thing to be talking about Wireless Transmission in I.T. Networks and the mentality that systems admin's have
it's a completely different kettle of fish when you're talking Wireless Transmission to a HAM Operator or even to an R.F. Guy

Just like it's a completely different kettle of fish to talk to an I.T. Guy about Ethernet cable and then phone lines,  but then... Talk to a Telecom's Linesman about Phone lines and the I.T. system Admin is lost in the topic, but then you talk to a Linesman about let's say OSI Model and Encapsulation and he is also lost

being on the I.T. Side of the fence of Wireless is a completely different ball game to being on the R.F. side of Wireless..  The R.F. side is definitely the better side to be on in this respect, But ask an I.T. Guy 
- What is the formula for wavelength
- What is a half wave Dipole
- How do you construct an antenna for a certain set of frequencies

i promise you they won't know, but for an R.F Engineer, this is 1+1


""So, I salute anyone working in that field.""

7755,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Yes, mate. Great observations."
7756,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Thank you for your long-winded explanation, Martin. It all makes perfect sense.

You've probably hear the riddle ""how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?"" Hehehe 🤪. 

Originally I studied to be an EE, but the physics courses looked quite grueling (thermodynamics, gravity, etc.). My interests were more into software and computer systems, so I earned a BSCS from Cal State Northridge. It isn't known for much internationally,  except that there was a big earthquake there exactly 29 years ago today (01/17/1994), one year after graduating. Most jobs I've held didn't fully take advantage of the school curriculum,  but it at least provided the credentials needed in order to at least meet an employer's requirements. These days companies are looking more for practical knowledge (like Elon Musk demands), so we can thank YouTube for getting up to speed with technical learning!

The school did have an antenna 📡 laboratory, but as you mentioned I believe it fell under various ""EE"" majors, and no degrees for 'antenna engineering.'

In the 80s I worked for several computer companies that made disk drives, communication equipment, etc. However, by 1985 most of the hardware jobs were moving to Asia and Mexico. Plus, many foreign students were becoming EE's because they were good in math and physics.  They weren't good in English, so software was still an open field (this was before the Internet and offshoring became of age). 

Anyway, it looks like you also had a long and exciting career in the computer field, Martin.

A college buddy of mine moved to Sydney in the 1990s. He did very well as an IT worker, and enjoyed living on the 'Gold Coast.' He was a woman chaser,  but if I had a chance to visit your city, just going to the Sydney Opera House and climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge would be a thrill!

Well, enjoy your evening, Martin, and Happy New Year!"

ahhh.. so you don't know how to change a light bulb......... GOT IT !!   LOL

4 ""so I earned a BSCS from Cal State Northridge. It isn't known for much internationally,""
As did i , I attended RMIT which is (as far as prestige is concerned) #1 in Australia, Approx 16th in the world
Now... In my humble opinion, that doesn't mean JACK SHIT !!!

5. "" Most jobs I've held didn't fully take advantage of the school curriculum,  but it at least provided the credentials needed in order to at least meet an employer's requirements.""
LMFAO... YEAH... 
by the time i attended i had already been running a business for several years, in all honesty .. so let me preface something first to avoid confusion
Here in Australia  we have TAFE (Government Funded College), Private College's and University

Our University is your college
i don't know what you call TAFE in the states, but for us , College is what you do after high school but before Uni and Uni is not a necessity, neither is college for that matter but it's highly advised

so...  i attended every course under the sun in TAFE it got fucking boring so i went to Uni out of a desire to learn more, it had nothing to do with getting a job , for me
but yeah, that's what i heard mate, from the young one's
""Why are you here""..............  ""To get a good job"" 
LMFAO
this was the usual response.

""These days companies are looking more for practical knowledge (like Elon Musk demands), so we can thank YouTube for getting up to speed with technical learning!""
I Agree,  and i think there is nothing better than practical knowledge, Although.. this is from a hardware standpoint, but i think it still stands true for coding, I've done my fair share

""The school did have an antenna 📡 laboratory, but as you mentioned I believe it fell under various ""EE"" majors, and no degrees for 'antenna engineering.'""
that sounds correct

""In the 80s I worked for several computer companies that made disk drives""
LOL  awww fuck...  do tell
IBM, DEC, Winchester Storage ???
i remember my Verbatim , Double side, Double Density Disks,  but.. i was a young lad at the time

"" just going to the Sydney Opera House and climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge would be a thrill!""
LOL.... mate, you're such a fucking tourist  LOL
No.. but if you're ever in the area, Message me, i'll show you around 
Going to Opera house is a given, you probably won't see opera, you'll probably have a drink at the bar,   botanical gardens are another tourist thingy and then you have to do the following to get your initiation down pat

Bridge climb
bondi Beach
Kings Cross Night life
Revolving Restaurant at Centrepoint (sydney Tower)
Circular quay boat ride to somewhere
Taronga Zoo
Queen Victoria building walk
Centennial Park

After you do that and separate yourself form the asians with camera's and the english backpackers WE CAN THEN DO SOME REAL SHIT

as for your mate in the 90s,  yeah around that time there was an I.T. Company boom, a mate of mine was also part of it, it got to a point where no one knew which company was which and when you asked someone ""which company do you work for"" the response would be ""Oh.. one of these big I.T. companies""   (no one cared to name them anymore)

Enjoy your evening mate as well

however courses are regulated and there is a standard to the naming of engineering courses, that's what i'm referring to"
7760,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Hello Martin!

Thank you for all your replies and comments, Martin! Greatly appreciated.  I've been getting busier these days, so can't spend too much time trolling around on YouTube.  However, thank you again for your comments. Just a few observations:

* How many computer programmers does it take to change a light bulb?💡 

A: none - it's a hardware problem. (probably the first computer riddle, if not the lamest one).

* Disk drive companies:

In the late 1970s an IBM engineer named Sirjang L. Tandon devised a way to place a read/write head on the opposite side of a floppy 💾 disk, creating the double-sided disk drive. His superiors told him to put the drive on a shelf where it collected dust. As a result, he left IBM and started his own company, Tandon Magnetics, which I worked for after high school. This spawned a dozen disk drive companies in the northwest corner of Los Angeles, where I eventually worked for half of them. Of course, when Seagate Technology began producing 5¼-inch hard disc drives, these floppy firms also jumped in. Most of these companies are now defunct, although Tandon's claim to fame was providing the initial floppy disk drives for the IBM PC, which debuted in 1981. From 1984 I then worked at a company called Micom systems, which produced high-speed modems, multiplexers and APBX equipment. So, Southern California did have and still has a vibrant electronics industry, although much of it has been offshored to countries with cheaper labor and less environmental regulations. I'm sure the same trend happened in Australia 🇦🇺 as well. 

* Yep  my college buddy was part of that 90s IT boom on the Gold Coast... he raved about Bondi Beach ⛱  and all that stuff. Haven't heard from him since, though... maybe a shark got him. 

Well, that's about it, mate!

Enjoy the rest of your week, Martin, and cheers!"
7761,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 
No worries dude

Re your friend
i forsee 3 scenarios

it certainly wasn't a shark, i would have seen it on the news and told you .

1. Probably mauled to death by a magpie or a dropbear.

2. he probably hooked up with an English Backpacker and hasn't left her apartment yet   LOL...
We just need to be patient my friend

3. it's been hot lately ,  he may have literally melted while sun bathing at bondi beach
he was likely soaked up by the sand , Poor Bastard, so they won't find him"
7762,qs2QcycggWU,"@@martinkuliza Yep - knowing my friend, it's definitely the English backpacker. I'm afraid his goose is cooked! 🍳"
7763,qs2QcycggWU,"@@michaelmeichtry316 
I think so mate
English backpackers have a thing for Aussies"
7764,qs2QcycggWU,this is a comment
7765,qs2QcycggWU,Great info thanks.
7766,qs2QcycggWU,"This channel is incredible, so many insanely detailed videos.
Do you research a new topic for each video, or are you relying on existing knowledge from your team?

It is difficult to see how much impact you have on people just from the view numbers, but I feel your content has helped me a lot.
Thanks so much for the incredible work. :)"
7767,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!!  We appreciate it!
7768,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing explanation and awesome graphics.
7769,qs2QcycggWU,Very interesting...keep up the good work 👍🏽
7770,qs2QcycggWU,"How awesome is this video!  Thank you,  mister!  This video really motivates me in choosing m6 career path! It's awesome!"
7771,qs2QcycggWU,"I didn't want to speed up a masterpiece like this, so I watched it three times at the regular speed.🤓"
7772,qs2QcycggWU,"Incidentally, I now better understand phased array radars for fighter jets. So thank you doubly!"
7773,qs2QcycggWU,How many mini-antennas are in each of the 4 Phased Array Antennas on the satellite? And how can they communicate with multiple Dishies at the same time?
7774,qs2QcycggWU,I love you
7775,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent content. Well explained. Accurate. Precisely what is needed to inspire nerdy engineers. I am sorry I am so old. Such things would have me get crazy in my prime!
7776,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing, so nicely explained . . .  Need more creators like you."
7777,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing. I have been waiting for years for such a detailed and fascinating explanation. Thank you so much!
7778,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing explanation ❤️
7779,qs2QcycggWU,"As I said in LESICS, it would be a good idea to make a video with this kind of animations abut the James Webb Telescope. 
May be colaboration with LESICS. 
Kind regards from Mexico."
7780,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow i already knew a good part of how it worked, but still learned quite a bit, impressive work
More impressive is how well you condensed it into a video"
7781,qs2QcycggWU,"tbh, that was a pretty clear and accurate presentation of QAM"
7782,qs2QcycggWU,who cares?
7783,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is awesome!! I used to design very similar antennas. Spot on, great summary! You just saved me a lot of hours explaining."
7784,qs2QcycggWU,Thank You for constantly feeding our curiosities with the Best-in-Class Answers! Never imagined the complexity be explained this easily.
7785,qs2QcycggWU,"I wonder what kind of voltage is used in antenas, to create the singal. Few volts, few hundret?"
7786,qs2QcycggWU,We need a video on SpaceX's dragon
7787,qs2QcycggWU,As a satcom student it’s a gem video for me.🥰💝💣
7788,qs2QcycggWU,Now do a deep dive into where the hell is my transceiver that I signed up for two years ago?
7789,qs2QcycggWU,"I mean, obviously."
7790,qs2QcycggWU,"Without details it’s not quite hard to understand :)
But it’s extremely painful to research 
Especially with company-own technology 

Thank you for your tremendous work!"
7791,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!!  Yeah, the actual math and signal processing is 1000x more complicated, but only really available to the companies who work on it."
7792,qs2QcycggWU,Much greater video than the sh*ty CSS guy :)
7793,qs2QcycggWU,Gonna watch this video using Starlink :D I'm very interested in the ground network and would love to see a video about it.
7794,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best STEM videos I have ever seen. Period.
7795,qs2QcycggWU,I want to give you guys infinite likes for this masterpiece of work but youtube would just crash and I already addicted to the best channel :(
7796,qs2QcycggWU,👌👌👌👌
7797,qs2QcycggWU,Are there sidelobes if the antennas are smaller than the wavelength? Because in that case it should behave as one single emitter and the beam would behave according to diffraction.
7798,qs2QcycggWU,very informative video...
7799,qs2QcycggWU,"Really cool explaination, now i know how i have internet on planes! Great video."
7800,qs2QcycggWU,"14:48 The intensity should be 4.5 million times higher, right? Because the power is 3'500 times higher but the beam is 1280 times tighter.
When you put two antennas together the amplitude is 2 times higher but the intensity is the amplitude square so 4 times higher."
7801,qs2QcycggWU,What do you mean by changing the phase (and amplitude) to send data? doesn't changing the phase change the direction at which we're pointing to the satellite?
7802,qs2QcycggWU,Not if all the antennas change phase the same way.
7803,qs2QcycggWU,"@@johntheux9238 Even if all the antennas do it, because of phase change, the direction will change and we'll no longer be pointing at the satellite directly, correct?"
7804,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BennyJosephPerepogu No, changing the phase means emitting the signal a bit sooner or later but it's exactly the same beam. To change the direction of the beam you need to emitt the signal at a different time from different antennas so that they cross at a different point in space."
7805,qs2QcycggWU,The beam direction is governed by the phase DIFFERENCES between all the elements. Any phase difference added equally to ALL the elements doesn't change that.
7806,qs2QcycggWU,​@@scienteer3562  Thanks I get it now
7807,qs2QcycggWU,@@johntheux9238 I didn't get you entirely but I hope you mean the same thing as @Scienteer.
7808,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate your great team to creating this opportunity to know things technology around us 👍
7809,qs2QcycggWU,You guys are such a quality channel. I love that you have the attention to detail to explain how things aren’t to scale and to assure you get it all right
7810,qs2QcycggWU,Its mind blowing that how much technology advanced in last 100 years and what height we will reach in next century.
7811,qs2QcycggWU,very well done vid
7812,qs2QcycggWU,My mind is blown right now 😳😳
7813,qs2QcycggWU,"Well, it's er, ""Brilliant"".  I may have missed it, but why 6 bit binary rather than a normal 8 bit?"
7814,qs2QcycggWU,"Really interesting and well presented!

With the same use of beamforming + steering and wireless charging. I can imagine maybe a room wide area which locates the phone and directs charge to it. Although the conversion would be low considering the inverse square law."
7815,qs2QcycggWU,Not if the beam is very tight.
7816,qs2QcycggWU,Most wireless charging systems I've seen work more like a transformer than an antenna.
7817,qs2QcycggWU,"Some of this I understood, but most of it is way over my head.  That being said, the sync signals between the two have got to be very precise!"
7818,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!!
7819,qs2QcycggWU,"Question: changing the direction of the beam uses phase shifting, but sending data also uses phase shifting, does that cause problems with beam direction?"
7820,qs2QcycggWU,"No, one use phase shifting from one antenna to another, the other shift all the antennas the same way."
7821,qs2QcycggWU,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
7822,qs2QcycggWU,I love learning how things work.. Though I didn't understand everything but I learned something 💯👌👌
7823,qs2QcycggWU,"It would have being nice to cover how the ground station work and also how the satellites talk to each other. Spoiler - lasers, or at least that how they use to say they will work."
7824,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing 💚 Thank you 🙏🏻
7825,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blown..!!  Really informative
7826,qs2QcycggWU,That was simpler that I thought to make beam formations. Thank you for making the video!
7827,qs2QcycggWU,wow
7828,qs2QcycggWU,The detail is splendid! Thank you keep blowing minds!
7829,qs2QcycggWU,Superb
7830,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblown
7831,qs2QcycggWU,Always amazed by the quality of your videos great work keep it up 👍
7832,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely beautiful
7833,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you
7834,qs2QcycggWU,"putting ""starlink"" or even ""elon musk's starlink"" on the title could boost the video in my opinion
plus it wouldn't even be clickbait"
7835,qs2QcycggWU,A lil credit please
7836,qs2QcycggWU,"Great vid! I think people should at least learn how the tech we use daily actually works. It's far more complex, and you would start to appreciate the engineering and design"
7837,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for the lesson
7838,qs2QcycggWU,"Apart from your skills, I admire also your perseverance. The tree is growing slowly but surely !"
7839,qs2QcycggWU,"OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE BEST TECH CHANNEL!"
7840,qs2QcycggWU,Super happy I found this channel! Unbelievably well made video (again) explaining just enough details without going frustratingly deep. 😍 Amazing work and thank you! 🎉 Also extra info in canadian captions is nice touch 👌🏼
7841,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks!!  Yeah.  Whenever I cut big sections of the script, I feel bad just throwing them away."
7842,qs2QcycggWU,"Tremendous work, kudos!"
7843,qs2QcycggWU,Super graet video..thank you so much for ur information.its very helpfull😭😊
7844,qs2QcycggWU,"It is very interesting and complicated, Thank you so much for making a lot easier to understand to general public (who are aware of basic terms). Loved the explanation."
7845,qs2QcycggWU,"This channel has got to be up there with some of the greatest. Through and through, time and time again, producing genuinely some of the best content. Thank you."
7846,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic!
7847,qs2QcycggWU,If you do the same dive into Hardware and Software it will be just awesome. But still never the less this is the best quality video about RF transmitting I even saw.
7848,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, Thank you for this Video!"
7849,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing video. Complex topic made not simple, but as simple as possible. You guys make understandable vids. Thanks. And gotta note and appreciate Elon musk and spaceX."
7850,qs2QcycggWU,"insanely amazing video! By the way, how are these animations made?"
7851,qs2QcycggWU,"This video is gold, so informative. please make more"
7852,qs2QcycggWU,"Unbelievable great video.  I am a computer engineering student and no normal Educational institution that i know can claim to inspire student and explain complicated topics at the same time as you guys. For my taste its the perfect mix between abstraction to let you understand the technology at a big scale and explaining the concepts behind this like phase shift. 

Well done keep going!"
7853,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video. Thanks for investing so much time to create such a masterpiece! I learned a lot and am amazed by how complex this technology is we use everyday.
7854,qs2QcycggWU,today I understand the necessity of research and development.
7855,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video as usual! I am thinking, if they use phase shifting to steer the beam and phase shifting to do the QAM64, how these two work together? The data sent is more or less random, how it can me combined with the phase shift for the steering?"
7856,qs2QcycggWU,"Easy, the first one use phase shifting between antennas, the other shift all the antennas the same way."
7857,qs2QcycggWU,Truly amazing video. The dept of explanation is awesome. Thank you!
7858,qs2QcycggWU,Very good video I like
7859,qs2QcycggWU,"This is wonderful! Thank you guys, you are keeping the quality and format on very high level. It's always a pleasure to see one of those, even if it takes a lot of time to prepare!"
7860,qs2QcycggWU,"DOUBT: around 6:40, you say that the feed line (the trace coming from the Microcontroller) wirelessly transmits the sin wave thing to the copper circle.. But wouldn't that happen with a 50-60Hz AC signal as well? Why do we need a 12GHz signal here? 
Or is it such that the 50-60Hz AC signal won't be able to create a EM radiation?"
7861,qs2QcycggWU,"You need a high frequency in order to be able to modulate the signal with a high data rate.  Also, viable antennas at only 50-60 Hz would be about 750 miles across (for a quarter wavelength antenna) and probably not fit in your back yard."
7862,qs2QcycggWU,"At the lower frequency there isn't much voltage difference over the length of the microstrip and patch, hence there isn't a significant electrical field generated between each side of the patch. All to do with the time it takes for the voltage to travel through the conductor (at near speed of light)."
7863,qs2QcycggWU,@@scienteer3562 Is there a relation with frequency of signals and amount of voltage induced in the other plate (conductor)?
7864,qs2QcycggWU,"@@AtAGlimpse_UB yes, but probably not how you imagine."
7865,qs2QcycggWU,"😮😮Awesome,Very Good Sir,Keep It Up.😮😮"
7866,qs2QcycggWU,"Branch education:  watch at 1.25x speed.
Me: my dumbass mind putting it in 0.5x to get it"
7867,qs2QcycggWU,"We need more such videos
And you need to be appreciated for your hard work, i can see that amount of work you have to do for animations and research🫡"
7868,qs2QcycggWU,One of the best YouTube channel ❣️❣️
7869,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing! Good job, keep going like this!"
7870,qs2QcycggWU,Epic educational video.
7871,qs2QcycggWU,I hope starlink can work on smartphones someday.
7872,qs2QcycggWU,Top notch quality video 🙃
7873,qs2QcycggWU,"Is the doppler effect due to the satellites moving towards & away from dishy at high speeds negligible here? Hmm, I guess I can do the math myself. 
(Velocity of satellite)/(2*antenna size) -> (7.7km/s)/(2*1.15 cm) -> 334 kHz = about 0.3 MHz = about 0.0003 GHz
This means that when the satellite moves towards dishy, the satellite will see at most 13.0003 GHz and when the satellite is moving away it will be at least 12.9997 GHz.
Yes, the doppler effect is negligible."
7874,qs2QcycggWU,"What a great video!!!
Thamk you for this opportunity to know about this amazing technology 👏"
7875,qs2QcycggWU,I found 25
7876,qs2QcycggWU,25
7877,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible!! This channel NEEDS millions of subs!!
7878,qs2QcycggWU,Can you please pin link for 45min log video
7879,qs2QcycggWU,"This is amazing, we dont appreciate the technology we have in hand until we pop up the hood and look underneath. And this channel does exactly that + mind = BLOWN ;)"
7880,qs2QcycggWU,Beautiful video! Thought out and well presented.
7881,qs2QcycggWU,I can't believe I'm watching this free.
7882,qs2QcycggWU,I appreciate this channel SO much. I wish any other science media had the guts to cover technology that is actually relevant and modern in such an understandable way. Huge props for the incredible work going into this. A broke engineering student thanks you!
7883,qs2QcycggWU,I can relate bud
7884,qs2QcycggWU,How the hell does man come up with this stuff! Very cool indeed. Love stuff like this. My dad was always into electronics. Heathkits back in the day. Also a ham operator. Then got an Apple][ computer. I myself ended up working in the IT field for over 20 years.
7885,qs2QcycggWU,I've never had another YouTuber recommend watching at something besides 1x playback speed. These guys really know their audience.
7886,qs2QcycggWU,I will not bore you with your excellence. 💌
7887,qs2QcycggWU,"Mind blowing 😀
I just revised all concepts of my grad school 🤣 in just 28 min."
7888,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow. I had no idea it was so complex. I remember the old satellite internet systems, how slow they were and you still needed to have a dial up internet to upload data. What a masterpiece of technology Elon Musk has built. Thank you for explaining it so eloquently Branch Education! Liked, subscribed and commented :)"
7889,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  We appreciate it!
7890,qs2QcycggWU,Watching this on my Starlink internet.  Perfect!
7891,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video. if you’re looking for a constructive comment, perhaps you could add some resources from credible journals too. Once again, amazing video!"
7892,qs2QcycggWU,So excellent! I have been wanting to see a video about Starlink like this for so long! <3
7893,qs2QcycggWU,"Do the satellites send signals between themselves? If so then how because the 4 dishes on each satellite highlighted in the video don't seem to be able to do so. Also, is each satellite rotating while in orbit in order to always face towards the ground?"
7894,qs2QcycggWU,Wooow
7895,qs2QcycggWU,You all 100% deserve my subscribion. Oml this was so detailed amazing job! This needs more views which I sure will happen!
7896,qs2QcycggWU,"You are my favorite channel right now, I love it"
7897,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is revolutionary, bringing modern internet speeds to rural and remote areas. 
It's not as fast or reliable as fiber optic line,  but is the last step to bringing decent internet to most humans wherever they are."
7898,qs2QcycggWU,This is brilliant!
7899,qs2QcycggWU,"The love, effort and thought put into these videos are just as mind-blowing as the technology itself!"
7900,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!   We appreciate it.
7901,qs2QcycggWU,we need more of this on the internet!
7902,qs2QcycggWU,Starlink makes everything easy being the only advanced technology for the whole world to make everything easy.
7903,qs2QcycggWU,This information is truly priceless! Thank you for sharing!
7904,qs2QcycggWU,"this channel is awesome, keep it up <3"
7905,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow, whoever invented this stuff is smarter than I."
7906,qs2QcycggWU,"He branch education make a video on binary codes how computer lagaungee made and how codes upgrade with time and working mchanism full ,love ur videos"
7907,qs2QcycggWU,By far my only subscription and notification channel in youtube
7908,qs2QcycggWU,So deep
7909,qs2QcycggWU,great video!!
7910,qs2QcycggWU,Woah thats awesome engineering Marvel. Hays off for the enginner's who work on this type of things.
7911,qs2QcycggWU,"18:38 / Could i know why can’t we see differences in phase shifted visible light?
Visible light and micro wave is same electromagnatic wave so i think it should work same way through phased array LED"
7912,qs2QcycggWU,That's way more in-depth than I though it would be. Amazing!
7913,qs2QcycggWU,Probably the best engineering educational content on YouTube. Amazing
7914,qs2QcycggWU,"I will watch it tomorrow, with an open mind, now gonna sleep."
7915,qs2QcycggWU,I am glad you didn't use 'freedom' units. Metric is the best.
7916,qs2QcycggWU,What an amazing work you have done here to make me understand the principle of this awesome technology! Thank you all so very much! Love your content!!!
7917,qs2QcycggWU,Shout out to Dishy Mcflatface.
7918,qs2QcycggWU,How does the satellite communicate with multiple dishes?
7919,qs2QcycggWU,"great video! It's so much easier to learn with animations, thanks so much"
7920,qs2QcycggWU,"Love your work, so good"
7921,qs2QcycggWU,"Just wondering, how does phase shifting during signal transfer not affect the dish’s area of constructive interference?"
7922,qs2QcycggWU,I greatly appreciate the TO SCALE models!
7923,qs2QcycggWU,"I greatly appreciate videos like these! Subscribed, liked, commented, and hit the bell button!"
7924,qs2QcycggWU,"Your videos are so good! If I may give a tip from a dumb user's perspective... I suspect your thumbnails could use some work. I keep on missing them in my subscription feed. Not sure why, maybe they're too cluttered or something. Just an idea, I'd love to see your channel grow as much as possible!!"
7925,qs2QcycggWU,Just wow of both the technology and the explaination.
7926,qs2QcycggWU,Love it 🙂👍
7927,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
7928,qs2QcycggWU,Wow. This is impressive.
7929,qs2QcycggWU,wow
7930,qs2QcycggWU,This makes me moist
7931,qs2QcycggWU,"Nice video, but Starlink is crap, space junk, it has a small lifespan and their internet service is too expensive"
7932,qs2QcycggWU,I am using Dishy Mcflatface and I am still having lag...
7933,qs2QcycggWU,I love this channel so much
7934,qs2QcycggWU,Keep up the good work with this channel!
7935,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow! This is incredible in two way. Number one,  the level of detail in the video. Number two the complexity of satellite internet. That you for making this!"
7936,qs2QcycggWU,Really interesting.. like it keep on going
7937,qs2QcycggWU,"Ubiquitous, but anisotropic in the presence of a mass body, the Aether shall set us free. Just rotate the Michelson-Morley Interferometer vertically to find out. 😉"
7938,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for a great video.
7939,qs2QcycggWU,This is real mind blowing how am seeing the physics and math I did some years ago applies in advanced tech
7940,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video ... Great job
7941,qs2QcycggWU,"I don't think there can be a better YouTube channel than this
And yes this is the first time I've commented something like this"
7942,qs2QcycggWU,The video would have been better without all of the Musk-isms.
7943,qs2QcycggWU,Huh??
7944,qs2QcycggWU,You managed to explain hard topics  in a very visual and easy to understand way! Thank you
7945,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome detailing on this subject.
7946,qs2QcycggWU,"Loved the great details in this video, all of your videos are great.  This is one of my favorites so far.  I would watch then every day if you could put them out that quick, but I understand it takes a ton of research and work to get one video done.  Keep up the great work!"
7947,qs2QcycggWU,Glad you enjoyed it!  Also thanks for being a supporter and sticking with us!
7948,qs2QcycggWU,I would easily watch a 45 minutes video so well made and interesting. Thanks for the awesome content you publish!
7949,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely brilliant explanation!
7950,qs2QcycggWU,Really great visual!! People dream of internet everywhere for a long time.
7951,qs2QcycggWU,Wow....great video. Never looked into the antenna besides the few with cats laying within them
7952,qs2QcycggWU,Really wish I had these videos when I was still in school. Just amazing quality all around.
7953,qs2QcycggWU,Perfect beautiful video ! So good explanation
7954,qs2QcycggWU,mans content here is about to bankrupt universities
7955,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video man, I really appreciate your hard work"
7956,qs2QcycggWU,Mindblowing video
7957,qs2QcycggWU,Absolutely incredible educational content. Please keep doing more! There's nothing like this on youtube.
7958,qs2QcycggWU,Thanks!  We appreciate it!
7959,qs2QcycggWU,I spotted 12 shooting stars 🔭🤩
7960,qs2QcycggWU,Amazing video as always! :)
7961,qs2QcycggWU,"After all, I've always wondered how beamforming actually works! Great explanation! I was often confused by 64 QAM, but your explanation immediately makes it clear how it works (at least on a broad scale). I really appreciate the videos, keep up the good work!"
7962,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!  Glad to help you understand these topics.
7963,qs2QcycggWU,"Best video so far, amazing! On sidenote, I wouldn't have minded a 45 min version ;)"
7964,qs2QcycggWU,"I really appreciate your hard work, thank you so much 🙏"
7965,qs2QcycggWU,24 stars seen; want to work with Branch Education in future videos
7966,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for this informative video.  The way of your presentation was fabulous.
7967,qs2QcycggWU,mindblowing indeed 😮
7968,qs2QcycggWU,I have been watching since the third video you posted and it is amazing how each video improves on the last through format changes. Entertaining and educational is a hard thing to do and this channel excels at it.
7969,qs2QcycggWU,Care to make a sequel explaining how the satellites handoff connections to the ground antenna?
7970,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, i hope it gets viral and get tons of views"
7971,qs2QcycggWU,I was mindblown to the level of explanation done to this very complex topic that everyone could understand
7972,qs2QcycggWU,Very cool video! You made a complex subject understandable.  Thank you and please make more.
7973,qs2QcycggWU,I really really appreciate for the high quality video.
7974,qs2QcycggWU,"1:34 Life Hack: Just watch the Video one time at 3x Speed, no problem :)"
7975,qs2QcycggWU,Fantastic Video keep up the good work
7976,qs2QcycggWU,"Wow!!! Interference to form an beam, this is genius! Engineering rock!"
7977,qs2QcycggWU,Impeccable content. I wish they taught us the same way in university
7978,qs2QcycggWU,"Anyone wishing to see Starlink Dish from the inside : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmdQnIlnRo 
By : Ken Keiter"
7979,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video as always!
Q : can we expect 4K videos anytime soon on the channel?

Edit : Okay I just watched 22:00 I think 1080p is fine and good😅"
7980,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah-  I think we can get to 4k soon.  It just adds a lot of extra rendering time- but once we get to be a larger channel, we'll 100% switch all our videos to 4k."
7981,qs2QcycggWU,"You know they put more value on what people learn than how much money the video makes, when they recommend watching it at 1.25 or 1.5 speed, knowing that youtube will consider the video as having less watch time when people watch it at increased speed. I love when a channel values my time."
7982,qs2QcycggWU,"I had to laugh when it was recommended to play faster than normal speed. I have post surgery cognition issues and my brain is fogged up a lot from the pain meds,, so I've been playing all my YouTube videos and movies at 0.75 or three quarters speed just to be able to follow and understand the storylines and presentations."
7983,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome video thanks.
7984,qs2QcycggWU,"Please keep creating such quality videos.

Also I wished you would have shown how data is transferred in an area with a lot of dishy communicating to a single Starlink satellite. Maybe in a future video."
7985,qs2QcycggWU,"This is up there with kurzgesagt in terms of quality, but the channel has less than a million subscribers??! Good job and thank you for this awesome educational content.

Question: what is an in-depth answer for why people are getting less internet speed now that there are more people using starlink?"
7986,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video please keep ´em comin´ 😍🙏
7987,qs2QcycggWU,It was a perfect gift to my brain cells. Thank you!
7988,qs2QcycggWU,"If my math teacher would have showed me this video 15 years ago I would have understood why math is useful in life. How all those apparently boring formulas are applied to technologies, why we need to understand them in order to benefit from technologies that now we give for granted but actually aren't."
7989,qs2QcycggWU,Now this is what YouTube was made for
7990,qs2QcycggWU,"Probably it's way more complicated than highschool physics but I'll ask anyways.

8:58 Current is flowing to the left so shouldn't the yellow magnetic field using the right hand rule be pointing towards us?
Amazing video btw."
7991,qs2QcycggWU,I saw 24 shooting stars
7992,qs2QcycggWU,"This should be curriculum material, like actually shown in schools."
7993,qs2QcycggWU,"Thats, the goal.  To supplement curricula with in depth real world tech"
7994,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video!
7995,qs2QcycggWU,this is insane
7996,qs2QcycggWU,"Great video, I would love watch it with quality 4k or at least 1440p.
Quality Content like this looks better with also hi-q of image :)"
7997,qs2QcycggWU,For real the best channel for explanations
7998,qs2QcycggWU,Incredible thank you a lot for this information.... i'm speechless
7999,qs2QcycggWU,Great video.
8000,qs2QcycggWU,The amount of science and engineering here to make this product work is absolutely astounding. This is marvel of human creation. Thank you so much for curating and bringing this information to us plebs.
8001,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you for watching and commenting!!
8002,qs2QcycggWU,Excellent video 👌👌
8003,qs2QcycggWU,Way cool. Very interesting process. I'm glad there are smart people in the world who understand all this stuff.
8004,qs2QcycggWU,"Hello Zack, it's nice that you too like these type of videos. Have a great day."
8005,qs2QcycggWU,cool
8006,qs2QcycggWU,It is the job of an engineer man
8007,qs2QcycggWU,Nice to see you here Zack
8008,qs2QcycggWU,"Hey! Jerry, don't u think Elon musk is a con artist? He is just lying to his investors and the customers, his cars are a safety hazard"
8009,qs2QcycggWU,Wuhh! Jerry is hear 🙂🙏
8010,qs2QcycggWU,"Thats only part of it. Took someone with some bold vision. There is a reason why no one really has created a LEO system like this. The sats fall out of orbit every 4-5 years. Takes massive capital to start, massive capital to maintain all inherently linked to massive subscriber base. The window for this to succeed is small. I love it. Has changed how I work and RV."
8011,qs2QcycggWU,Hi Jerry
8012,qs2QcycggWU,Jerry
8013,qs2QcycggWU,Im also glad there are people willing to disassemble other people work just to see how it work. Thanks for your service Jerry :)
8014,qs2QcycggWU,Get lost Zack.
8015,qs2QcycggWU,@@DarkGT you get lost
8016,qs2QcycggWU,@@sakracliche Zack first.
8017,qs2QcycggWU,@@flowteczech 😇😹
8018,qs2QcycggWU,@@DarkGT that's not nice
8019,qs2QcycggWU,"actually we do , but what is really  hard thing is what you're doing ?! (damaging mobiles 🤗😁)"
8020,qs2QcycggWU,So when do we see you rigging up this dishy? 🤔
8021,qs2QcycggWU,Exactly Jerry I agree with you.
8022,qs2QcycggWU,"no, not cool at all. it's cringy."
8023,qs2QcycggWU,Jerry how about JerryRig McDishi
8024,qs2QcycggWU,you don't even need starlink you live in a big city lol
8025,qs2QcycggWU,@@altafvhora lol… didn’t he already make a video regarding starlink ?
8026,qs2QcycggWU,Aliens for sure! Not human. I've seeing how microwave oven works. Im sure its not human made.
8027,qs2QcycggWU,Wow hello
8028,qs2QcycggWU,When we have Scratch test of dishy?
8029,qs2QcycggWU,"het jerry, when can we see you ripping one of these space tech...."
8030,qs2QcycggWU,"Re: “Don't Let DISH Disable Your Internet - VoterVoice.” Around July 6, Elon tweeted that Dish’s excessive hoarding of 12GHz channels will kill Starlink (& revenues needed to sustain SpaceX/Starships). How is Elon’s fight to get the FCC to rein Dish in going?"
8031,qs2QcycggWU,"next, he will break down the Start Link Dish himself"
8032,qs2QcycggWU,This is not that complicated. You learn about most of this stuff in the standard university physics course.. Just 4 months is enough to learn about most of it if you try hard enough.
8033,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah not everyone likes destroying technology
8034,qs2QcycggWU,Mah dudes still in it! Much love Jerry the Rig!
8035,qs2QcycggWU,"Zach!!!!

Care to rip this up anytime soon?"
8036,qs2QcycggWU,@@abhilekh8992 it's a test of might
8037,qs2QcycggWU,@@Crunch_dGH I'm reading it right now
8038,qs2QcycggWU,"@AathmaVTPRL hey,  noce to hear that,  btw what do you do? Like,  now? Are of out of India or Living abroad?"
8039,qs2QcycggWU,It's time to tear down starlink.
8040,qs2QcycggWU,this is the most generic comment I've ever seen
8041,qs2QcycggWU,ARE YOU ALL THIS STU.PID?
8042,qs2QcycggWU,Did anyone else just hear a finger snap? Let’s get started 🤣
8043,qs2QcycggWU,I want your cell phone that you destroyed give me i no have phone
8044,qs2QcycggWU,This is high school level physics. Good students know that.
8045,qs2QcycggWU,ayo when we getting a durability test on the starlink?
8046,qs2QcycggWU,Jerry wants to check the durability of starlink satalite
8047,qs2QcycggWU,When will you do a durability test for dishy? I would like to see if it will makes a deeper grooves on the scratch test
8048,qs2QcycggWU,So easy to fool the generations after 2000. You show them some cartoons and they believe it. No critical thinking at all.
8049,qs2QcycggWU,"Dude, are you not aware of the truth yet?  Earth is not a globe, universe doesn't exist, sun & moon are the same size, made up of plasma hovering above our flat earth. If earth goes around the sun, then why do we see same stars for all 12 months? Shouldn't we see different stars on different directions? Globe liars got busted once again😁 solar system, big bang, planets are fake (photoshop). Are you people even real?
 Michaelson-Morley and Airy's experiment were supposed to prove the earth's rotation, but those proved the earth doesn't spin, they bite the dust, many experiments ended up with the result of non-moving flat surface. WELCOME TO REALITY. UNIVERSE DOESN'T EXIST. 
Governments , nasa, isro have been lying this whole time."
8050,qs2QcycggWU,"If earth and atmosphere spin 1600 KMph in the eastward direction, then flights traveling west at max speed 1000 KMph, must be having hard time to cruise and would never reach its westward destination. But in real life scenario, flights reach the destinations between A and B at the same duration regardless of the direction. This one fact alone is enough to prove that the earth is NOT a spinning ball, but rather a flat disk.. Globe model is illuminati deception, and it's been busted.. checkmate.."
8051,qs2QcycggWU,"Satellites don't exist. GPS not working in ocean. GPS is just the triangulation of cell towers. Internet cables are buried under the ocean. Time to wake up. Trust your senses..
_ Satellites don't exist. Those are cartoons. Men send signals to the sky at an angle (a solid dome placed by our Creator), and it reflects those signals back to flat plane(earth) at same angle. Everything is stable, the ground antenna that sends, the earth, the dome, the ground antenna that receives. Universe, solar system do not exist. Are you saying there are bus sized tin objects that float above our heads about 700 km which is supposedly 2000 C hot and doesn't melt the trash cans(so-called satellites) ??
_ Does it feel like we are travelling at 66600 mph around the sun? Earth inclined 23.4 degree? 90 -23.4 = 66.6 now you see it's 666 everywhere.. it's the devil's number.. YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. 
 _ Why mercury and venus show up in the night sky? Can any scientist (Illuminati) explain this? No. All 12 months, we see the same stars in the night sky, but we should see some other stars which are in the other side for 6 months. Globe is busted again.
 _ Antarctica is the surrounding 300 ft. tall ice wall of our flat earth, and illuminati won't let anyone near by to discover that the world is flat, it's the most guarded place on flat earth. There is a treaty signed by 50 countries that no man can get to Antarctica, because it's the surrounding wall of our flat earth, and it extends very far."
8052,qs2QcycggWU,"No curvature evidence, no spinning evidence, no Antarctica circumnavigation, releasing fake cgi images, yet they are yelling that we are traveling on a stupid ball with high pressure air rubbing against vacuum. What a pathetic bunch of losers. Their cognitive dissonance won't let them realize that earth is flat and non-moving.
_ If you dare, can you point your finger at the direction that your hilarious ball earth is flying at 100,000 kmph speed in any given time? Just look at the clouds , how calm they are, does it feel like those clouds also got dragged by this stupid ball at 100,000 kmph? Pathetic. Shame on those who believe globe earth nonsense, globers keep whining but still they don't have a single proof that earth is flying, spinning, or having curvature. 2022 is the year of waking up."
8053,qs2QcycggWU,Cool
8054,qs2QcycggWU,@@Almighty_Flat_Earth this one and the author of the video are like that ahole from matrix that betrayed all team to comeback into the matrix. We have a spiritual war. Some are very aware on what side they are.
8055,qs2QcycggWU,"@@Almighty_Flat_Earth weird that I can see you. They work hard to disconnect us. 😂 
 See you some day brother 🙏"
8056,qs2QcycggWU,Synthetic Aperture Radar Technology commercially back ported from pentagon research DARPA project innovation to commercial beam steering phased array Starling Satellite Internet system & base stations & user antenna wifi router setups // a mind bending look at the technology!
8057,qs2QcycggWU,Planning on taking apart the satellite? 😅😅😁
8058,qs2QcycggWU,"Oh Hey Jerry, Didn't see you coming"
8059,qs2QcycggWU,"Next on @JerryRigEverything
Dishy Durability Test :)"
8060,qs2QcycggWU,That is exactly what I was thinking

Satellite Teardown......"
8062,qs2QcycggWU,"You are not one of them, tho. Too bad u have the voice to show it."
8063,qs2QcycggWU,Scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7😎
8064,qs2QcycggWU,Hey jerry. Whats up man? :)
8065,qs2QcycggWU,"https://youtu.be/6Y5n4ap-Wx0

🤣🤣🤣🤣"
8066,qs2QcycggWU,Next video: Whats inside a Starlink dish?
8067,qs2QcycggWU,I own a starlink dish and it is awesome to see the technology I have invested in and how it functions.
8068,qs2QcycggWU,Waiting for the teardown of this starlink antenna
8069,qs2QcycggWU,Yo ! Jerry
8070,qs2QcycggWU,I am also glad there are people who wouldn't bat an eye before breaking them open.
8071,qs2QcycggWU,@@stolearovigor281 cut the bullshit
8072,qs2QcycggWU,😳.  I love your content too! how's the electric hummer coming along. great I hope
8073,qs2QcycggWU,Not my cuppa tea
8074,qs2QcycggWU,Can we get a tear down of it 😁 that will be fun
8075,qs2QcycggWU,"Hi jerry, i like your videos"
8076,qs2QcycggWU,Hey Jerry live your channel to
8077,qs2QcycggWU,"Zack you should do a "" does it scratch test "" on Dishy :))"
8078,qs2QcycggWU,Yeah absolutely
8079,qs2QcycggWU,😳😳
8080,qs2QcycggWU,I have Starlink Jerry I’m texting from space right now!
8081,qs2QcycggWU,"Jerry!
Now break this!😀"
8082,qs2QcycggWU,ok jig.. please rig starlink antenna
8083,qs2QcycggWU,"I'd hoped, I'm one of those 😄😅"
8084,qs2QcycggWU,Without those people we couldn't have this stuff
8085,qs2QcycggWU,"Zack, you should do a durability test on this thing"
8086,qs2QcycggWU,"@JerryRigEverything Rig One, for Science"
8087,qs2QcycggWU,My idol is here too!! Haha nice
8088,qs2QcycggWU,Don't you have content to be making you egghead? 🥚
8089,qs2QcycggWU,"The people who understand this aren’t 
From this world 😉"
8090,qs2QcycggWU,AND....on our side !
8091,qs2QcycggWU,Zaaack
8092,qs2QcycggWU,To be honest the concept is rather basic and simple even someone like me with some basic understanding of physics can understand but actually creating and developinging the tech and integrating all of it in a package while also preparing the product for mass production. Now that is amazing. Apart from engineering challenges the logistics that took to come to this point is so commendable. I don't like Elon but his company employees are freaking fantastic.
8093,qs2QcycggWU,It's a computer with antennae.
8094,qs2QcycggWU,@Novelist C.V Rajamma enjoying your transistor and flip flop theory??

8110,qs2QcycggWU,😁 hehe . So you got time to watch other's video??
8111,qs2QcycggWU,Too bad you're constantly shitting on the guy that made it possible. Perhaps you should stop stomping on his sack?
8112,qs2QcycggWU,And able to explain it us as well

8127,qs2QcycggWU,Hi Jerry 👋
8128,qs2QcycggWU,Can't wait to see JerryRig take this apart 😂
8129,qs2QcycggWU,"But the important question is, does it scratch at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7?"
8130,qs2QcycggWU,@@DarkGT Such a troll 😅
8131,qs2QcycggWU,"Are you going to rig Starlink, Jerry?"
8132,qs2QcycggWU,Me too.  We truly are living the future
8133,qs2QcycggWU,You can too! You just need time and a stage in your life where you're ready to sit back and focus on one thing. It's taken a lot of work by a lot of different proud people to get here!!! And you are certainly not excluded

8150,qs2QcycggWU,Bro you are here😂
8151,qs2QcycggWU,"I love your channel Jerry!!! This works because it is a ground-based technology, that has been around for a very very long time. Elon was offered access to sell this tech because the move to cellular digital access has made this less and less relevant. They took this failing tech and found a way to make it profitable again, by tying it into fake “outer-space”"
8152,qs2QcycggWU,And i thought i fail to understand half of even your videos because i am not smart enough😅😅. This went way above my head.

8158,qs2QcycggWU,I'm really enjoying the step by step explanation. Many thanks to the team for putting this together.
8159,qs2QcycggWU,"Yeah, unfortunately they got their idea by Elon.
The original idea came from a small Mexican company, even the name was trademarked since 2015"

8166,qs2QcycggWU,wait until blue origin pays him to shit on starlink as well
8167,qs2QcycggWU,While watching this video I went to your channel to check if you have opened the starlink device to show us the inside of it and to give us more explanation of that
8168,qs2QcycggWU,best educational youtube chanel
8169,qs2QcycggWU,I'm absolutey fascinated by that technology and you creat the best educational videos one can find by far. Thank you for this masterpiece and keep up the good work!

8180,qs2QcycggWU,@@beaconing7689 Good question
8181,qs2QcycggWU,@@dionysschub5350 YouTube censors wrong think comments
8182,qs2QcycggWU,They forgot to mention the first phased array antenna was demonstrated in 1909.  Over 110 years ago.
8183,qs2QcycggWU,the tech behind it is what powers the latest radars in american fighters
8184,qs2QcycggWU,There is zero innovation in Starlink. It is objectively bad for humanity that Starlink exists

8224,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome
8225,qs2QcycggWU,Came to see the technology behind starlink.. but blown away by the quality and content of the video
8226,qs2QcycggWU,"This is one of my favorite YouTube channels. It gives enough detail for everything to make sense but doesn't get lost in the weeds. I can do further research on my own if I am more curious about specific details.

 It adds a new level of excitement to my dishy. Starlink has changed my life. Out in the boondocks we've been neglected by our monopolies for decades. I'm finally able to do things that I couldn't dream of. A whole family trying to use four megabits is a nightmare!"
8227,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, great to hear that Starlink has helped you!  Hopefully, it keeps staying as great as it has been."
8228,qs2QcycggWU,"Thank you so much for sharing such an amazing content for free.

Note : I have seen 24 meteors"
8229,qs2QcycggWU,uhhh whoaaw????
8230,qs2QcycggWU,This channel is sooo underrated 😳😳
8231,qs2QcycggWU,I counted 25 shooting stars.
8232,qs2QcycggWU,"Amazing stuff. As much as I chagrin that we still burn hydrocarbons for power and cut people with knives for surgery, this stuff makes me feel like we have one foot in the 'future' presented to us in sci fi."
8233,qs2QcycggWU,"15:10 I like the way u ignore 
Those formulas😂😂
""So let's move on"""
8234,qs2QcycggWU,Its incredible what we as a species is capable of. Just WOW! Thanks for the upload! Its hard to believe content like this is free.
8235,qs2QcycggWU,Well Done video Mind Blown Keep the good work up
8236,qs2QcycggWU,"Finally, I have always wondered how beamforming actually works! Great explanation! 64 QAM was new to me but your explanation made it instantly clear how it works (at least at a broad level). I really appreciate these videos, keep them coming!"
8237,qs2QcycggWU,"there are many many different modulation methods, shorter range radios can encode 8 bits at a time. the more bits you encode the more data you can pack into it, however the more susceptible it is to interference and errors. the whole point of digital over analog was precisely because it was much more resilient to errors in transmission.
in this constant chase of faster data rates, digital is becoming less and less digital but more and more analog."
8238,qs2QcycggWU,"Current mobile devices and WiFi Access points are capable of 1024 QAM.. Starlink is behind current telecommunication protocols.. as of today is just a ""for show"" system."
8239,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium calling starlink a ""for show system"" in the basis that the modulation uses less bits than bleeding edge wifi is ignorant. as explained in my comment, more dense modulation comes at the cost of higher error rate. it works fine for shorter ranges with low interference, but you're not going to make it work well beaming the signal from orbit using frequencies over 10 GHz."
8240,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Oh don't get confused.. it is a for show system based on the premise that the requirements of abundant ground stations renders the low orbit infraestructura useless..
The quadrature amplitude modulation example was addressed to the person at the original comment.. which seems to have just discovered its workings."
8241,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium the point is not ""abundant ground stations"", which only matters for regional areas, it doesn't impact stations in the other side of the continent.
the point of starlink is to provide usable internet anywhere in the world. it's not meant to replace optic fiber, which is what you seem to be assuming.
other than satellite, you're just not going to get internet at a feasible cost any other way to a remote island, for example."
8242,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr No.. Im assuming you haven't noticed a wireless system which requires also a lot of ground stations without the need for recurrent space missions.
8243,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium i do in fact work at an ISP and we use radio towers.
i think i'd know first hand the limitations of these.
good luck getting to a very remote rural area this way. if the area doesn't have high enough demand to justify all the radio repeaters, they either have no internet at all or use a geostationary satellite. starlink is a massive step-up from that."
8244,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You are mixing the benefits of geostationary with low orbit and ironically omitting the drawbacks.
8245,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium a low orbit constellation is obviously a lot more expensive to maintain, but they're doing it. i don;'t know what more proof of concept you need. didn't he say in this video they already have 500k customers? do the math."
8246,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr So if you read carefully you are going to notice within my comments how I attribute the success of the company to their reliance on people NOT knowing a thing about technology.
8247,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr Or do you really think Starlink could have financed the project if they told everyone that for it to work as promised they need to discard 90% of the satellites?
8248,qs2QcycggWU,@@absolutium discard 90% of the satellites? what are you even talking about?
8249,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You didn't knew? Well look at it..
8250,qs2QcycggWU,@@absolutium how about you just explain instead?
8251,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Well if you ask any person how Starlink works most people assume (dont know why) that the data is comming from space and that they are communicating to other parts of the world without ""touching"" the earth until the data's destination is reached..."
8252,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr You and I know that is B.S.. 
What people also don't know is that the satellite array has a laughable lifespan (arguably by choice) which will require that the vast majority of the device in orbit gets replaced.."
8253,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr So the array in place is a test.. Yet at a cost of half a million dollar per satellite and 15 million per launch.. do you really think that Starlink is the cost effective solution (for rural areas) when all that (unnecessary) work has to be destroyed for it to be compliant with the original promises and expectations?
8254,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium how is that relevant, at all?
first of all, the end consumer couldn't care less if the company they're buying services from is profitable or if it does things differently than what they imagine.
at the end of the day consumers only really care about 2 things:
1) is it cheaper than alternatives?
2) does it work better than alternatives?
that's it. everything else is just trivia to them.

now, for your argument that it's just ""for show"" because the constellation has a small lifespan, what you're ultimately trying to say is that they can't turn a profit on it.
mind you, uber had never made profit until 2021. same with tesla.
these massive companies doing something nobody else is doing can take a decade of bleeding billions of dollars on expansion until they turn profit.
i wonder if 5 years ago you'd be saying the same about those companies."
8255,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr You are missing the fact that an IPO is based on public perception.. what do you think would be the worlds consensus if they noticed the Eco-minded guy just wasted not only billions of dollars from subsidies investors and consumers into a project he knows won't work as is.. but that the outrageous carbon footprint was for nothing..
8256,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr It is for show as they did knew the thousands of satellites deployed weren't  capable of intercomunication among the nods.
8257,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr At a fraction of the energy toll LTE+ could have been easily deployed until they knew how to do wjat the promised.. why? Because ground stations were still deployed.
8258,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium please say what you have to say in a single comment...
anyway you keep making more and more outrageous claims and i'm not so free on time that i'd want to keep debunking so let's leave it at that."
8259,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr ..That's just an example with a team of 6 we managed to establish Metropolitan Area Network for a financial institution with around 40km wireless communications at over 200Mbps
Do you really think that a multi-billion dollar organization is uncapable of doing 50x better?"
8260,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium omnidirectional radio towers are in fact more expensive, use more pwoer and are slower than directional radio dishes.
again, i'd know, i work with both, we're an ISP. i have real expertise in this area, so you're really barking up the wrong tree here."
8261,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr The minute I pulled costs into the equation you went on a rant saying I keep bringing new topics.. but now you seem to think a single space trip is less expensive than any of both technologies I mentioned? 
So costs just happen according to your cable guy perception??
Also if you work deploying telecom infrastructure you know omnidirectional radio proyection within cellular network is mostly a combination of directional arrays."
8262,qs2QcycggWU,"@@absolutium now you're just appealing to lying about things i said and didn't say.
good day sir. you're not only beyond reason, but willing to lie."
8263,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr Fortunatelly you can Read again the comments so you notice how your initial argument talked  cost... without even knowing what was the measure for comparison.
8264,qs2QcycggWU,"@@BattousaiHBr Yes - also to keep the latency down to 20 milliseconds, the satellites 🛰 need to be closer to the ground. However, as mentioned in the video, an orbiting satellite constellation is much harder to manage than a single geostationary satellite. But with improvements in electronics, software and network technologies, the Starlink system is still in its infancy."
8265,qs2QcycggWU,Great video
8266,qs2QcycggWU,"3:50 why are you saying ""aloomemum"" when the element clearly is called ""Aluminium""? this feels really strange on this great channel...."
8267,qs2QcycggWU,Wow guys that is amazing.  I would have designed the system a lot different though.  I would have used green/blue lasers and a telescopic lense system with stepper motor tracking.  Might need 2 telescopes however so one could be transceiving while the other re-aligning / waiting for next sequential satilite orbit.  Not sure if lasers could penetrate cloud and rain - maybe that's why starlink uses high frequency radio transmission.
8268,qs2QcycggWU,"many, many things wrong with your method.
first, you cant do that due to regulations. doubt the governments of the world would allow you to beam back and forth hundreds of thousands of visible light lasers in the night sky.
also price matters. lasers aren't exactly cheap. i work with optic fibers and a simple 1gbps transceiver is not cheap, now imagine how many you'd need in a compact space to achieve a phased-array antenna.
also logistics and feasibility of launching thousands of telescopes to space and at everyone's homes...

also my dude, common sense humility......
no way you, a random nobody, would be able to come up in a few minutes with a better solution than dozens of some of the world's best engineers in their respective fields over several years......."
8269,qs2QcycggWU,"This is definitely an informative video.  And as they sa in the video, they spent the time researching and the topic and re-writing things as they went and tehn the video production time being like 2 months just for this video.

For us that know little about the 'science' of it this is a great video to get the main points. Though to think of the knowledge it takes to actually design these things is a matter of great appreciation for what humans can do with God's things :)"
8270,qs2QcycggWU,"Thanks, its a great video resulted from great efforts...i deed
But Why h.264 ?
Why not h.265 ?"
8271,qs2QcycggWU,Mind blowing. A great learning video.
8272,qs2QcycggWU,love this video
8273,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome very educational video :) spectacular work
8274,qs2QcycggWU,I do not understand any of this but I find it very interesting.
8275,qs2QcycggWU,"The fact that great educational content like this gets less views & financial support than mindless entertainment videos on youtube shows that the politicians don't do their job well. We need to tax mindless entertainment more and use that money to then subsidize educational content more. that way more people will be motivated to create educational content instead of mindless one and also the kids would get more educated, too! 
At the end of the day we humans all want to have fun but if we educate ourselves and invent cool technologies now then we will be able to have even more fun and also more time for fun activities in the future"
8276,qs2QcycggWU,"As soon as you mentioned phase shift, it immediately clicked to me how the steering would work. I was pretty proud of myself at the moment because I consider myself dumb. Thanks for all the effort and time spent on this great video."
8277,qs2QcycggWU,Thank you!!  Glad to help you recognize how smart you truly are!
8278,qs2QcycggWU,I counted 21 shooting stars. Fantastic video as always!
8279,qs2QcycggWU,Awesome! Thanks guys!
8280,qs2QcycggWU,"Absolute insanity in production, once again. I hope more teachers will realise the value of these kind of videos"
8281,qs2QcycggWU,Is it sufficient to use one big antenna instead of 1280 antennas?
8282,qs2QcycggWU,The beam would be fixed. To track the satellites would require moving the dish at incredible speeds. The passed array onboard the satellites actually needs to hop the pointing between lots of ground stations which is even harder.
8283,qs2QcycggWU,"20 shooting Stars

8284,qs2QcycggWU,thank you love this content

8286,qs2QcycggWU,Best video on this topic so far.
8287,qs2QcycggWU,"damn this is Chaos then i thought
thanks!"
8288,qs2QcycggWU,16
8289,qs2QcycggWU,"Small nitpicks - in the orbital animation at 2:50 TV satellites should be shown to be geostationary, orbiting above the same area as the earth rotates. This is important because it explains why TV dishes can point at a single point in the sky, while Starlink beams need to be electronically steered. Furthermore, while the earth is correctly shown as rotating counterclockwise from the north pole, both satellites are orbiting in the wrong direction, east to west, while nearly all satellites orbit west to east to take advantage of earth's velocity.

Overall though, very nice video that explains complex electronic and communications concepts."
8290,qs2QcycggWU,Thx for the added details
8291,qs2QcycggWU,"well starlink also needs to transmit signals, so not only the movement of the satellites is what requires it to be electronically steered (phase arrayed)"
8292,qs2QcycggWU,Yes the retrograde orbits love it! Doesn't look like many people noticed though don't see very many comments. I think somebody got too focused on explaining phased arrays and forgot about orbits
8293,qs2QcycggWU,"And you can transmit data with a traditionnal dish if you have a Block upconverter, like in a VSAT"
8294,qs2QcycggWU,I wouldn't say that's nitpicking- it's just plain wrong and misleading.  After I saw that I stopped watching.
8295,qs2QcycggWU,"Sorry bout that-  Yeah, I was too focused on the phased array part to have the orbits as accurate as possible.  But thanks for the heads up- definitely all future videos will have proper orbits.  I added these facts to the errata."
8296,qs2QcycggWU,@@christalbert722 Sheesh. I hope your joking. The research and effort put into this video is beyond comprehension. How about you put together a video of this caliber without making one mistake.
8297,qs2QcycggWU,"Can't you just say the viewpoint was looking south, not north, so the satellites actually were shown going west to east, @@BranchEducation?"
8298,qs2QcycggWU,"@@nerrad15 I disagree. Accuracy in an educational video is vitally important. For instance, my reaction to seeing fixed dishes presented as communicating with satellites that were clearly non- geostationary caused me to distrust ALL of the information presented in the video, and I stopped watching right there. There are numerous places to learn about Starlink, and I would much prefer to find a source that is trustworthy. Production value is a plus, but accuracy is paramount."
8299,qs2QcycggWU,@@matthewfrost3677I noticed it right from the start. I worked with satellite communications over 30 years including 6 years at a gateway earth station with 15 meter satellite antennas.
8300,qs2QcycggWU,@@ZoulousProductionsThe latency is horrible. I worked with Ethernet on geostationary satellites and the round trip time was over 600 milliseconds.
8301,qs2QcycggWU,@@Chris_at_Home yes it can be up to 1 seconde
8302,qs2QcycggWU,"Always Love your content ❤️, it is very informative like a course. But I have one question, why the speed is not same for sending and receiving data? Also when we make the phase shift for a binary code, is the beam changes its direction because it is told earlier that by phase shifting the signal we can change the direction of the beam."
8303,qs2QcycggWU,"it is explained in the videos that the antennas can either receive or send at any given time, but not simultaneously.
what is not explained (since i imagine it would be intuitive) is that home users in practice use way more download than upload, since you're almost always just consuming content rather than creating. unless you're a content creator uploading your stuff to the internet, 90%+ of your traffic is download.
so most of the time the antennas are spent receiving data and occasionally sending data."
8304,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!!
8305,qs2QcycggWU,@@BattousaiHBr Thanks for helping out!!

8324,qs2QcycggWU,Much Appreciated!
8325,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink is certainly one of the most amazing feats of engineering so far in the 21st century, but I wonder what the life expectancy of this satellites will be with so much space debris in orbit, as well as the ever present risk of a solar flare knocking part the satellite grid down in the future."
8326,qs2QcycggWU,"Starlink's system is quite robust to that.   The low orbit ensures that any defunct satellites will passively deorbit within a few months to years, ensuring no buildup of debris.  This means they require fuel and have a limited lifespan.  Which means they need replacement constantly.  So a flare that knocks out many sattelites just means some additional replacements are necessary. 

It's a system with perpetual, ongoing, active maintenence. So adapting to scenarios that demand additional update or upkeep is fairly simple.

This sort of system relies on cheep launch costs, hence the need for starship to make it sustainable long-term."
8327,qs2QcycggWU,"i believe life expectancy for the sattelites at such a low orbit is about 5 years, since they quickly lose speed/altitude due to friction with the upper atmosphere.
i also believe solar storms aren't of much concern to the satellites due to how small they are compared to the electromagnetic waves of the storm, they affect mostly the electric grid because of how big the conductors (basically the whole grid) are."
8328,qs2QcycggWU,@@Xylos144 this sounds like a hell of environmental pollution just to play fortnite in the desert/woods? and how does this finance itself if most people live in metropolitan areas that have good internet alrdy anyway?
8329,qs2QcycggWU,"couple years. that's been factored in....make no mistake, anything you might think of, they already have and come up with a solution to their satisfaction"
8330,qs2QcycggWU,They also protected be earth fields.... Unlike of big geo sats....
8331,qs2QcycggWU,"The fact that a YouTube channel produces greater content than a big science tv channel while in the same time making it easy to understand blows me always.

hugely underappreciated channel."
8333,qs2QcycggWU,"I greatly appreciate it!  We're slowly building a team... to make it more frequent, but still maintain the depth and quality.  tbh, it's always a little boggling how cursory a 2 hr long science special on 'quantum computers' or 'some other complex topic' is when it's on the TV science channel.  Like I love it- but still it doesn't get into the deep details."
8334,qs2QcycggWU,@@BranchEducation exactly. Someone who see this kind of stuff doesnt want to be just told that the dish uses math to boost the signal. He/she want to learn how .
8335,qs2QcycggWU,"What is this tv you speak of? It has channels? Is it like a serious competitor to YouTube? Sounds like an interesting concept, what's the website address?"

Also, check out the Creator's Comments found in the English (Canada) subtitles for many additional details.  Note: you can access them via the options button -> transcript -> English(Canada).  FAQ: Q1)  Do the two phase shifts from beam steering and 64QAM mess each other up?  A: No.  For transmission, the data is encoded into the 64QAM signal and sent to all the beamformers where then the beam steering phase shift is added.  Then the signal is sent to the front-end modules which increases the power for the patch antennas."

8429,qs2QcycggWU,"Don palsy hits and too soon. In brief, Elon could create a party line in text messages, using the LTC downlink in GPS satellites. Which is decoded and every handset built in the last decade. To create a worldwide party line of text messages that's broadcast. Where the uplink is enter is interception of the cell phone tower transmissions. Which come booming out of their antennas. So loud that they are readable far beyond low earth orbit where the starlinks are. So modify the next generation of starlinks to also listen to those frequencies, and then broadcast down the L2C frequency, using a coding that's not interfering. Granted some will complain but if it's not interfering. Just a slight increase in the noise floor. A basketball team, gribbling and passing the ball until every player has touched the ball at least once. Where the first text sender, is assured delivery everywhere once It sees its message in the L2C it receives. Neither latency or bandwidth guaranteed. Just assurance of delivering. Will support every social network application, as all were born on a text message fabric. And still have that code embedded for legacy support. The handset takes the message, stores it in its internal database. Where unique It passes it on up the text message stack to all users. Where the internal text message database will contain, weeks if not years of from,-tos in relative time order. With payloads in the clear for apps that need to be compatible. With their first instantiations a decade ago. Good news is, delivery is assured to The world's population and their handsets. Bad news, the police and government lose their ability to absolutely censor. Other than perhaps as mandated antivirus filtering services. Use by government to censor, and others to limit children or employees access to things they should not hear or see. The police and governments, need to suck it up, what they lose is more than made up for visibility of all from to in relative time, gumshoe work possible by all. Where privacy as always and discrimination rules have to be enforced by human systems like the courts. Or the family buys the bullets, of those who speak politically incorrectly. The only security at the from to level that exist is operational security. Use it or lose it. One reason For a CEO to step aside. Is he now knows how to compete with himself and As CEO it would be up pure conflict of interest to remain. And any spacefaring nation that has floated their own GPS system can do this, where making the freedom to speak the right to speak, matched with the right to hear. Is utterly destabilizing to dictatorships and autocrats of all kinds, countries and individuals."
8430,qs2QcycggWU,"And for those who would like to disrupt the party line of text messages visible worldwide by jamming those signals. Will disable all use of GPS and its utility. Dave for being an accurate clock. . applications requiring location, if they don't have  built-in inertial navigation system. Will lose any commercial value, and be a  into a safety hazard. Until they pull off to the side of the road and reorient themselves, relative to reading an actual map about the next upcoming turn. The other nice feature about a party line text message service, which some of the existing services already claimed to be. But they forget that a let's connect every but one to everything. Only works if everyone can hear. And only the receiver can choose what to block, or use the equivalent of an antivirus package that they trust to filter what they can hear. Granted many do not use an antivirus folter even turn it off on purpose. Granted, the government could make it illegal to not run the filter they provide."

The thing about remote areas in underdeveloped countries, is that the inhabitants are typically farmers and are very poor.  A family of 2 adults and 3 children will do their best to survive on approximately $10/day.
People in underdeveloped countries like the Philippines, typically live in small huts, approximately 12 sqm, no windows, just curtains hanging to stop the rain, dirt floor, walls made of plywood, roof made of sheets of corrugated metal, structures resembling what people in developed countries would consider a tool shed.
If the inhabitants are lucky they will own a cell phone and a moped which you will see the parents and multiple children traveling together on.
Food for the whole family will be rice three times a day and just a few vegetables and practically no meat.
So I ask you, how are the farmers going to afford an internet service that costs one weeks wages every month for the monthly subscription, plus a down payment for the hardware equivalent to 3 months wages."

The moon is approximately 380000km away from the earth, light travels at about 300000km per second, and an asteroid like that one to be visible from Earth at that distance has to be insanely big, and for what we can see on the video it must at least be traveling at about 1500km per second which is insane, a hit like that would have had a much more catastrophic reaction on the moon.

9679,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it!! 😂
9680,bfThiqDd9FA,Even moon farts sometimes
9681,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how....wait what?
9682,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does it look like a cloud within the atmosphere?
9683,bfThiqDd9FA,"ViralVideoLab ?? I think you still have a lot of work to do on this. But the big problem is that you don't have the skills to improve just a little. Best to let it go, it's not for you. The errors are innumerable. When you get to this point, you have to stop immediately! You should go magnet fishing. You film the depollution and the surprises which will always be present. You will need to be well informed about the dangers. It's still not as simple as you think.  Finding yourself with a finger in the middle of 2 magnets with a potential of 500 KG each is an example. Watch out for each other.
Have a great day and a great future."
9684,bfThiqDd9FA,Kuch bhi
9685,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
9686,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket must be huge and traveling at insane speeds.
9687,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't think we could see anything from the Earth crashing into the Moon without a telescope a high-powered one at best
9688,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that I’m an astronaut and I’m going to meet Olivia Rodrigo and tell her I’m going to explore Uranus.
9689,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's like 500miles of dust in 5secs.

9707,bfThiqDd9FA,C'est un flèque 😂🤣
9708,bfThiqDd9FA,If something crashed into the moon you would even see the object in the first place this has to be a hoax
9709,bfThiqDd9FA,Hit so hard it made the fps drop 😂😅
9710,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is lacking
9711,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahahahah the explosion on the moon has a different framerate than the clouds smoothly going by
9712,bfThiqDd9FA,Only in ohio
9713,bfThiqDd9FA,i love the way how am farting while look at that so called rocket.
9714,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a very insightful comment.
9715,bfThiqDd9FA,",,😂😂😂😂"
9716,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I came across this just to read the comments on what everyone else loves
9717,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is ⅓ the diameter of the moon. Must've been a VIOLENT crash.
9718,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video makes me happier then a queer in a big bag of willies
9719,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my cats breath smells like cat food
9720,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE HOW
9721,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the cloud enlarges in stuttering frames, also, moon dust in space wouldn't show signs of clear up so fast."
9722,bfThiqDd9FA,😅🤣😂
9723,bfThiqDd9FA,That's why the moon has so much crater on it 🌕🤯
9724,bfThiqDd9FA,They just happened to be filming it
9725,bfThiqDd9FA,This is so lame 😂
9726,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone love something on this video

9729,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how toilet paper cleans my butt.
9730,bfThiqDd9FA,"Falso, la relación con la distancia de la luna y la rapidez con la que se propaga la nube de polvo no cuadra, pues no que va el polvo más rápido que el proyectil...😂😂😂😂"
9731,bfThiqDd9FA,The aliens
9732,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon out in the day 🤔🤯
9733,bfThiqDd9FA,07:00

9750,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahahahaha!
9751,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I farted just before the dustcloud appeared
9752,bfThiqDd9FA,There's no atmosphere on the moon. There wouldn't be a mushroom.
9753,bfThiqDd9FA,"What's up with all the, "" I love how's "" ?
I thought for a moment, it was all people from Hawaii commenting ?
                      😳"
9754,bfThiqDd9FA,So interesting how the “cloud” is like 4-8 frames a second yet the video is around 24-30 frames a second  …and I won’t even talk about clouds without air. 😂
9755,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my farts smell.
9756,bfThiqDd9FA,PARECE UMA PIPOCA NÉ 😅😅😅😅

9761,bfThiqDd9FA,Volkswagen acasă 😨😰😊
9762,bfThiqDd9FA,Мне не нравятся фальшивые ролики.
9763,bfThiqDd9FA,I can't believe the video: the dust resulting from the collision rises too fast and does not fall to the surface of the Moon attracted by gravity! 🙄🙄
9764,bfThiqDd9FA,"Если это видео настоящее, то люди верующие в плоскую землю правы..."
9765,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I can be so easily influenced to write an I love how comment
9766,bfThiqDd9FA,cool installation the most interesting thing is the moon in the afternoon
9767,bfThiqDd9FA,"А для чего делать такие фейки, в мире и так много лжи?"

9772,bfThiqDd9FA,that little cloud would have been the size of texas.
9773,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I'm just reading all the comments starting with I love how and I can't seem to stop bc I love how they make me laugh
9774,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try! Mushroom clouds don't form in a vacuum you fool
9775,bfThiqDd9FA,"I hate how unoriginal you all are. Have a genuinely unique thought once in a while. It's brilliant - you'll absolutely love it, I promise."
9776,bfThiqDd9FA,nice cg :D ! well done  but you forgot something ! PHYSICS !

9784,bfThiqDd9FA,Too bad the plume doesn’t come out where the object hits..
9785,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how pancakes taste with butter and syrup.
9786,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is so big and has such high quality
9787,bfThiqDd9FA,That moon high as hell 💨
9788,bfThiqDd9FA,The most dogshit video I ever saw.

9793,bfThiqDd9FA,Brought to us by “ViralVideoLab” 😂😂😂😂
9794,bfThiqDd9FA,crash with 5 fps
9795,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I just wanted to see a rocket Leaving earth In 4k but here I am watching a sus Moon Crash video.
9796,bfThiqDd9FA,What the hell is this ??? What is actually going on anyone ???
9797,bfThiqDd9FA,Because mushroom clouds form from impacts on bodies with no atmosphere 😂
9798,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'm not going to be drinking and driving again!  That really hurt, was so happy the air bags deployed.  Took 3 days for the breakdown vehicle to arrive and took me wreck and me home!"
9799,bfThiqDd9FA,A crash of what ???
9800,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does everyone keep saying “I love”
9801,bfThiqDd9FA,Our Jeep Cherokee's odometer says we've almost made it to the moon!!! Can you make a video of that too?😉
9802,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the one who dominates universe blessing good people and punishing bad people 🎉
9803,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone starts with ”I love how.”
9804,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farted when a butterfly touched it
9805,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon fart😂😂😂😂😂
9806,bfThiqDd9FA,John Koenig landing a Eagle
9807,bfThiqDd9FA,That would be a cloud the size of Washington DC (if not bigger).... 😂
9808,bfThiqDd9FA,Holy 💩 What hit it? 😮 Did we shoot something at it? Probably a nuke if you can see it that well. Glad we’re testing. Holy 💩
9809,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you love me
9810,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how ""lunar farts"" rolls off the tongue"
9811,bfThiqDd9FA,stop doing video on youtube. You suck xD
9812,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
9813,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
9814,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone love's how
9815,bfThiqDd9FA,I love howie mandel on that show...
9816,bfThiqDd9FA,"it's just saitama , got kicked to the moon by boros again"
9817,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video could give its balls a tug.
9818,bfThiqDd9FA,The aliens so advanced they in a different frame rate
9819,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love how there's a mushroom cloud on the moon, an airless object"
9820,bfThiqDd9FA,its because of how the mushroom cloud is at 10fps and the rest of the video is at 30fps :D
9821,bfThiqDd9FA,the fact ppl are so dumb and idi*tic today that they think a normal camera filming from the ground on earth can capture a rocket that is as far away as the moon is really worrying. do you know how far that is??? how dumb are you????? that rocket would have to be the size of a continent to be this visible lmao...
9822,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like Rayleigh-Taylor instability.  An effect you would not see in a vacuum.
9823,bfThiqDd9FA,😳🫨🫣😖…..😝BAAHAHAHAHA🤣🤣😂🤣😇!!!!!!!!!!!
9824,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the way canera captured sound of crash
9825,bfThiqDd9FA,Idiots
9826,bfThiqDd9FA,This is exactly why we will never know the truth anymore. Thirsty idiots looking for likes.
9827,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I love how—"""
9828,bfThiqDd9FA,Will there be any mushroom cloud without any atmosphere?
9829,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how no one else saw this
9830,bfThiqDd9FA,Bra the plane hit the moon
9831,bfThiqDd9FA,Maybe Flat earth could explain this.
9832,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lmaoo true, you need a bunch of liars to explain a lie"
9833,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the unicorn is unfazed.
9834,bfThiqDd9FA,idk 😂😂😂
9835,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how a 20ft long piece of debris was able to produce a mushroom cloud fifteen times larger than that of a 58 megaton thermonuclear bomb.
9836,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
9837,bfThiqDd9FA,I wish I could catch the moon doing suspicious stuff. I once walked out the front door to see a comet looking thing streaking incredibly low like it was headed for our new mall. It looked so odd I had to assess if I was hallucinating. Sarasota is super weird wealthy political town close to a USAF base too tho.🚀😎
9838,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon just farted
9839,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that shiny object at least the size of New York was just free roaming in space close to earth and nobody knew
9840,bfThiqDd9FA,Wait why is the moon in the daylight?
9841,bfThiqDd9FA,"Congratulations, you've made an observation that is made, literally every day."
9842,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it expands as a mushroom cloud despite having no atmosphere.
9843,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how...aaaaaah
9844,bfThiqDd9FA,Why I can't have such ideas from time to time?
9845,bfThiqDd9FA,I do not love how this person tries to deceive people....
9846,bfThiqDd9FA,I think 'love how' should be a new metaphor for acute observation.
9847,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I’m seeing this after beating my meat
9848,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love
9849,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is saying i love how
9850,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this has nothing to do with what I searched
9851,bfThiqDd9FA,What did you search for?
9852,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the volume of dust displaced from the surface of the Moon is about 7 to 10 times the mass of the actual object that impacted, pand is effected like a cloud in earth gravity and atmosphere."
9853,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there was no shock wave
9854,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the guy that made this video has impressed everyone
9855,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the moon never complained, and a dust cloud did earthly things outside its atmosphere"
9856,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how one 43 second video suddenly makes everyone experts in gravity, physics and special effects"
9857,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how people think it takes an advanced degree to understand the basic effects of gravity, physics, and special effects."
9858,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't think you need a degree in astrophysics to understand that dust travelling at a few kilometers per second wouldn't just lose it's velocity and then dissolve in 2 seconds for no reason without atmosphere
9859,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Bogdan_Vader also the framerate of the dust cloud is 10fps... the framerate of the video is 30fps :D
9860,bfThiqDd9FA,some of we might be OGIST alums
9861,bfThiqDd9FA,... and moon phases
9862,bfThiqDd9FA,"No, people just aren't as ignorant as you are."
9863,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how people just say ""I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say I love how people just say"""
9864,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love, how?"
9865,bfThiqDd9FA,Que merda!
9866,bfThiqDd9FA,I regularly take photos of the moon and it never appears this big with tree branches in focus in the foreground.  Funny AI video though.
9867,bfThiqDd9FA,Eyeluv Howe is pissed her ears keep ringing.
9868,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how forever.
9869,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice photo shopping

9875,bfThiqDd9FA,I always make sure to film moon at convenient time
9876,bfThiqDd9FA,😮
9877,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love how you see a poof 💨
9878,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every people type 'i love how' talking about people comenting how and how they love this and how they love that and how they love about the 'how i love'
9879,bfThiqDd9FA,Love that this is the Top Video of my recomended videos.
9880,bfThiqDd9FA,Ma come si puo credere a questo? 😂   Incredibile quanto la stupidità umana sia grande
9881,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the object stutters right before crashing like it was contemplating its actions ""oh no wait! Ah, nevermind"""
9882,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow we can see the moons offspring at a distance
9883,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the moon's fart dude! 🌚💨
9884,bfThiqDd9FA,One of these days Alice!!!!
9885,bfThiqDd9FA,Horse shit
9886,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farts.. 😂
9887,bfThiqDd9FA,I think somebody had to much time on their hands. 😅
9888,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted..?
9889,bfThiqDd9FA,Fajnie zrobione komputerowo 😅
9890,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn’t know that moon can fart😮
9891,bfThiqDd9FA,"In 380.000 km Entfernung so ein - im Verhältnis zur Mondgröße - winziges Raketenteil so gut sichtbar zu machen - wie geht das?
Unglaublich, dass die Staubwolke des Einschlags nach 1 Sekunde schon 200 km hoch ist ... Atombomben gehen anders hoch ..."
9892,bfThiqDd9FA,it gained a little chef hat
9893,bfThiqDd9FA,that's just saitama
9894,bfThiqDd9FA,"this is stolen but no one commented on the original soooo..







I love how all the comment starts with ""I love how"""
9895,bfThiqDd9FA,Какой бред
9896,bfThiqDd9FA,This would be devastating to life on moon if there were life on moon
9897,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like these comments are bots most of them anyway
9898,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how 😂
9899,bfThiqDd9FA,This needs more quality and to be a little more realistic. The video editor need to know physics.
9900,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I’m just seeing this now
9901,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how i stopped reading the full comment each time and just started speed scrolling to make sure each one started with, “I love how”."
9902,bfThiqDd9FA,😮buggin noticing the same..
9903,bfThiqDd9FA,"Crazy, like A.I. wrote them."
9904,bfThiqDd9FA,So the moon is really a cloud ☁️ maker.  I had my suspicions but now it’s confirmed.   Thanks 👍 ✅ YouBoob.
9905,bfThiqDd9FA,"that was some epic fart... not star dust, but moon dust, so still something."
9906,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon,,!! Did you just fart*???? 🌝🌝"
9907,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the satelite hit the moon so hard the dust cloud was lagging the universe
9908,bfThiqDd9FA,"only the dust cloud lagged.... at exactly 10fps, while the rest of the video continued at 30fps"
9909,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can almost hear the sound of the impact and the dispersion of the blast and the birds don’t even care.
9910,bfThiqDd9FA,This is lit
9911,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how stupid this is
9912,bfThiqDd9FA,Why I did not hear the explosion?
9913,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love How. 

He's a great guy."
9914,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the projectile is quite literally 90° from the perspective of the cameraman
9915,bfThiqDd9FA,Hollywood 👏🏻🤣🍿😳
9916,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how cats meow.
9917,bfThiqDd9FA,Stupid
9918,bfThiqDd9FA,Guys if a fucking nuke blew up on moon then it wouldn't be visible from earth by eye
9919,bfThiqDd9FA,Sun & moon within the firmament
9920,bfThiqDd9FA,This is obviously kerbal space program
9921,bfThiqDd9FA,like😮
9922,bfThiqDd9FA,"For a start, the explosion is as jerky as Jason and the Argonauts."
9923,bfThiqDd9FA,"For a start, the explosion is as jerky as Jason and the Argonauts."
9924,bfThiqDd9FA,Das  ist  nicht echt. 😮
9925,bfThiqDd9FA,0kr
9926,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
9927,bfThiqDd9FA,"А ктото поверит ведь, и будет думать что это правда"
9928,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😂🤣😂😆
9929,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video was recommended to me literally right after watching Moonfall. 😂
9930,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how th
9931,bfThiqDd9FA,"Video falsi con tante Visualizzazioni,  ecco cosa vi piace essere presi per i fondelli 😂"
9932,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how cocaine is a hell of a drug
9933,bfThiqDd9FA,Montaj
9934,bfThiqDd9FA,Ty moon for stepping up
9935,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the impact happens at the exact visual perimeter of the moon, so as to maximize drama in spontaneous video footage."
9936,bfThiqDd9FA,Why editor not removed the tree??😁
9937,bfThiqDd9FA,The camera needs more wiggle effect
9938,bfThiqDd9FA,
9939,bfThiqDd9FA,😔🌑
9940,bfThiqDd9FA,Akunamanatatta.
9941,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyday i can breath
9942,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every comment starts with i love how
9943,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you said that.
9944,bfThiqDd9FA,"And here is the Moon with another major win and save. That shit would have decimated Earth if the Moon hadn't been in that exact position at that precise moment. It looked big enough to have wiped out Texas completely. The Earth's Moon is much more than we realize it is though. It's our protector that recieves nor expects any thanks or praise. I want to hear what that sounded like when it struck. Like, did it ring like it did when they dropped their boosters off on its surface when they were jumping back off and coming back home?"
9945,bfThiqDd9FA,“I thought it was farther away I swear!! That thing is deceptively small!”
9946,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow that seed became a tree really fast. They must have used bonemeal. I’m glad they didn’t leave any floating trees though.
9947,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I'm always late to the party
9948,bfThiqDd9FA,Very polite of the moon to grow 10x bigger than normal for this 8 frames per second collision
9949,bfThiqDd9FA,AI again…. Boring!
9950,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everybody's comment starts with an ""I love how"""
9951,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love how the Moon is gigantic, like the moons in The Elder Scrolls games"
9952,bfThiqDd9FA,I think is Santana
9953,bfThiqDd9FA,"What a coincidence you were filming the moon, just seconds before that extremely rare impact. 👌😎"
9954,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the Mariachi singer hits the high note just as the rocket crashes on the Moon (you will need headphones to hear it).
9955,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all of you love how...
9956,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I seen this two years later but never made the news
9957,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people love how
9958,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you said that
9959,bfThiqDd9FA,"Pathetic attempt by someone who has no clue as to how basic physics works, the cloud would not have dissipated."
9960,bfThiqDd9FA,How
9961,bfThiqDd9FA,"I already know some kids looking up at the sky and saying ""mom the moon farted"""
9962,bfThiqDd9FA,Jeeze🤡
9963,bfThiqDd9FA,"I just love, gotta have love for someone who puts so much time and effort into creating something that can get 11 miliion views in 2 years, but which is 45 seconds of nothing at all. Why did this come up in mu feed anyway, I was looking for radio controlled yachts??"
9964,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they knew that was going to happen. And was ready for it years in advance .
9965,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I still dont believe we went to the moon....or this video...or Kamala Harris is not a hyena...
9966,bfThiqDd9FA,Bello però!
9967,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how crazy fleas on the moon are called lunar ticks.
9968,bfThiqDd9FA,So much love for the loving how.
9969,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how flat earthers are hyped about this clip
9970,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the sound of birds chirping, except in the morning when they wake me up."
9971,bfThiqDd9FA,N'importe quoi
9972,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds just happen to be tweeting during a moon crash
9973,bfThiqDd9FA,I love who loves AI
9974,bfThiqDd9FA,ET go home 👉
9975,bfThiqDd9FA,Facepalm
9976,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember watching this live. Was amazing
9977,bfThiqDd9FA,chill bois moon is just taking a smoke nothing special its not like NASA is planning a moon attack
9978,bfThiqDd9FA,Love it 😊
9979,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in the comments are on the same page.
9980,bfThiqDd9FA,Wait that was an actual event
9981,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow. How'd they know it was gonna happen and what was it.  🤔
9982,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I'm about two years late for this party
9983,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how
9984,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all united around all the things we love.
9985,bfThiqDd9FA,Who saw a nuclear explosion on the moon not me!
9986,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this comment feed isn't bright enough to understand sarcasm
9987,bfThiqDd9FA,What does that mean?
9988,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@Yashraj100xI love how you don't know they mean...
9989,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how chicha bow wow
9990,bfThiqDd9FA,"Think about it. The moon is nearly a quarter the size of the Earth and look how big it is from 250,000 miles from earth. Space junk would be no bigger than a rocket booster, which you would never be able to see from Earth even if you had a large telescope."
9991,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s amazing that whatever “hits” the moon appears to be small and in our atmosphere.  And the cloud looks ridiculous.
9992,bfThiqDd9FA,Finally someone's recorded where my drone landed well am not getting that back 😒
9993,bfThiqDd9FA,It must be true it’s on YouTube.
9994,bfThiqDd9FA,Just on the perimeter of the lunar circle ! 😂
9995,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves how.
9996,bfThiqDd9FA,I love down-voting conspiracy videos

9998,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I hate this video..  total BS..
9999,bfThiqDd9FA,Find better things to do with your time.
10000,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon loves how we love watching it😮
10001,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf 😆  the cloud conpair to moon size and distance from earth 😂 also in zero gravity no atmosphere the ejected material would go in a straight line in all directions from the impact point zero chance of a mushroom cloud ☁️ 😂😂
10002,bfThiqDd9FA,"pro tip: next time simulating smoke, turn off atmosphere."
10003,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE REALITY 💙🩵💙😉😉
10004,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon isn't even that big 💀
10005,bfThiqDd9FA,Это зарадилось облако или видеомонтаж
10006,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats because its AI
10007,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love how birds are chirping in the background
10008,bfThiqDd9FA,Iks kurwa deeee
10009,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is loving how.
10010,bfThiqDd9FA,March 4 is wery very close at my birthday

10015,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how












sorry,i got nothing"

10017,bfThiqDd9FA,I love hoe
10018,bfThiqDd9FA,How came we don't hear an explosion?
10019,bfThiqDd9FA,くっだらね〜
10020,bfThiqDd9FA,The way the dust blows around really shows how dense the air is up there
10021,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love 


😅"
10022,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah right 😅😂😂
10023,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my hands feel when I rub them in my hair
10024,bfThiqDd9FA,"I mean, could be done better, starting with matching the fps. I recommend watching Corridor Digital videos!"
10025,bfThiqDd9FA,Diganle al que edito ese video que no existe atmosfera en la luna así hace otro un poco más realista...
10026,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Jesus Christ.
10027,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
10028,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10029,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you pinned the Comment of Shame.
10030,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate the way the moon got in the way
10031,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon sneezed.
10032,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how NASA tries to keep NASAing us into NASAing NASAness NASA
10033,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how to spell i love how
10034,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how…
10035,bfThiqDd9FA,I love pure whiteness of the moon-cloud + birds song in the background
10036,bfThiqDd9FA,well if its space wouldnt that mean the dust cloud and debris would literally start orbiting the moon rather than disappearing into thin air...well if there was any air
10037,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, this, obviously titanic, object - travelling at about 20% of the speed of light is supposed to crash into the Moon?"
10038,bfThiqDd9FA,Hologram  it that s all
10039,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the cloud convects into a mushroom, as if in 'moon air'."
10040,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I've just found this video
10041,bfThiqDd9FA,"I just love ""HOW"""
10042,bfThiqDd9FA,How how holy cow
10043,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
10044,bfThiqDd9FA,Nope
10045,bfThiqDd9FA,That was me paying baseball when it was my turn to bat. I scored a homerun that day.
10046,bfThiqDd9FA,"You didn't say ""I love how"" you were playing baseball at that moment... 😂"
10047,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the way you(editor) lie 😂😂
10048,bfThiqDd9FA,kids these days.
10049,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everbody likes my comment because they love how everybody writing love how in comments and i also love how i spent more than hour reading comment section of video which is less than 1 minute because i love how everybody say love how in comment section because they love how everybody saying love how and they copy that because they love how
10050,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how poop stain jokes make me laugh.
10051,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted...
10052,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is in a loving mood
10053,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon may have a baby soon
10054,bfThiqDd9FA,Ha-ha
10055,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it didn't effect the Earth's gravitational pull
10056,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how of everyone got the memo to start their comments with I love how
10057,bfThiqDd9FA,I literally rolled my eyes
10058,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty good!
10059,bfThiqDd9FA,It is an angel.
10060,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how my toes form a ramp, but then my toe doesn’t attend the function"
10061,bfThiqDd9FA,"given what i saw that ""rocket"" must have been like 50 miles wide and 150 miles long. The moon also appears to have 500 miles of some kind of atmosphere. which is impressive given the Earth's pretty much only goes about 60 miles. And lets not even get into the insane speeds everything was going..."
10062,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how i just purposely poop my pants.
10063,bfThiqDd9FA,"A dust cloud in outer space.... riiigghht, that is visible from earth... suurre, (eye roll, head shake)"
10064,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how titties bounce❤
10065,bfThiqDd9FA,The cloud disappears in 10 seconds. So faked.
10066,bfThiqDd9FA,كذب القمر خارج الغلاف الجوي فكيف يكون ذلك انفجار
10067,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is complete bullshit. The rocket must be the size of Florida and the mushroom cloud is comical.😂
10068,bfThiqDd9FA,real or fake
10069,bfThiqDd9FA,Everybody spreading loooveee ❤😂
10070,bfThiqDd9FA,I love woman with curvy shapes and large breasts … 😂

10073,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
10074,bfThiqDd9FA,Nau😢
10075,bfThiqDd9FA,This isn’t even close to being legitimate
10076,bfThiqDd9FA,Poor Wiley E. Coyote crashed on the moon. 😂
10077,bfThiqDd9FA,An impact on an airless body would not make a mushroom cloud. The ejecta would fan out radially on ballistic trajectories.
10078,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts with......""I love how"". :)"
10079,bfThiqDd9FA,I love I hate fukkkkku guys
10080,bfThiqDd9FA,Harsh bro
10081,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he knew about the happening incident earlier ❤
10082,bfThiqDd9FA,"From different location, hahaha 😆"
10083,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all wasted 43 sec life for this!
10084,bfThiqDd9FA,Луна курить😂😂😂
10085,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I’ve never seen this bit of crap before. 😂
10086,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is as reflective of the sun as the surface of the moon.
10087,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how i hate reading the comments and wasting my time😂
10088,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love how the moon gets to have its own adventures way over there in that part of the sky.
10089,bfThiqDd9FA,"How the love I is what is love
baby don't hurt me
don't hurt me
No more"
10090,bfThiqDd9FA,Uma nuvem de poeira não sobe tão rápido como foi demonstrada
10091,bfThiqDd9FA,Fake bird chirping on background

10097,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how...
10098,bfThiqDd9FA,I love...when I come to the comments and get a good chuckle.
10099,bfThiqDd9FA,"Very cool.  No mushroom clouds possible on the moon, tho.  Would love to see one where the impact ‘ejecta’ gets blown out in a cone shape!"
10100,bfThiqDd9FA,There's a f****ng add for another video that doesn't let me finish watching before it shows up. F****ng bs
10101,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how these are the funniest comments I have ever read on YouTube.!!!!   No lie!
10102,bfThiqDd9FA,scam XD
10103,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this real or video editing?
10104,bfThiqDd9FA,Mr. How is successful
10105,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is finding out about Ricroks Tattoos
10106,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we will continue to love how it loves how it loves how we love how
10107,bfThiqDd9FA,"Whoever made that got the scale all wrong, you made the moon look like it is only about 1km in diameter, should have had dust mushroom cloud 10x slower....try again"
10108,bfThiqDd9FA,They only have 15 fps on the moon
10109,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how i look in the mirror
10110,bfThiqDd9FA,Just a 💨
10111,bfThiqDd9FA,how did he know there would be a cloud of dust

10116,bfThiqDd9FA,PMSL🤣🤣🤣
10117,bfThiqDd9FA,What is that?
10118,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is everyone saying “I Love How?? Only 50 trillion people say that in the comments here. What is that? It very annoying.
10119,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you picked up on that
10120,bfThiqDd9FA,Ay'ı Ruslar'dan önce vurmak için holivud tarafından yapılmış sahte bir video olduğunu düşünüyorum
10121,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we can see this from earth
10122,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love How,
Or as they say in S Korea
어떻게"
10123,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I never knew about this 7/5/24
10124,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems like moon is out of air
10125,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video ended up in my feed

10128,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the man on the moon blowing smoke 😂out his ear hole!
10129,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farted dust.
10130,bfThiqDd9FA,moon farts 😂

10133,bfThiqDd9FA,До чего идиотские комментарии .
10134,bfThiqDd9FA,Well done! Now you have learnt how to use AI video generation.
10135,bfThiqDd9FA,So much bs.. the smoke impact is like a quarter size of the moon? Where u can see like so darn far away 😂🤦🏻 what a joke.. its like in a walt disney cartoon
10136,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how cucumbers taste better pickled 🎉
10137,bfThiqDd9FA,Artemis landed on the moon 'The eagle sat down'
10138,bfThiqDd9FA,so the moon fart

10148,bfThiqDd9FA,"I seriously doubt a 100 megaton nuclear device could cause even a modicum of disturbance this ""rocket"" appears to have caused."
10149,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how unreal this is 😂
10150,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is obviously crap if anyone is wondering . think about it . if that is a rocked it would have to be massive  the size of a big city . there is no way you could see a rocket with the naked eye from that distance . think how small a passenger jet looks and its only a few miles above the ground
10151,bfThiqDd9FA,What hits the moon? Is it a meteor?🤔 that look like a atomic explosion.😮 from far far distance .
10152,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the sound of those love birds in the soundtrack.
10153,bfThiqDd9FA,I call BullShit
10154,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that mushroom cloud made me fart!

10334,bfThiqDd9FA,"The three-tonne rocket part had been tracked for a number of years, but its origin was contested.

At first, astronomers thought it might have belonged to Elon Musk's SpaceX firm, and then said it was Chinese - something China denies.

The effects of the impact on the Moon should have been minor.

The rocket stage would have dug out a small crater and created a plume of dust.

Scientists hope to get confirmation in the coming days, or weeks.

The rocket part was first sighted from Earth in March 2015. A Nasa-funded space survey in Arizona spotted it, but quickly lost interest when the object was shown not to be an asteroid.

The rocket part is what's known as ""space junk"" - hardware discarded from missions or satellites without enough fuel or energy to return to Earth.

Some pieces are closer to us, just above the Earth, but others, like this booster, are thousands of kilometres away in high orbit, far from the Earth's atmosphere.

The European Space Agency estimates there are now 36,500 pieces of space junk larger than 10cm.

No space programme or university formally tracks deep space junk. Monitoring space is expensive and the risks to humans from high-orbit debris are low.

So, it falls to a tiny handful of volunteer astronomers who spend their free time making calculations and estimating orbits. They fire emails and alerts back and forth, asking whoever is in the best location on the planet to spot an object in space.

Six weeks after the booster was first seen, Peter Birtwhistle, 63, was watching the skies for asteroids from his garden in Newbury, in the south of England.

His telescope picked up a tiny dot of light tracking across the sky. Calculations suggested it was part of a rocket, he told BBC News.

Space junk drops in and out of view, often unpredictably. For seven years, he barely saw the rocket part - until in January, it reappeared.

""I grabbed some images when it passed close to Earth,"" he explained.

He sent his pictures to astronomer and data scientist Bill Gray, on the east coast of the United States. He is the expert who went on to identify it as a SpaceX booster heading for the Moon.

News that a discarded part of one of billionaire Musk's space missions was going to strike the Moon made global headlines.

But tracking space junk is often ""detective work,"" Gray explains. The rocket insignia cannot be seen - astronomers have to piece together its identity by tracking its route backwards through space. They then match its orbit to dates and locations of rocket launches and trajectories.

But some space missions, including China's, don't publicise their routes.

""For a Chinese mission, we know the launch date because they are televised. So I take a guess that it's going to get to the Moon - usually in four or five days. Then I compute an approximate orbit,"" Gray explains.

And sometimes he makes mistakes. Weeks after the SpaceX identification, another observer sent Gray new data, revealing that his identification was impossible.

He ran the numbers again and concluded it was the third stage of a rocket from China's lunar mission Chang'e 5-T1, launched in October 2014.

China denied this, saying the upper-stage had re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up.

Gray is sticking to his prediction. He believes China has mixed up the tracking of two rocket parts. ""I'm 99.9% sure it's the China 5-T1,"" he says.

In reality, we will never be sure.

Prof Hugh Lewis, from University of Southampton, says the scientific value of tracking deep space junk is limited. But he says it's important to ""keep an eye on what's there"", especially as human settlement in space becomes more likely.

""It's the mess we've created. Objects that we think are safe can actually return to Earth unexpectedly,"" he says.

Wherever it came from, no-one will have witnessed the booster's last moments.

Evidence of what happened won't come until two satellites that orbit the Moon pass over the projected impact site and photograph the resulting crater feature.

And as the booster broke into thousands of pieces, much of the physical evidence of its true origins will be lost, too. The best we've got are the estimates made by Gray and the volunteer astronomers watching the skies.

10335,bfThiqDd9FA,If you zoom in you can see the added image as it pixels out.  Nice try.
10336,bfThiqDd9FA,Now I know how clouds are made the moon is just farting

10351,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how our perspective sight line is at a perfect right angle to the impact plume so that we could see its profile. I also like how a 400 mile high plume is formed from a collision with no visible impact flash. I really, really like how the moon now has an invisible but extremely thick atmosphere."

10357,bfThiqDd9FA,"Anyone smart enough to wipe their own ass knows that without an atmosphere, even with a 10 kiloton nuke, the explosion wouldn't have been so acute.

10386,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice sync with the camera shake, but not good sync with camera frame rate.  If you want it to sync to be more believable, interpolate enough frames on the explosion to match the camera's frame rate.  Not a terrible effort."
10387,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all just saw the moon fart.
10388,bfThiqDd9FA,I pray for the moons inhabitants.
10389,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦🏼‍♀️ You should be banned from YouTube 🤦🏼‍♀️

10400,bfThiqDd9FA,This video would have been cool in 1990! ...Maybe!!
10401,bfThiqDd9FA,"Fun fact: the reason that the moon has a lot of holes, its because astroids hit the moon a lot. And the moon has no protection like earth. When a astroid hits the moon,the hole is red. After a bit it becomes dry grey like the other holes, thats why it has a lot of holes."
10402,bfThiqDd9FA,Anjo entrou na lua

10407,bfThiqDd9FA,did the moon just fart?
10408,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😅😅😅

10415,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how may laxative worked this morning.

10440,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is so sarcastic!
10441,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
10442,bfThiqDd9FA,"If this was UFO footage, the quality of the picture would be Nokia 3210"
10443,bfThiqDd9FA,"Pretty sure a inpact cloud on a body without atmosphere would not be a mushroom cloud.
:D"
10444,bfThiqDd9FA,But he sure got us to watch it 🎉

10462,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the sound of breaking glass
10463,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon finally got atmosphere.
10464,bfThiqDd9FA,"A 10 to 20 mile wide ""rocket part"" creates  an 800 mile wide cloud and then it just disperses in airless space in a few seconds."
10465,bfThiqDd9FA,uma colisão em solo lunar não causaria um cogumelo considerando que a lua não possui atmosfera.
10466,bfThiqDd9FA,Junk has slammed into the moon alright. Fabricated video junk.
10467,bfThiqDd9FA,Load o bollocks.

10490,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah yes, another channel to be shut down!"

10508,bfThiqDd9FA,crazy
10509,bfThiqDd9FA,BS...  the object would have to be the size of Texas to be seen with just a camera and then it couldn't be moving at the speed that object was.  This is allowed by YouTube but many factual things are not.
10510,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice try, way off"
10511,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon Fart !!..😅
10512,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a Chinese stupid rocket who is colide to moon 🌝😂

10523,bfThiqDd9FA,Who thinks this is cap
10524,bfThiqDd9FA,Оператор всегда точно знает когда снимать
10525,bfThiqDd9FA,"This looks like the government trying to throw a rocket at the firmament. It's on NASA's own website that they anticipated this, only they called it a ""rogue rocket for experimental purposes"". That's how people knew to watch and record."
10526,bfThiqDd9FA,FAF
10527,bfThiqDd9FA,Mmm.. yeah sure
10528,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love everything that I love with how I love something that is crazy and how I love it
10529,bfThiqDd9FA,Stupid
10530,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how I just found this video and clicked on it because it is  only 45 seconds long and not a pod cast about another pod cast using clips from the news and the host stopping the clip every 10 seconds to add their 2cents and then back to the first podcast host who does the same thing so it takes 45 minutes to watch a 45 second news clip.❤
Strange days we are living in."
10531,bfThiqDd9FA,You lost me at the “not a pod cast about another pod cast”
10532,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
10533,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow the whole world did not see this and yet you did. Which planet do you live in?
10534,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love listening to y’all bitch at each other over a video made in an obvious attempt to get you to do just that, bitch at each other…"
10535,bfThiqDd9FA,This is why I love the internet 😂

10538,bfThiqDd9FA,Как будто луна пукнула😂
10539,bfThiqDd9FA,This is how the dinosaurs became extinct on Earth. Glad it happened on the moon instead.
10540,bfThiqDd9FA,"If it's true, it's really poorly made.."

Been doing similar things lately to test out effects."
10544,bfThiqDd9FA,YouTube comments make me wanna kill myself.  It's terrible how we treat our brothers and sisters; it's gross how smart we think we are.
10545,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
10546,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my mum
10547,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahhaa.

10550,bfThiqDd9FA,xD
10551,bfThiqDd9FA,🙏🏾🪨 that cloud ☁️  made a hart 🤍 0:31
10552,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm so glad someone noticed this 😍
10553,bfThiqDd9FA,@Allaboard139ers  yes 🙏🏾✝️🪨 it was right there.
10554,bfThiqDd9FA,To see an explosion like that from earth the rocket had to be equipped by an atom bomb
10555,bfThiqDd9FA,How moon fart is
10556,bfThiqDd9FA,the mushroom cloud alone lets us know that wasn't no damn rocket piece that slammed into the moon that was a spaceship of some sort
10557,bfThiqDd9FA,As true as the rocket in the eye of the moon by georges meliès.
10558,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the people saying i love how

10564,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the clouds taste
10565,bfThiqDd9FA,i love the moon that is so so close to earth hahahahaha
10566,bfThiqDd9FA,That is local ; NOT millions of miles out.
10567,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I don't love it
10568,bfThiqDd9FA,Wile E. Coyote still not catching Road Runner.
10569,bfThiqDd9FA,I’m surprised humanity hasn’t witnessed something like this happening to the moon yet. PS someone did record what look like immediate glancing across the surface of the moon once
10570,bfThiqDd9FA,"didn't know fps drops on the moon, very cool"
10571,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how this video helps people express how to love
10572,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people write such insane comments
10573,bfThiqDd9FA,"The Moon is Getting Closer about 150,000 km"
10574,bfThiqDd9FA,That thing travelled 5 times the diameter of moon in 16sec..😮
10575,bfThiqDd9FA,"Это будет гораздо медленнее учитывая расстояние и размер луны, при ударе выделиться свет очень яркий"
10576,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how retarded i feel myself about losing 45 sec of my life , watching this bs."
10577,bfThiqDd9FA,I love myself
10578,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s one HUGE ASS rocket part.
10579,bfThiqDd9FA,Fard
10580,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon just farted😂
10581,bfThiqDd9FA,Vê claramente que é montagem
10582,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice effects, wich one software used?"

10588,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how… wait there so many other comments like this
10589,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Youtube Recommendations are an absolute bag of festering shit and this entire site is run by fucking morons :L
10590,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10591,bfThiqDd9FA,There is something wrong here. As far as thay tell us the moon Is not that I believe them. But if the moon is the distance thay say it is then do you understand how big that plasma plum would be. You can't believe anything ever. Or at least don't believe in things that affect your or anyone else's life it's. Fine to have a belief that you may win the lottery one day and as long as it doesn't affect your life and others. But to believe someone can be possessed by devils or demonds is not a healthy or safe belief as it has and still is being seen yep
10592,bfThiqDd9FA,You made money of this video at least.
10593,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how clear the moon was visible on that sunny DAY!
10594,bfThiqDd9FA,It happens all the time. Go outside.
10595,bfThiqDd9FA,It can be late at night in Norway in the summer :-)
10596,bfThiqDd9FA,Oogabooga
10597,bfThiqDd9FA,I like the bird chirping in the background .
10598,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people don't understand that it is just a fart of moon.
10599,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that such massive object doesn't break the moon in several fragments or change its orbit.
10600,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how your avatar looks
10601,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket is 100km wide.
10602,bfThiqDd9FA,Sigh... Chuck Norris is playing golf again. The US gov still hasn't mustered up the courage to tell him to knock it off.
10603,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how there's not a peep from the camera man as if these things just ""happen""."
10604,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Howie
10605,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing what we can do with our spare time these days.

10610,bfThiqDd9FA,Seriously you need a life
10611,bfThiqDd9FA,I expected it will pop!
10612,bfThiqDd9FA,After watching this if you still think the moon is a rock that we landed on....I have a bridge to sell you.
10613,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try w/ the cash heart where the send arrow usually is...tsk tsk
10614,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's soooo cute, baby got an I phone..."
10615,bfThiqDd9FA,Satama hả
10616,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how people pretend to love how something stupid happened.
10617,bfThiqDd9FA,the man in the moon was having a puff
10618,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the astronauts get pissed when asked of they actually went to space
10619,bfThiqDd9FA,"And you just ready with your cam to shot  this moment. I believe, yeah I believe ..."
10620,bfThiqDd9FA,What the heck is that
10621,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people oil up infront of me.
10622,bfThiqDd9FA,i like How the Entire Description of This Video looks like the Kind of illogical Crap Ai Generates.
10623,bfThiqDd9FA,FLIRT
10624,bfThiqDd9FA,i didn't know the gravity on the moon was so low that the explosion flies to space
10625,bfThiqDd9FA,moon said 💨
10626,bfThiqDd9FA,😮😅😢❤😂
10627,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cats..

10631,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Kel loves orange soda.
10632,bfThiqDd9FA,You just happens to be filming the moon during the day 🤦🏼
10633,bfThiqDd9FA,Луна пёрнула😂
10634,bfThiqDd9FA,Почему облака от падения не известного объекта на луну пошло только на высоту а не по кругу
10635,bfThiqDd9FA,"It must be a rocket much, much larger than Saturn V to see it so clearly from Earth. Also, a mushroom-shaped explosion in space? What a load of utter rubbish. Sadly, the world is full of fakers!"
10636,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people born in the 1920s live longer than people born in the 90s maybe because they didnt believe ignorance such as this.
10637,bfThiqDd9FA,Fart
10638,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how almost everyone begin their comment with the 1st 3 words of this comment
10639,bfThiqDd9FA,ficou massa heim rsrsrsr
10640,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you even realize how big that dust cloud would have to be to be seen from earth?
10641,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm just trying to find videos on kuhli loaches
10642,bfThiqDd9FA,another crap video ...
10643,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
10644,bfThiqDd9FA,CAP

Zavolejte někomu!!! 😂😂😂😅🎉"
10647,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10648,bfThiqDd9FA,More likely I like how the explosion was on like 7fps. I think the clouds there behave differently
10649,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the meteor was moving with at least 1% speed of light and not create any tail or burnout
10650,bfThiqDd9FA,He needs a better editor 😂
10651,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely done but the difference in framerates between the video and the crash dust cloud gave it away.
10652,bfThiqDd9FA,Its judt the camera guys girlfriend vaping🤣🤣🤣
10653,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody just love how🤣🤣
10654,bfThiqDd9FA,it looks like the moon farted
10655,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it feels when I take a fat dump at home after being at work all day.
10656,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you love
10657,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the moon takes it, like a dad's just patted a bag of cement..."
10658,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people waste valuable time insulting our intelligence
10659,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I have nothing new or interesting to add.
10660,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that it says it's a rocket part but it's probably the size of a small island.
10661,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the birds in the background
10662,bfThiqDd9FA,😨
10663,bfThiqDd9FA,Well it made us watch it. Very convincing but any impact from whatever wouldn't create a dust cloud as large as this one and especially in a couple of seconds.
10664,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he knew to watch the moon AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY!🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♀️
10665,bfThiqDd9FA,After Effect-Andy fly again!
10666,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lmao.

The ""crash"" has a different framerate to the rest of the video."
10667,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it’s 2AM and this is what YouTube recommends
10668,bfThiqDd9FA,yo wtf its 2:09 am rn for me
10669,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it's 201 here
10670,bfThiqDd9FA,1:45 AM
10671,bfThiqDd9FA,Yooo 2:14 wtf
10672,bfThiqDd9FA,"I was looking up blue holes and YouTube thought I ""might also like this"" 🙄"
10673,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farts
10674,bfThiqDd9FA,Berapa lama anda mengedit ini?
10675,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how its 2 yrs. Later and people from all over are sharing ""a moment "" in our lives - sharing our i love how - humorous sentences ❤"
10676,bfThiqDd9FA,NOOOOOOOOOOO
10677,bfThiqDd9FA,"If rockets were really as huge and powerful as this, I'd be terrified for our world!"
10678,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate!👹
10679,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the impact creates a mushroom cloud on the moon even though it has no atmosphere
10680,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the camera man already knew what was going to happen so he focused on that angle to get a better footage for us
10681,bfThiqDd9FA,I like to fart when I take a piss.
10682,bfThiqDd9FA,"Это явный монтаж. Во-первых в безотмасферное среде такое облако пыл не может сформировться, во-вторых скорость его образования физически нереальная. За 3 секунда гриб в 1000 км? Серьезно?! Ну и в-третьих - анимация рваная =)"
10683,bfThiqDd9FA,Love is in the air
10684,bfThiqDd9FA,i love the monkey head
10685,bfThiqDd9FA,Voyager 1 came back?🤣
10686,bfThiqDd9FA,Thank goodness it didn't hot waste disposal area 2!
10687,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is so big😢 i see it small
10688,bfThiqDd9FA,"i like how this person's camera is pointing at the moon during the day at this very moment to catch this, because this is what people do."
10689,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, right, sure uh-huh."
10690,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all came to the comments section
10691,bfThiqDd9FA,No chime😆 bell 😆dong😆 bong😂 a simple ding😆a tweet a bird contrails vapor stay longer heck baby power fots stay visual more 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10692,bfThiqDd9FA,Idiots
10693,bfThiqDd9FA,Look small but its big and bery quick😊
10694,bfThiqDd9FA,I appreciate how the dust cloud disappears in exactly 13 easily distinguishable frames
10695,bfThiqDd9FA,Well made crash. Looks like a cartoon explosion
10696,bfThiqDd9FA,the object passed below the clouds...interesting
10697,bfThiqDd9FA,2fps
10698,bfThiqDd9FA,"The only thing that crashed was your renderer, man!"
10699,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there are people dumb enough to believe this
10700,bfThiqDd9FA,Then i just i survived of moon crash.
10701,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how.. just because it's how I love how
10702,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
10703,bfThiqDd9FA,"Keep vaping dude, the impact was so small it would not appear on earth. It was to see if the cloud had water."
10704,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the “rocket” just appears in the screen and doesn’t fly INTO the screen from the edge. 😂
10705,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I have depression
10706,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves not knowing they’re loving the love before them but after the first only to have begun by the initial love without knowing all it took was love
10707,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how-ling at that thing.
10708,bfThiqDd9FA,"Obviously a bird strike caused a lunar gps satellite to crash. It's only visible because it was burning up in the moon's atmosphere. The ""dust plume"" is probably snow."
10709,bfThiqDd9FA,That was my drone
10710,bfThiqDd9FA,The most amazing video of the century!!! - not. I love how my comment is bonkers 🤭🤭😂
10711,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the moon but I don't love ultra speed of light dust
10712,bfThiqDd9FA,Its saitama 😂😂
10713,bfThiqDd9FA,dust is spreading much too fast
10714,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how YouTube algorithms work[!]
10715,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is true, I was over the moon and I felt the impact 😂"
10716,bfThiqDd9FA,2024😂
10717,bfThiqDd9FA,I love people loving stuff about this lovely video
10718,bfThiqDd9FA,That should have happen 2weeks ago when there was 3moons in the sky at the same time when solar eclips happend.
10719,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems like everyone “loves how”
10720,bfThiqDd9FA,"Adoro como vocês americanos repetem adoro, mesmo não adorando porra nenhuma."
10721,bfThiqDd9FA,"love how the dust cloud swirls as if there is thick atmosphere on the moon. Not to mention the size of the ""space junk"" would have been the size of a large city."
10722,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how. How loves me too.
10723,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is 4 times smaller than that 😂 But great job!
10724,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how.
10725,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I never heard about this two years ago. You would think it would have been a big deal.🤷🏻
10726,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh please. You had better reconsider the actual scale of the moon. 

Also, there is no way you'd see a small object in the daylight like that. That reflection brightness was more like looking at the ISS at night."
10727,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the most comments start with “I love”
10728,bfThiqDd9FA,Are you able to see the crater from space?
10729,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how a ""rocket part"" just created an explosion larger than all the worlds entire nuclear arsenal put together."
10730,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I was taught
10731,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love how i made it here, now"
10732,bfThiqDd9FA,the human race is the most ignorant and gullible of all the species in the universe
10733,bfThiqDd9FA,"Some of the bigger craters, just one crater, now, not the entire block on the moon, but 1 crater, 1 of the bigger ones, is about 600 to 1000 miles from 1 side to the other and whatever that projectile was would have been at least 2 and a 1/2 Miles long .Maybe 3/4 of a mile in width.  And it's gotta be traveling at least 5% at the most 15% speed of light at that distance, moving that fast and that big Of a projectile.
 That would have made a big mess. that could have fractured.  A good portion of the moon slap off. We would have had to Debris here on earth. nerve. And the Mushroom from the impact that only happens in with a nuclear bomb. That
 Would be an explosion makes a Mushroom? And there has to be an environment for the Mushroom to form. There's no  o2  there.
 That projectile would have made that Debris cloud. just like a snowcomb from a point and fan straight out.  In a great big cone shape, there would have been no Mushroom."
10734,bfThiqDd9FA,Good imagination that should be appreciated for a 10 year kid.
10735,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone believes we actually went to the moon in 1969.
10736,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you’re faking a video, at least don’t make the extra crap you’re adding to it in such a high resolution 😂 amateur"
10737,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how socks keep my feet warm.
10738,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
10739,bfThiqDd9FA,"unless they get wet, then not so much"
10740,bfThiqDd9FA,YES
10741,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's a fast rocket. 6,300,000km/h"
10742,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust disappeared in 10 seconds
10743,bfThiqDd9FA,I love seeing how everyone loves to talk I love it
10744,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how this showed up when I searched for ""juniper dunes jeep"""
10745,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart
10746,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how.....nothing more, I just love how!!"
10747,bfThiqDd9FA,(I love how) BEST COMMENT!
10748,bfThiqDd9FA,aaaahahahahahaaaa!
10749,bfThiqDd9FA,"The dust wouldn't even form that shape on the moon, because of the lack of atmoshere there. Not even to mention that it would take weeks of it to reach that hight, not seconds."
10750,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂 looks like it was made by Disney back in the 80s
10751,bfThiqDd9FA,"Tell it to a sailor on a horse, lolol"
10752,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone keeps saying I love how… 

Sent from my iPhone….

If you know you know.."
10753,bfThiqDd9FA,The end is nigh.
10754,bfThiqDd9FA,I love sleeping late on Saturday
10755,bfThiqDd9FA,If something hit the moon it would take 2 minutes for a cloud that big
10756,bfThiqDd9FA,lolz 🤣
10757,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart is where white clouds come from
10758,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the person shooting this knew exactly when it was going to happen and when it finally did they weren't surprised.
10759,bfThiqDd9FA,At least it wasn't here on earth
10760,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is 2 years old and I’m just now seeing this in my timeline.
10761,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactly
10762,bfThiqDd9FA,Same 😭
10763,bfThiqDd9FA,I’m just now seeing it myself!!
10764,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
10765,bfThiqDd9FA,you've crossed timelines
10766,bfThiqDd9FA,I love your mom
10767,bfThiqDd9FA,Moron you couldn't see a rocked even if it crashed into the moon from earth
10768,bfThiqDd9FA,Seriously...🤦‍♀ I'm trying to find a celestial event channel following the sudden death of Astral Photographer Alyn Wallace - and *this* is what YouTube offers?
10769,bfThiqDd9FA,"Astrophotographer, not ""astral photographer"" and what is a celestial event channel?"
10770,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Noorthia , thank you. I usually double check my spelling, but I only just discovered Mr. Wallace had passed away, and I'm a little shook up - not that it's an excuse for not proof-reading a comment. Alyn Wallace's channel detailed upcoming celestial events that could be photographed, and gave recommendations for settings, stacking, etc."
10771,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my eyes water when I take my first piss in the morning.
10772,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how nobody says a fkn thing about it being the middle of the day with birds chirping and the full moon is out not to mention you can see detail of the surface of it that isnt visible from earth with the naked eye!
10773,bfThiqDd9FA,"That’s clearly not a full moon, though."
10774,bfThiqDd9FA,That's awesome!  I too keep a video camera trained on the moon 24/7 for just such an occasion!  🙄
10775,bfThiqDd9FA,"White smoke, a new pope i guess?"
10776,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is very dark on its surface like dark asphalt.  It's lighter underneath so any plumb would look really bright compared with the moon.  You'd also see colour because it would result in super heated ejecta.  It would take hours to look that size.  Still, that would look boring this is far better and what is use in a film."
10777,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how....
10778,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every comment begins with I love how.
10779,bfThiqDd9FA,"I dont love :( STOP!!!!!! """"pub youtube"""" on screan !!!!! why is not correct!!!!!! ON NE VOIS PLUS LA VIDEO!!!!! :((((((( 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
10780,bfThiqDd9FA,bull...
10781,bfThiqDd9FA,🌝💨
10782,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why in the fudge are there 5,739 comments (this number is not at all random, i promise, you cant lie on youtube) that start with, ""I love how.......""? same person, different bot?   same bot different person?  wish i could use that drake meme right about now.."
10783,bfThiqDd9FA,I saw the moon move a little 🤣
10784,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the rising dust forms a mushroom cloud, even though there's no air in space to create a mushroom cloud."
10785,bfThiqDd9FA,your science is bad for my eyes....
10786,bfThiqDd9FA,Wurde der Mond angegriffen?
10787,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how that ""rocket part"" was bigger than anything we have ever sent into space."
10788,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullish
10789,bfThiqDd9FA,There will be no dust cloud on the moon
10790,bfThiqDd9FA,😮😮...A DI ĐÀ PHẬT...A DI ĐÀ PHẬT...NAM MÔ QUÁN THẾ ÂM BỒ TÁT....lần đầu tiên con thấy😮
10791,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dude new this was gonna happen and started filming mins before explosion 😅🤪😉
10792,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon during the day when the birds are chirping. Cool thing! That was the night chill out of the birds.
10793,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all love how
10794,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how I love how
10795,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a missile fired from Pluto to retaliate for us declaring them not a planet. They hit our moon as a warning. The Earth itself is next!
10796,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my dog sounds when he's snoring. 😜
10797,bfThiqDd9FA,And I love why.

10799,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
10800,bfThiqDd9FA,It took a lot of overcomming for me to comment this cartoon. The video is just what it is. What motivates someone to write such a fairy tale? My only question is whether something like this can be treated...
10801,bfThiqDd9FA,Derp
10802,bfThiqDd9FA,"😂😂😂😂

If I didn’t know how reality worked I’d say this looked good"
10803,bfThiqDd9FA,"Quite funny how there is air resistance in the smoke plume... in space, LOLOLOL"
10804,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is a load of shite.
10805,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is 238,886 miles away anybody that believes this I got some oceanfront property in Arizona for sale 😂😂😂"

10809,bfThiqDd9FA,True 💀
10810,bfThiqDd9FA,"funny enough, I just read that your comment was made ""2"" MONTHS AGO! hOW?"
10811,bfThiqDd9FA,Missing the death star.
10812,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is not that big
10813,bfThiqDd9FA,Still pretty big though.

10863,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud is an explosion gif desaturated and slowed down.
10864,bfThiqDd9FA,There are 10 million idiots out there
10865,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
10866,bfThiqDd9FA,I like the part where the explosion was a slower framerate than the video. Keep trying fools. This is an embarrassing troll.
10867,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks more like a Moon fart.
10868,bfThiqDd9FA,Everyone saying love how but no one know how to love
10869,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the astrophysicist comes out in all of us when we see a video like this.
10870,bfThiqDd9FA,nice!! for a Dr Who episode - not reality
10871,bfThiqDd9FA,Next gov scam..Moon orbit change crisis... ..and the banning of the use of glue because we have to stock pile it to stick the moon back together  again..  .. looking at the moon gives you cancer..  ..moon shadows change the climate so... we have to wage war on the moon to save humanity..  .everything we say is safe and effective.   ..bend over and trust the science..
10872,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not bad CG but WAY or of proportion, not to mention you wouldn't see the rocket at all from this distance unless it's some huge ALIEN mother ship LMAO what a click bait creep"

10915,bfThiqDd9FA,soooo.. the moon farted?
10916,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how when I explode I start to skip millions of frames.
10917,bfThiqDd9FA,Love the 2 frame a second explosion that is like 10% the size of the moon XD
10918,bfThiqDd9FA,Haha .. nice graphics! New games are gonna rule.

1 John 5:13 KJV 
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Romans 1:16-17 KJV
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. (Anyone who believes). 

2 Corinthians 11:3 KJV
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

1 John 3:19-24 KJV
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

All have, currently and will continue to sin in this flesh, it is impossible for any man on the earth to stop sinning, we need a saviour, Jesus Paid for my sins.
Do not let any man deceive you, there is nothing mankind can do on our own, read the Word of God. KNOW YOU ARE SAVED TODAY ❤"

10954,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how large and clear the moon is at that time of day. I was actually able to see  the rocket take out an Apollo landing sight.

10966,bfThiqDd9FA,After it passed the cloaked ship that looks the clouds in the sky it reappeared and then landed on the pleadian moon and rung it like a dinner bell and i can tell you it's still ringing or buzz to this day!!!!!!
10967,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope everyone recognizes that this is a composite photo of clouds AI image alteration and trick photography.

10974,bfThiqDd9FA,Your mom in tong
10975,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you know how big that plane would have to be to see it from earth. Even the biggest thing mas has made can not be seen from the moon.
10976,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cocaine forms a cloud of dust
10977,bfThiqDd9FA,Come on you would've had me if i had not been watching anime most my life..but a crash explosion that big from the view of earth would've caused a significant amount of damage to the moon😂 and on top of that the explosion was dead on with the impact there was no delay it seemed like a domino effect😅 or did you really  record this?
10978,bfThiqDd9FA,I haven't been avare that moon has the atmosphere.
10979,bfThiqDd9FA,Quello che vuole anche farci capire che se ci impegnamo possiamo sentire il rumore dell'impatto!!!!  Dai su possiamo  riuscirci anche noi...

10991,bfThiqDd9FA,"The video description makes absolutely no sense at all

Just like a Net.    The rise of Facebook was a parallel to the rise of Trump. 
We are all trapped on a big sticky web!    
This video is a perfect example of why we are likely doomed to drown in our own misinformation quicksand.  
It bothers me to contemplate how many people would have never considered the preposterous physics of this video, and marveled at it saying something like,  “that’s badass!”    Our country is becoming one big loud monster truck rally"

11135,bfThiqDd9FA,People actually believe this shit 😂
11136,bfThiqDd9FA,"- There are no celestial bodies travelling at 300 km/s in the solar system. 
- The ""cloud"" reaches about 100 times the escape velocity and then stays with the moon.
- A 10 km large celestial body travelling at 300 km/s would have ""caused"" an enormous ""firework display"" that would have been visible for days and would have hurled huge chunks towards the Earth.

11164,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the person shooting this knew exactly when it was going to happen and when it finally did they weren't surprised.
11165,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont
11166,bfThiqDd9FA,😆
11167,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yea that's a little big, I don't even think if tsar bomba hit that it would look like that but idk!"
11168,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how unrealistic the physics and scale of that stock video explosion look when after effected onto the Moon
11169,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont
11170,bfThiqDd9FA,"It is videos like this that fuel misinformation, conspiracy theories, ignorance and idiocy"
11171,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it’s been a year and everyone starting their comment with the same thing 🤣🤣🤣
11172,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont. they cant come up with anything else because they dont even speak english.
11173,bfThiqDd9FA,and i dont speak either
11174,bfThiqDd9FA,Un pet lunaire
11175,bfThiqDd9FA,We are lucky enought that moon defend us for centuries. If that asteroid hit us. It would be at least 100times devastated than a nuke. 💀💀💀💀💀
11176,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how?
11177,bfThiqDd9FA,yes you do
11178,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy to watch the cloud almost travel the speed of light
11179,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see the object in OUR atmosphere before it hits the moon.
11180,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont
11181,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
11182,bfThiqDd9FA,yes you do
11183,bfThiqDd9FA,Eu não aguento mais isso
11184,bfThiqDd9FA,"wow, how lucky it was that the camera was centered on the moon AND at the exact right time AND that the moon was so large AND it was so visible during a bright, clear day!  How lucky we are that the content creator knew it was a rocket part that crashed into the moon."
11185,bfThiqDd9FA,"😂😂😂Fajne😂😂😂 kulka robi dziurę w piłce, z której schodzi powietrze😂😂😂😂"
11186,bfThiqDd9FA,CLICKBAIT  !!
11187,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart

11197,bfThiqDd9FA,That exploson is like 500k4
11198,bfThiqDd9FA,And that's how cloud's are made guys
11199,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that camera shakes.
11200,bfThiqDd9FA,Is anyone going to just ignore the fact that the moon is just out in broad day light? Like birds are literally chirping ☠☠
11201,bfThiqDd9FA,"You do occasionally see the moon during the day, but never so big & clear."
11202,bfThiqDd9FA,NON CI CREDO!!
11203,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂
11204,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon just farted 😂🍑💨
11205,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how.......😂
11206,bfThiqDd9FA,All are saying I love mee to😂
11207,bfThiqDd9FA,"Is this ""I love how"" comments section an inside joke or is everyone just that redundant? Not unlike this comment here, I know, but still.."
11208,bfThiqDd9FA,its the bots. youtube is full of bots. and the indian programmers dont know english
11209,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that moon have same gravity
11210,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont. learn english
11211,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart

Fatene uno su Saturno!! (Anche se è fatto di gas, che ve ne frega! 😉🤣)"
11213,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how i am watching this
11214,bfThiqDd9FA,wow
11215,bfThiqDd9FA,@@pumppupappi unbelievable
11216,bfThiqDd9FA,"Damn bro got that IPhone 32 camera with over 238,855 miles of 8k focus"
11217,bfThiqDd9FA,"For something to cause that amount of smoke and be visible,  the object had to been the size of a country since the moon isn't small."
11218,bfThiqDd9FA,😂 stop it! 😂 so dumb..
11219,bfThiqDd9FA,mmm Idk
11220,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud was nearly half of the diameter of the moon
11221,bfThiqDd9FA,no you dont
11222,bfThiqDd9FA,This was on the news right after the Biden isn't senile and wants to actually close the borders segment of the news.
11223,bfThiqDd9FA,😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
11224,bfThiqDd9FA,Dam love how the dust cloud glitched as it was getting bigger 😂
11225,bfThiqDd9FA,If only the moon was really this close to earth we'd have hella waves
11226,bfThiqDd9FA,yeah no thanks i dont like the ocean.
11227,bfThiqDd9FA,What an idiotic video!!!
11228,bfThiqDd9FA,how many ETs were killed ?
11229,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the moon, where is the actual footage of the crash?"
11230,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you with how everything you how however…
11231,bfThiqDd9FA,drunk
11232,bfThiqDd9FA,"in space there would be no downward force like from the air on earth to make that mushroom shape cloud, it would all go straight out."
11233,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
11234,bfThiqDd9FA,"Video recording 25fps, smoke effect from the moon 5 fps.
And why was the colliding object a giant perfectly-shaped pixel?"
11235,bfThiqDd9FA,you forgot the boom
11236,bfThiqDd9FA,"😂 😂😂 nice 👍🏼 not believable, but funny!"
11237,bfThiqDd9FA,the rocket part finally got the job it was careering for.
11238,bfThiqDd9FA,How stupid do you think we are??
11239,bfThiqDd9FA,Are all of these commenters bots or something? Wth
11240,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how
11241,bfThiqDd9FA,yes they are
11242,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they passed the Turing test.
11243,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the shape of the explosion cloud is perfect...
On the surface of the goddamn moon."
11244,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon Saves earth Rescwpt moon.
11245,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all survived this...
11246,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that NASA statement was written by someone whose first language isn't English.
11247,bfThiqDd9FA,I dont love how dinosaurs died on the moon
11248,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't explode the moon this is born on Jesus notebook
11249,bfThiqDd9FA,nah lets explode it
11250,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people are all going to vote for Trump
11251,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh brother. Video LAB says it all. Total BS.
11252,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments
11253,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks more like a atomic bomb
11254,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is 20 ft away
11255,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how…
Just like everybody loves how here"

11259,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon protect Earth from asteroids, like Terminator protect young John Connor  from the bullets. That is way Moon looks like cheese with holes..."
11260,bfThiqDd9FA,"People, This 100% bullshit, The moon is 238,856 miles from earth, It is impossible to see any spacecraft on the surface let alone any impact of anything that would hit the moon. Its would be too small to see. use Common sense when watching stupid videos like this!"
11261,bfThiqDd9FA,Maa aliens are throwing crap again at the moon
11262,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah that would make news😂
11263,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody' loves how.
11264,bfThiqDd9FA,I love all the love in these comments
11265,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this has got 10M views
11266,bfThiqDd9FA,Comments amuse. My first thought: whose responsible? The vid editor
11267,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds were oblivious to this disturbance  in the Force.
11268,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you know how big that would have to be to see it that far away
11269,bfThiqDd9FA,That was your last brain cell imagining ...
11270,bfThiqDd9FA,So ein Schwachsinn !!!😂😂😂
11271,bfThiqDd9FA,If that camera caught that on the moon how tall are those trees 🗿

11275,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how a bird's peeping can cause something to fly into the moon.  A space egg, perhaps?"
11276,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate everything you all love ! 😅
11277,bfThiqDd9FA,Love the mushroom cloud and object hitting the moon at 10% light speed
11278,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how far the internet has gone, and I also love whoever believes this."
11279,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon was to fart 😂
11280,bfThiqDd9FA,the speed of that object is 5800 miles /hour when it hit the moon.   It is a piece of debris from a Space X rocket.
11281,bfThiqDd9FA,No eair parsure   on moon
11282,bfThiqDd9FA,Ai. Bullshit
11283,bfThiqDd9FA,А че она не сдулась?
11284,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11285,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my mom makes me sandwiches.
11286,bfThiqDd9FA,You would not see a rocket hitting the moon let alone see it traveling with the naked eye unless said rocket was the size of a fucking mountain 😂
11287,bfThiqDd9FA,That dust cloud is literally hundreds of miles across 😂
11288,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much people type love in the comment section..
11289,bfThiqDd9FA,NASA is wasting People's money
11290,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
11291,bfThiqDd9FA,"Easy to spot fakes like this because when objects are very far away they tend to always look slower.  Like in slow motion . 
The plum was way too fast for the distance !"
11292,bfThiqDd9FA,LMMFAO. Joke footage.
11293,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how people are using ""Ilove i love ilove ilove"" again and again in the comment section😂"
11294,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the smell of napalm on the moon...
11295,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
11296,bfThiqDd9FA,FPS взрыва медленней чем движение облаков. Да и увидеть такое так😂😂
11297,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the man in the moon jumped off with his parachute in sheer terror
11298,bfThiqDd9FA,Gente que falta de atenção isso aconteceu a 60 milhões de anos😅 só agora a gente pôde ver esse evento.
11299,bfThiqDd9FA,Pepsi
11300,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow moon is unusually big and smoke looks lagy.I wonder why...
11301,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how, everyone's commenting  with a sarcastic, I love how , so original"
11302,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
11303,bfThiqDd9FA,Nonsense of coursw
11304,bfThiqDd9FA,about as genuine as my foot long penis
11305,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon has 30fps?
11306,bfThiqDd9FA,The size of this rocketpart was at least 30km in diameter. Imagine how big the rocket was! Who was ist? NASA? The Russians? The Chinese? 3rd Reich????
11307,bfThiqDd9FA,NICE BUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLSHITT
11308,bfThiqDd9FA,"And nobody realize how close the moon are from earth in this video. Tell me, do nobody really not thinking Straigth anymore? Damn use your senses..."
11309,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you can see the object approaching the moon which is 240,000 miles away ."
11310,bfThiqDd9FA,So much YouTube bull shit
11311,bfThiqDd9FA,Fart?
11312,bfThiqDd9FA,OMD !! What is that? 🌕☄️
11313,bfThiqDd9FA,lmao @ the physics education level of whoever made this.  🤦‍♂
11314,bfThiqDd9FA,Extremely unsettling
11315,bfThiqDd9FA,The birds are so casual
11316,bfThiqDd9FA,"boy, you think we believe that. seeing a rocket crash, with a cellphone. are you nuts?"
11317,bfThiqDd9FA,He doesnt give a shi#... It's about the views. He gets paid per 1000 views and makes a pretty good living doing this.
11318,bfThiqDd9FA,AI has arrived ... let's use it for good than nonsense please ...
11319,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the cheese 🧀 cloud formed so quickly that none of had a chance to fly to the moon 🌚 with a bunch of nachos and other snacks!

Next time give us some notice!!!

11320,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is farting
11321,bfThiqDd9FA,Que mentiraaaaaa
11322,bfThiqDd9FA,It's saitama
11323,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
11324,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud of dust had more detail than the moon.
11325,bfThiqDd9FA,Que clase se me tira eso no es verdad
11326,bfThiqDd9FA,How far away have they told us the moon is? ROFLMAO
11327,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how I love
11328,bfThiqDd9FA,So funny
11329,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro studied physics at KFC
11330,bfThiqDd9FA,bull shit
11331,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moving WAY too fast relative to the moon for such a small explosion. Things move fast in space but if it was going say a typical 50,000 mph relative to the moon it would be 40x slower. If you consider the diameter of the moon and then you look how fast the meteor in the video is traveling it looks like it's going 2 million miles per hour. At that speed the kinetic energy might just destroy the moon. At a minimum a much larger explosion."
11332,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is smokin that wacky tabackie
11333,bfThiqDd9FA,"Clouds moving BEHIND the moon....its not as far away as N.ASA says it is.  Oh, and do you ever question why you see the moon during daylight when we are told it should be on the orher side of the ""globe"". Maybe we luve on a flat immovable earth under a firmament like Genesis explains. 🎉🎉"
11334,bfThiqDd9FA,"""Shit where is my mask that damn moon farted again"" 💀"
11335,bfThiqDd9FA,"Alien:- Sorry guys, my remote control plane crashed on your moon."
11336,bfThiqDd9FA,Toot!
11337,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
11338,bfThiqDd9FA,People have to much time on their hands.  Go get a job you bum.
11339,bfThiqDd9FA,😅
11340,bfThiqDd9FA,U would see the impact bloom along longer then that my guy 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
11341,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, is the moon supposed to be really really tiny, or is the rocket part the size of a city."
11342,bfThiqDd9FA,The classic moon fart 😂
11343,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you wanna trick people you need to render more then 10 frames a second on your ""debris cloud""."
11344,bfThiqDd9FA,Shit
11345,bfThiqDd9FA,Utter shite.
11346,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket part is literally larger than the state of Delaware.
11347,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there's a full moon in the middle of the day
11348,bfThiqDd9FA,Please. Is anyone stupid enough to believe this shyte?!?
11349,bfThiqDd9FA,You would never see that from earth without a telescope.

11353,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how there's a moon in daylight
11354,bfThiqDd9FA,"Based on the diameter of the moon (3,474.  km).  It took the rocket 3 second to travel a moon width. That means the rocket was traveling at 1000 + km a second. 
The fastest space craft ever was NASA Parker Solar Probe  that used the sun's gravitational pull to travel 176 km a second.
So there's that too"
11355,bfThiqDd9FA,I think it was a ship coming out of hyperspace and then a bit like coming to a traffic light that goes orange at an awkward distance where you don't think you can stop and you think about it and then say fuck it and plow on through and realise your judgement isn't what it used to be and everything goes south.

11359,bfThiqDd9FA,"Cool graphic, but there are several physics errors, not the least of which is the dispersion pattern of the post-crash debris. There is no atmosphere on the moon to create the ""mushroom"" effect shown. Also, the speed at which the ""rocket"" approaches the moon, as well as the speed of the debris field are impossibly high. 
Do better, guys."
11360,bfThiqDd9FA,"I am Just Surprised to see the ""BIG CLEAR VISIBLE MOON during the DAY!"""

11363,bfThiqDd9FA,O looks like the moon is growing a white moon tree
11364,bfThiqDd9FA,That's fd up
11365,bfThiqDd9FA,Thinks
11366,bfThiqDd9FA,"No, the rocket's impact on the moon will not be visible from Earth. And there are several reasons for this: Experts have calculated that the runaway rocket stage will impact on the edge of the approximately 570 kilometer wide Hertzsprung crater. This crater is located on the far side of the Moon, which is never visible from Earth. But even if the rocket were to hit somewhere else: On March 4, 2022, the moon is only illuminated by around five percent of sunlight (full moon* is not until March 18) - there is a high probability that you will then see the impact site can, should be low."

11374,bfThiqDd9FA,All of these comments are demonstrative of the Youtube generation (16-35 year olds):  underachieving idiots living in their parents spare bedroom who are obsessed with being  the smartest and wittiest person online. They spend free time arguing on Reddit while the country goes to shit. 🙄
11375,bfThiqDd9FA,Everyone loves this video 🎉 😂😂

11391,bfThiqDd9FA,Relax guys the moon just farted 😢😂😂😂
11392,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love
11393,bfThiqDd9FA,Which would also mean mars couldn't be that far away
11394,bfThiqDd9FA,Then that means the moon couldn't be 100s of years away as they stated it would have to be like driving to Oregon from Washington state
11395,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats faker than a Kardashians butt
11396,bfThiqDd9FA,I clicked this video knowing beforehand it would make me laugh
11397,bfThiqDd9FA,i am the witness of this event on moon
11398,bfThiqDd9FA,now i know how big a moon 😁
11399,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes the physics in this is 100% accurate…..😂

11403,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is visible during the day all the time but it's just too big here as well as the impact being a low frame rate.
11404,bfThiqDd9FA,That eould be an object the size of alaska traveling at relativistic speed. Pretty sure the moon would be atomized.

11420,bfThiqDd9FA,How exactly did that mushroom cloud form in the vacuum of space?
11421,bfThiqDd9FA,"i’m no astronomer so i’m just confused on how they can see that happening when it’s in space? like even if it’s a big rocket, the moon is 1000000 times bigger than a rocket so just how when the moon isn’t even IN the earth it’s in space"
11422,bfThiqDd9FA,Just dumb
11423,bfThiqDd9FA,meh ..you can clearly se all the craters and holes on the moon are tottaly round and all facing earth because all hits are from earth to the moon
11424,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all the cloud dont just dissipate in that fashion
11425,bfThiqDd9FA,That'll get the wobble out of it!
11426,bfThiqDd9FA,We have a bigger issue if the moon is that close already
11427,bfThiqDd9FA,"wow, its vey realistic😂"
11428,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how large it is relative to the trees
11429,bfThiqDd9FA,lame as hell
11430,bfThiqDd9FA,"OMG, 10M views for a such a lie. Great way of making money! There are two group of people in this world, those who manufacture garbage, and those who buy the garbage. Which group you are in?"
11431,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the bird of my garden that went to the moon
11432,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate people that copy other people and go with the herd. 🐑  They lied to you but you lack intellect and are not bright enough too realise
11433,bfThiqDd9FA,Any why an object may crash into the moon while the earth with much stronger gravity is around the corner?
11434,bfThiqDd9FA,if you look really close to the rocket it freezes and it disappeared then the smoke pops out and the rocket is gone but after it freezes it the rocket pops out of nowhere and just before the crash there a light its red and really small but I see it then the ship freezes and then the smoke I dk it looks weird if you look closely you can see it . :)
11435,bfThiqDd9FA,@joerogan
11436,bfThiqDd9FA,Plenty of hits came from the viid though. 1st reaction was omg. Then I thought ah? This is you tube
11437,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I love"" skyrockets in trends"
11438,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon poot.
11439,bfThiqDd9FA,Will someone buy this kid an ice cream cone and get him back in the car....
11440,bfThiqDd9FA,The sonic boom would be massive.
11441,bfThiqDd9FA,Would be how it works if it were flat.
11442,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit!
11443,bfThiqDd9FA,"To je samozřejmě nesmysl.
Protože hřibovitý jaderný mrak na tenké stopce je důsledek existence relativně husté atmosféry na Zemi. 
Na Měsíci by se zbytky po  výbuchu šířily u jako polokoule, případně kónický válec.
A tak velký objekt při takové rychlosti by vytvořil z hornin Měsíce obrovské množství plazmy, které by se nám opticky jevila jako povrch Slunce..."
11444,bfThiqDd9FA,月の軌道変わっど
11445,bfThiqDd9FA,Dang I didn't know asteroids impact at 12 FPS when the camera recording shoots at 60.
11446,bfThiqDd9FA,Bllsht
11447,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is not that close
11448,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah, it's BS!!"
11449,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you could see it from earth like that, the moon would be destoryed with an object that big and the human race would all die."
11450,bfThiqDd9FA,I love tacos and watching cool videos
11451,bfThiqDd9FA,sheer trash !!! 😂😂😂
11452,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmfao gay
11453,bfThiqDd9FA,Grow up
11454,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahah this was so funny
11455,bfThiqDd9FA,Kids and their new computers
11456,bfThiqDd9FA,Ni en la luna están a salbo la población palestina.😢😢😢😢❤
11457,bfThiqDd9FA,Well reading your comments there is one thing really clear: there is so much love in the world...
11458,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
11459,bfThiqDd9FA,That can’t be good.🤔
11460,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahaha dobre👎🖕
11461,bfThiqDd9FA,Saiyans arrived
11462,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon just let out a BIG FARTED 😮
11463,bfThiqDd9FA,Isn't it funny that no one in history of the Earth has ever seen a Meteorite strike the Moon? 🤔
11464,bfThiqDd9FA,...we have but okay
11465,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon goes 😮‍💨
11466,bfThiqDd9FA,The MUSHROOM IN THE VACCUUM OF SPACE (not possible)have some shitty ping i guess😂🎉
11467,bfThiqDd9FA,"All I see is a women, mooning, pantless and then fart."
11468,bfThiqDd9FA,How many aliens 👽 did die??😂😂
11469,bfThiqDd9FA,"People who think we live on a spinning ball are dumb , see in moon in the sky clear as day and pretty much stays in the same area"
11470,bfThiqDd9FA,Are you trolling or really that uneducated? 😂
11471,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon doesnt look that nice day or night
11472,bfThiqDd9FA,"A mushrooms cloud,  zero shockwave, and zero firey molten lava."
11473,bfThiqDd9FA,uhm we wore in space and didnt see that hmm sus
11474,bfThiqDd9FA,"' Loud fart noise intensify """
11475,bfThiqDd9FA,"Me while being high: wow, the moon just farted..kekekeke"
11476,bfThiqDd9FA,"LMFAO!!! Was Lord Helmet firing a shot from Spaceball I? He MISSED! shit passed between earth and the moon, but somehow hit? If an object big enough to make the kind of reaction on the moons surface you could see from earth… that bitch would have been detectable for YEARS before it approached… and then if it made that big of an impact you better believe we would have devastating fallout from it on earth given trajectory of impact and direction of debris."
11477,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap cap cap cap 😂😂😂😂😂
11478,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Ebony bubble butts
11479,bfThiqDd9FA,Cause this is so believable
11480,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
11481,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
11482,bfThiqDd9FA,Farted moon😂😂😂
11483,bfThiqDd9FA,I think the moon farted
11484,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the explosion is at 10fps while everything else is normal
11485,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how y'all actually measured the fps...
11486,bfThiqDd9FA,Mdr le mec qui a fait cette video n y connait peut etre rien en math mais il gere grave les reseaux et le manque de logique de l etre humain ..  et peut etre meme sa stupidité...  10M de vues haha mdr c est un vrai malin et finalement pas si mauvais en math et en science humaine qu'il n y parait...  pask tout le monde court regarde et lui rapporte de la tune 😂👏
11487,bfThiqDd9FA,"Eventually YouTubers will stop wasting people's time with thie crap.  Maybe YouTube could cut revenues for content of little or no value, or just making crap up."
11488,bfThiqDd9FA,Much science.
11489,bfThiqDd9FA,"So um, those whose theory that the Earth and moon is flat 😂"
11490,bfThiqDd9FA,At least this one doesn't have any noise from the impact 😂
11491,bfThiqDd9FA,Here for the all the expert commentary from all the people that never been to the moon.
11492,bfThiqDd9FA,You don't have to have been on the moon to know it's bs ^^
11493,bfThiqDd9FA,Hey👽the thing that hit the Moon was the size of Texas👽
11494,bfThiqDd9FA,Seriously?
11495,bfThiqDd9FA,I know what caused that. It was the book with all the allegations of the hundreds of rules broke by Man City.they took it to space and threw it out the window of the iss and it landed on the moon.
11496,bfThiqDd9FA,"I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, show this also to thy servant: whether after death, as soon as every one of us yields up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come when thou wilt renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented at once?"" 76 He answered me and said, ""I will show you that also, but do not be associated with those who have shown scorn, nor number yourself among those who are tormented. 77 For you have a treasure of works laid up with the Most High; but it will not be shown to you until the last times. 

78 Now, concerning death, the teaching is: When the decisive decree has gone forth from the Most High that a man shall die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, first of all it adores the glory of the Most High. 79 And if it is one of those who have shown scorn and have not kept the way of the Most High, and who have despised his law, and who have hated those who fear the Most High -- 80 such spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall immediately wander about in torments, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways. 

81 The first way, because they have scorned the law of the Most High. 82 The second way, because they cannot now make a good repentance that they may live. 83 The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have trusted the covenants of the Most High. 84 The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days. 85 The fifth way, they shall see how the habitations of the others are guarded by angels in profound quiet. 86 The sixth way, they shall see how some of them will pass over into torments. 87 The seventh way, which is worse than all the ways that have been mentioned, because they shall utterly waste away in confusion and be consumed with shame, and shall wither with fear at seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they sinned while they were alive, and before whom they are to be judged in the last times. 

88 ""Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from their mortal body. 89 During the time that they lived in it, they laboriously served the Most High, and withstood danger every hour, that they might keep the law of the Lawgiver perfectly. 90 Therefore this is the teaching concerning them: 91 First of all, they shall see with great joy the glory of him who receives them, for they shall have rest in seven orders.

 92 The first order, because they have striven with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was formed with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death. 93 The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the unrighteous wander, and the punishment that awaits them. 94 The third order, they see the witness which he who formed them bears concerning them, that while they were alive they kept the law which was given them in trust. 95 The fourth order, they understand the rest which they now enjoy, being gathered into their chambers and guarded by angels in profound quiet, and the glory which awaits them in the last days. 96 The fifth order, they rejoice that they have now escaped what is corruptible, and shall inherit what is to come; 

and besides they see the straits and toil from which they have been delivered, and the spacious liberty which they are to receive and enjoy in immortality. 97 The sixth order, when it is shown to them how their face is to shine like the sun, and how they are to be made like the light of the stars, being incorruptible from then on. 98 The seventh order, which is greater than all that have been mentioned, because they shall rejoice with boldness, and shall be confident without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom they served in life and from whom they are to receive their reward when glorified. 

99 This is the order of the souls of the righteous, as henceforth is announced; and the aforesaid are the ways of torment which those who would not give heed shall suffer hereafter."" 100 I answered and said, ""Will time therefore be given to the souls, after they have been separated from the bodies, to see what you have described to me?"" 101 He said to me, ""They shall have freedom for seven days, so that during these seven days they may see the things of which you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered in their habitations."" 

102 I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, show further to me, thy servant, whether on the day of judgment the righteous will be able to intercede for the unrighteous or to entreat the Most High for them, 103 fathers for sons or sons for parents, brothers for brothers, relatives for their kinsmen, or friends for those who are most dear."" 104 He answered me and said, ""Since you have found favor in my sight, I will show you this also. The day of judgment is decisive and displays to all the seal of truth. Just as now a father does not send his son, or a son his father, or a master his servant, or a friend his dearest friend, to be ill or sleep or eat or be healed in his stead, 105 so no one shall ever pray for another on that day, neither shall any one lay a burden on another; for then every one shall bear his own righteousness and unrighteousness."" 2 Esdras 7:75

11499,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah man, I saw it too"
11500,bfThiqDd9FA,So stupid
11501,bfThiqDd9FA,banning this channel with all it's deceit from my feed. bubye!
11502,bfThiqDd9FA,（ツッコミどころは色々ありますが）大気のない月に何かが衝突した場合、跳ね上げられたレキや砂は当然空気抵抗を受けないので、この画像のように雲状にもわっと広がることはありません。科学的知識の乏しい者が科学的なフェイクと作ると噴飯物の動画となるという好例ですね。
11503,bfThiqDd9FA,"Terrible job, especially when it is supposed to be passing behind the clouds."
11504,bfThiqDd9FA,Insane how the photoshopped the asteriod coming towards the moon 😂😂
11505,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
11506,bfThiqDd9FA,Klick generator

11510,bfThiqDd9FA,I love bumming
11511,bfThiqDd9FA,I would say nice CG. But it's actually lame CG.
11512,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bro en la luna no hay aire para que Levante tanta tierra o humo 💨,
 por qué sospecho que  eres editor de video 😅"
11513,bfThiqDd9FA,"Random: Why are you recording?
Dude: KING CRIMSON"
11514,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
11515,bfThiqDd9FA,"Since the moon is full of cheese, it had a lactose moment 😂"
11516,bfThiqDd9FA,It was a Saiyan space pod.
11517,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
11518,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the gta moon
11519,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, fck science"
11520,bfThiqDd9FA,"Terrible attempt to fool people!  You just happened to be filming the moon for no reason, huh?  That smoke ploom upon impact would not have risen that fast the way we see it from so far away. The smoke ploom looks like it would have gone over 300 miles away from the moon with the way you made it so big & tall.  Ridiculous!"
11521,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon had Taco Bell 🌮
11522,bfThiqDd9FA,"Stop doin fakes, some ppl believe that shit"
11523,bfThiqDd9FA,🙂
11524,bfThiqDd9FA,Fiction!

11526,bfThiqDd9FA,Fotomontaż
11527,bfThiqDd9FA,Ah yes🌝
11528,bfThiqDd9FA,"daaaamn, the explosion was so big it gave space some air for the smoke to rise, crazy"
11529,bfThiqDd9FA,Как думаете это монтаж😊
11530,bfThiqDd9FA,Я думаю тебе надо идти делать борщ
11531,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember that.. it was when the countries were claiming the moon was there’s because it was sold to them.  I bought a planet that is for sale too
11532,bfThiqDd9FA,Неумелый монтаж.
11533,bfThiqDd9FA,"Damn, the impact was so strong that it reduced the frame rate of the explosion."
11534,bfThiqDd9FA,"R u kidding me. Yah, i have some swamp land i want to sell you. Explosion in the vacuum of space would look nothing like that….. We are doomed if people actually believe this stuff"
11535,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you add film grain and blur to the smoke footage, then it might look a bit realistic."
11536,bfThiqDd9FA,Lagging. Reconnect 😂
11537,bfThiqDd9FA,Ay is that a cloud
11538,bfThiqDd9FA,Did I leave the iron on..???   🤔🤔🤔
11539,bfThiqDd9FA,:)))
11540,bfThiqDd9FA,Doesn't get much faker
11541,bfThiqDd9FA,Anyone who fell for this shit: You’re dumb as hell. Just sayin’
11542,bfThiqDd9FA,Bull$#!÷
11543,bfThiqDd9FA,THIS IS TRUMP'S FAULT
11544,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
11545,bfThiqDd9FA,This really happened. I was there. My dad also invented the question mark.
11546,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg! Mine invented the 😂 emoji!
11547,bfThiqDd9FA,So that's how clouds form....
11548,bfThiqDd9FA,So big and bright moon in day?
11549,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s nothing. I saw an iphone video of the moon hitting the earth and bouncing back coz of all the hard metal
11550,bfThiqDd9FA,Это фейк
11551,bfThiqDd9FA,It's like a cloud
11552,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aha, so the moon has a thick atmosphere and experiences lag."
11553,bfThiqDd9FA,It farted
11554,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the explosion is in 10 fps
11555,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like a moon shart
11556,bfThiqDd9FA,mango
11557,bfThiqDd9FA,
11558,bfThiqDd9FA,I love all these comments.
11559,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
11560,bfThiqDd9FA,Bah..
11561,bfThiqDd9FA,İ love Adobe illüstrator
11562,bfThiqDd9FA,There is a mistake right over there the mistake is it's a day why is the Moon there ?
11563,bfThiqDd9FA,"Almost every comment here starts with ""I love"", wtf"
11564,bfThiqDd9FA,He knows everything before happy. Amazing. 😂
11565,bfThiqDd9FA,Man you really have no clue how big the moon actually is
11566,bfThiqDd9FA,Deshalb gibt es nun keine Dinosaurier auf dem Mond.
11567,bfThiqDd9FA,a new cloud is born
11568,bfThiqDd9FA,I came here for the comments section.
11569,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is pretending to know what they're talking about 😂
11570,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like that the rest of the surface is unaffected by an impact that puts soil in local orbit.

That made me laugh and I needed that today."
11571,bfThiqDd9FA,Well...That is cheap...😁🤣😂
11572,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hilarious for the smart, absolutely frightening for the stupid.  🤣🤯"
11573,bfThiqDd9FA,you mean moon fart
11574,bfThiqDd9FA,The 7fps mushroom cloud really tops this off 😂
11575,bfThiqDd9FA,so the moon is that close
11576,bfThiqDd9FA,Of course there'd be a mushroom cloud of sorts it's how it would fall back that would be different remember the feather and the pen on the moon. Close if you look at some of the craters you can see where after the impact debris radiated out from the center. But since we have lots of images of the moon we could go survey the impact area right?
11577,bfThiqDd9FA,The cloud wouldn't have disappeared. That only happens in video games due to hardware limitations.
11578,bfThiqDd9FA,JUST SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE LATEST SOFTWARE ON A PC
11579,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkk funny
11580,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everything looks so clear when the rocket crashed into the Moon and exploded and became 10 times slower and blurrier than the actual video
11581,bfThiqDd9FA,That's because bigfoot clashed into it.
11582,bfThiqDd9FA,Dumb
11583,bfThiqDd9FA,How air came in moon 🤔
11584,bfThiqDd9FA,FAKER THAN MY EX
11585,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how, I love how,"
11586,bfThiqDd9FA,For the rocket to be that visible it would have been bigger that an aircraft carrier. Also that had a lot of power. Lies all lies.
11587,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
11588,bfThiqDd9FA,You can see the string😂
11589,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ridiculous. One second after the impact, the dust is already 1/7 diameter of the moon high, meaning 500km in one second. Many people totaly overestimate this. A object moving ""only"" 20km/s (similar as the dust ejected from the moon let's say) is almost not visible, so slow it is. Here the speed is 25-50x too big..."
11590,bfThiqDd9FA,That is dumb and disheartening.
11591,bfThiqDd9FA,Это прилунение Апполона-11😂
11592,bfThiqDd9FA,"not bad.
make the cloud move lil slower, moving straight (the moon has no atmosphere, so no turbulences) like a cone just a lil curving over time due to gravity and more and more translucent the further away from the moon."
11593,bfThiqDd9FA,Hilarious. Size perspective is way off.
11594,bfThiqDd9FA,Montagem ridícula 😂
11595,bfThiqDd9FA,Nothing about this seems authentic
11596,bfThiqDd9FA,(AI) is as good as those who use it.  LOL's
11597,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11598,bfThiqDd9FA,That image is that far away the clouds of dust or smoke you see is super big the moon is very big that size would be hundreds of kilometres hight more its a load shit
11599,bfThiqDd9FA,Sérieux vous croyez ce truc ?? de 1 les proportion 2 le propagtion des fumées net et rapide ?? allons allons
11600,bfThiqDd9FA,Ah yes. A 15 Frames-Per-Second explosión
11601,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest thing ı have ever seen
11602,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats no moon.......its a space station
11603,bfThiqDd9FA,You dip$hits put suggested videos thumbnails at the end directly on top of what you want us to see.
11604,bfThiqDd9FA,Cute.
11605,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing how far tech came today to make fakes like this that fool innocents so easily
11606,bfThiqDd9FA,У меня вопрос. На зачем ставить рекламу следующего видео в то время когда не закончилось видео ? и тем закрывает может самую интересную его часть.
11607,bfThiqDd9FA,All the people that think this Israel probably think the moon is bigger than the Earth too!!😂😂😂
11608,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂bollocks
11609,bfThiqDd9FA,This Video and your wonderful comments made my day👍👍
11610,bfThiqDd9FA,The whole process was quick..... Saved my time
11611,bfThiqDd9FA,Great click bait! You definatly go the views!!
11612,bfThiqDd9FA,bro ain't no way the explostion was that big
11613,bfThiqDd9FA,"WTF! Where is the rest of that important video?? I've heard, two minutes after impact our moon was broken into two pieces and floating away! Since I'm waiting for a new moon comming around!"
11614,bfThiqDd9FA,My man crashed so hard the smoke fps went down
11615,bfThiqDd9FA,that must be a rocket part the side of manhatten
11616,bfThiqDd9FA,Der Einschlag ist genauso ein scheiss wie du.
11617,bfThiqDd9FA,Thee 'Dumbest' video evah.   High School Physics could have gotten anyone through this stupidity.   Shameless.
11618,bfThiqDd9FA,As though you know what it should be and aren’t just mindlessly parroting that moron Neil degrasse tyson 🤣
11619,bfThiqDd9FA,It all makes sense if you don't think about it.
11620,bfThiqDd9FA,I was smoking
11621,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how LatchPrime was here.
11622,bfThiqDd9FA,Its not true 😎
11623,bfThiqDd9FA,Faked 😎

11625,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
11626,bfThiqDd9FA,"I don't put faith in anything that I see on video in this day and time. Actually, at this point, you can't trust anything you see to be what it presents itself to be. We might as well be living in a matrix."
11627,bfThiqDd9FA,CARTOON PHYSICS... that's how the towers fell🤣🤣🤣
11628,bfThiqDd9FA,More crap
11629,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh look everyone...the moon farted!!!
11630,bfThiqDd9FA,love
11631,bfThiqDd9FA,Smoke in space?...hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
11632,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, where is sound? Why don't I hear some sound?"
11633,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks cool but unrealistic. The cloud rises up very quickly. From this distance that would mean some ridiculous speed. 50-60km / sec? Maybe even faster. But it's cool.
11634,bfThiqDd9FA,AI Outcome
11635,bfThiqDd9FA,"20 times+ faster then a COMET ! RIDICULOUS !
3,474 km dia'  of moon / by 3.5 secs = 1000 km/sec approx' !!!

COMET max' speed = 45,000 m/s, [ depending on their location in their orbit ]
SO = 20 times+ faster then a COMET ! RIDICULOUS !"
11636,bfThiqDd9FA,Kkkkkkkk
11637,bfThiqDd9FA,That must have been the biggest cloud blast since the big bang!  😂😂
11638,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂ЛООООЖЬ
11639,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
11640,bfThiqDd9FA,Algo tan natural como que a cualquiera se nos escape un gasesito también le puede pasar a ella dejenla quieta😂
11641,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO!!!!!
11642,bfThiqDd9FA,"My god. If that’s what you think this is, child you need to open a book."
11643,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, it's obviously just the moon farting, people are overreacting."
11644,bfThiqDd9FA,"True but covered up evidence, After the cosmic event SETI pointed all radio telescopes at the moon and heard someone saying, ""So what do you want to do tonight Brain?""...""The same thing we do every night Pinky. Try To Take Over The World."""
11645,bfThiqDd9FA,Never actually seen the moon fart 💨 thanks for that educational insight! 🤪😅 🤡
11646,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not gonna lie ,he had me in the first half . But the mushroom cloud is a dead giveaway."
11647,bfThiqDd9FA,Всралась😂

11655,bfThiqDd9FA,Hoowee! That was slicker than whale snot on a iceberg!
11656,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
11657,bfThiqDd9FA,Look at that the moon farted.
11658,bfThiqDd9FA,No one ever seen a moon fart? Geez no biggie
11659,bfThiqDd9FA,crazy that the poof of the explosion happened in a different framerate
11660,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
11661,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, I also record the moon when it's so large n clear to see in broad daylight!"
11662,bfThiqDd9FA,No death for Camera man
11663,bfThiqDd9FA,"Liberal socialists start by saying ""I love...."""
11664,bfThiqDd9FA,"FALSE! There is no atmosphere on the moon. So there is no puffy cloud. The dust will travel in a strait line from the point of impact. Also, it would take minutes to travel not seconds."
11665,bfThiqDd9FA,What the fuck is this shit???
11666,bfThiqDd9FA,"A fun video to get reactions, likes, comments and subscribes for the posters' entertainment value."
11667,bfThiqDd9FA,I had a turd do that
11668,bfThiqDd9FA,🤔 yeah ok ..?
11669,bfThiqDd9FA,"This video is both very silly because it's so faked af, and pure genius with over 9 million views. This is an excellent video for clickbait. Bravo to the creator, excellent work. Whoever made this video is the new clickbait goat imo.😂"
11670,bfThiqDd9FA,ah yes the moonshroom cloud that definitely has air pushing against it to make it go up
11671,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahahah
11672,bfThiqDd9FA,"Gee that looks really believable. Must have been a town-sized object, since the cross-section of the moon is comparable to the area of Australia, that caused a mushroom cloud the size of the state of NY, with turbulence in an atmosphere that doesn't exist, that disappeared in 5 seconds, bc you know, mushroom clouds do that right."
11673,bfThiqDd9FA,На луну никто и никогда не летал
11674,bfThiqDd9FA,А ты не когда не использовал свои 2 извилины
11675,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes

11677,bfThiqDd9FA,😮
11678,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is 20x bigger in the sky
11679,bfThiqDd9FA,"You know stupid people will believe this, right?"
11680,bfThiqDd9FA,Cartoon Network productions 😄
11681,bfThiqDd9FA,People are enough dumb to believe there an atmospheric environment on moon.
11682,bfThiqDd9FA,It really looks like the moon farted
11683,bfThiqDd9FA,It's true I was the rocket.
11684,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust plumes out through the moon's atmosp... hang on...
11685,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my wife moans during ass play.
11686,bfThiqDd9FA,Its saitama don't worry
11687,bfThiqDd9FA,Okay this comment is actually good.
11688,bfThiqDd9FA,Who farted
11689,bfThiqDd9FA,You definitely failed your physics class
11690,bfThiqDd9FA,"Omg when did the happen? That object seemed to come out of no where, almost as if this is a hoax!!"
11691,bfThiqDd9FA,Sending nukes to the moon huh.
11692,bfThiqDd9FA,🤪😝🤪😜🤪
11693,bfThiqDd9FA,I was waiting to see if it came out the other side....

11696,bfThiqDd9FA,It should be made to look like a heart shape.
11697,bfThiqDd9FA,Do any of these comments begin with “I love”?
11698,bfThiqDd9FA,There's no mushroom on the Moon. There's no atmosphere

11706,bfThiqDd9FA,"I dont think u will see it immediately like tht, it will take over a minute i think for us on earth to see it"
11707,bfThiqDd9FA,Rubbish.  Some people will do anything to get clicks on YouTube.
11708,bfThiqDd9FA,I went to see THE BATMAN.

11711,bfThiqDd9FA,"Everybody who believes this stupid nonsense, should be institutionalised."
11712,bfThiqDd9FA,Not realistic...
11713,bfThiqDd9FA,was that supposed to be the 'sound of the impact' at the end of the video? O.o

11727,bfThiqDd9FA,A rock that size at that speed would explode the moon.
11728,bfThiqDd9FA,You would only be able to see it with a space telescope that’s orbiting the moon.
11729,bfThiqDd9FA,So many mistakes with physics........................oohhhh dear..................
11730,bfThiqDd9FA,Destroying nature

11735,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf is everyone here i love this..
11736,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s amazing how moon and the clouds move so much oblivious to each other’s presence and that dust cloud. Wow. Never knew it could go at 0.1 times the speed of light so easily
11737,bfThiqDd9FA,who can see moon in day?
11738,bfThiqDd9FA,Everyone on Earth.

11801,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you think the moon is in your backyard you can see everything.
11802,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks for a great morning laugh!
11803,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farted and this guy caught it in camera

11815,bfThiqDd9FA,I would like to see your property.  I already bought Brooklyn bridge a few years ago.  But I got no water property to put it over.

11834,bfThiqDd9FA,That's the moon farting.  It does that.
11835,bfThiqDd9FA,When did that happen? I didn't see anything on the local news about it? Looks like a horrible crash

11880,bfThiqDd9FA,Fail.
11881,bfThiqDd9FA,"Guys, you dont get it, that is a different Moon not Earth's Moon, thats why it looks unreal. This one looks exactly like ours but we know nothing about it, so all that could be entirely accurate.
As far as i know this ''Moon'' is called Luna..."
11882,bfThiqDd9FA,Luna is just the Spanish word for moon.
11883,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice special effects
11884,bfThiqDd9FA,Indians made this video
11885,bfThiqDd9FA,Einstein is trying to choke himself in heaven watching this
11886,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
11887,bfThiqDd9FA,"parece montaje de video o gráfico..  la explosión muy clara para ser en la luna, hay algo raro!"
11888,bfThiqDd9FA,See! Because of the lower gravity of the moon (1.62m/s2).....the dust leaves her atmosphere immediately or she left the dust.
11889,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the debris cloud doesn’t have a shadow.
11890,bfThiqDd9FA,And it just being in a lower frame rate than the rest of the video.
11891,bfThiqDd9FA,Click bait😂

11904,bfThiqDd9FA,Ja klaaar 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11905,bfThiqDd9FA,No atmosphere on moon so no distortion of the plume as depicted.  Also the magnitude of the explosion would be astronomical (no pun intended) to make it visible.  Someone has failed to to simple math before making this charade video.
11906,bfThiqDd9FA,This is whats wrong with the world! that so many people cant tell that this video is fiction
11907,bfThiqDd9FA,Mavattelapjanterculooo ooo
11908,bfThiqDd9FA,"bruh, why the fps of the crash dosnt match the videos fps😂
Not gona start to talk about physiks tho...."
11909,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon farted
11910,bfThiqDd9FA,"Incredible...

*¡ 𝗜ᴛ's ᴀ 𝗠ᴏᴏɴ's 𝗙ᴀʀᴛ !* 👏🏻"
11911,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂🎉
11912,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is definitely in our firmament
11913,bfThiqDd9FA,Umm moon are see in day ??
11914,bfThiqDd9FA,wow le montage
11915,bfThiqDd9FA,Wait.. did… the moon just shart?
11916,bfThiqDd9FA,"Funny how the explosion looks like a bad gif, with 6 frames per second."
11917,bfThiqDd9FA,"Every single comment in here starts with ""I love"""

11921,bfThiqDd9FA,"remember kids, on the moon there are constant 10fps"
11922,bfThiqDd9FA,The ejecta would form a perfect half sphere.
11923,bfThiqDd9FA,funny - but so many things are so wrong with this. Not done by a physicist...
11924,bfThiqDd9FA,"Now for the other BS .... how every post starts with ''I LOVE HOW"""""
11925,bfThiqDd9FA,I always ask “why would someone have a camera pointing at that?” It’s easier to spot the bullshit that way.
11926,bfThiqDd9FA,Did we witness a moon do a massive fart in space?
11927,bfThiqDd9FA,Look rite below it there a little black thing looks like it pulling it
11928,bfThiqDd9FA,Are we sure that came from are planet
11929,bfThiqDd9FA,Dude what?
11930,bfThiqDd9FA,"Simply look at other videos on this channel and you know what you have to know. I just say: ""How to make popcorn with six smartphones using 5G""

11931,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone is leaving funny ""I love how.."" comments 😂"
11932,bfThiqDd9FA,that rocket is roughly 350 miles long.
11933,bfThiqDd9FA,I think its getting closer to the earth
11934,bfThiqDd9FA,The web is completely full of bullshit these days and is getting worse
11935,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😅😅😅😅😅
11936,bfThiqDd9FA,"Can everyone stop starting their comments with ""I love""? It's creeping me out"
11937,bfThiqDd9FA,"Faked. 1: The moon is a quarter of a million miles away, a dot traveling that fast is going about the speed of New Horizons. 2. The mushroom cloud can only be made if there's an atmosphere. 3. A dot that big is about the size of your mom"
11938,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
11939,bfThiqDd9FA,AI is really cool
11940,bfThiqDd9FA,9.4 million views. Imagine the paycheck this loser got from Youtube.
11941,bfThiqDd9FA,So that's why moon is important to Earth. It helps Earth to withstand the annihilation stone.
11942,bfThiqDd9FA,why does this pathetic video even exist
11943,bfThiqDd9FA,What a crock.
11944,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why is my bullshit meter going off?
...
Man is it ever going off! This guy who puked up this bit of fakery needs to go back to computer arts class.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
11945,bfThiqDd9FA,Horrible 😂😂
11946,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahaa
11947,bfThiqDd9FA,a lot of love in these comments.

11953,bfThiqDd9FA,Dude the sheer scale is so out of proportion it’s fucking insulting
11954,bfThiqDd9FA,"It is false, the moon does not have an atmosphere for an explosion to behave that way."
11955,bfThiqDd9FA,The only thing missing was explosion sound on impact xD
11956,bfThiqDd9FA,"And the award for Best Comment goes out to:

CONGRATULATIONS!!!"
11957,bfThiqDd9FA,"What garbage! What was this filmed with?? If you say a phone..then it takes a good pic of something several hundred thousand kilometres away. If it is a P1000, which I have one. (Then why not zoom right in?) Then that plume must have been ginormous😅 
Honestly 🙄
With the moon diameter of, 3,474.8 km. Supposedly! Wake up!"

11964,bfThiqDd9FA,Can anyone tell me what's the name of bird in the background voice? I've been searching it.. but unable to find... 🥲
11965,bfThiqDd9FA,"its impossible bc, in space there no oxygen to make smokes :D"
11966,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait few days until it come to earth, we are all doomed 😱😱😱"
11967,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon has atmosphere now? Wow 😑
11968,bfThiqDd9FA,Can anyone identify that bird call?
11969,bfThiqDd9FA,Is it a scene of Looney Tunes?
11970,bfThiqDd9FA,"Como funciona a propulsão no vácuo? Alguém pode explicar, por gentileza?"
11971,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how... Oh wait. I love reading how everyone has posted what they love about the video 😂
11972,bfThiqDd9FA,This is very cute. But an impact that big would flash as bright as the sun and there are no mushroom clouds in the vacuum of space or on the moon. The ejecta go out in a cone shape and keep going. It's the earth's stratosphere that cause mushroom clouds. No air on the moon. But very creative anyway.
11973,bfThiqDd9FA,Believe me when I tell you? There's nothing unintentional about that. They really think we are stupid.
11974,bfThiqDd9FA,Um no atmosphere? Please again. A lot harder would be much appreciated. Thanks
11975,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't know the fps drops on the moon.

11987,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon fart😅
11988,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought in the day light you only saw a reflection of the Moon in the sky! So is the object hitting the Moon also the reflection of the impact! 😂
11989,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is a hollow cheese 🔔
11990,bfThiqDd9FA,Its on CNN
11991,bfThiqDd9FA,Too far to see a rocket 🚀 no matter the lens

12014,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone love’s howing things.
12015,bfThiqDd9FA,This is fkae the moon isnt that big and it's like 3Pm!
12016,bfThiqDd9FA,"i believe its a HOAX, good graphic design though very realistic thank you for the shockwave"
12017,bfThiqDd9FA,Well that’s a whole bunch of bullshit
12018,bfThiqDd9FA,"On another note, I watched a chemtrail plane fly behind the moon in the middle of the day, believe it or not."
12019,bfThiqDd9FA,On things that never happen.
12020,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the time saitama goes to the moon
12021,bfThiqDd9FA,Es una flatulencia de la luna
12022,bfThiqDd9FA,"yeah you would not see a cloud like that from an impact on the moon, second the moon is an alien space station so that will never happen"
12023,bfThiqDd9FA,How  big does the object should be to be seen like this?
12024,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is pretty funny. Someone worked very hard on the object's flight to the moon, but when it came to the cloud from crashing it looks like a very slow still frame video. L0L nice try."
12025,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the comments are
12026,bfThiqDd9FA,Hilarious

12031,bfThiqDd9FA,Disneyland would believe it. 😅😅
12032,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's right, folks, the moon is only 4,000' above our heads."
12033,bfThiqDd9FA,Clickbait...
12034,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember the ground shaking and the sunlight dimming precisely on that date.  Interesting!

12043,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂 that's how I feel about this video.
12044,bfThiqDd9FA,Hilariously defying the laws of physics.  🤣
12045,bfThiqDd9FA,Incredible … I always said ufo is in area 51 with interstellar for independence day therefore alien versus ET wins predator. I mean the fact of being deep impact with motorcycle on the hill will just be a supernova and not more.
12046,bfThiqDd9FA,"I knew the moon was hanging around in our atmosphere above the clouds and not in some crazy fantasy area, the so called ""space""."
12047,bfThiqDd9FA,damn bro everyone forgot about 11/9 💀
12048,bfThiqDd9FA,bs

12051,bfThiqDd9FA,Must be a big rocket to be able to create a mushroom cloud the size of Australia....
12052,bfThiqDd9FA,Farz....
12053,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon cannot crash into anything. It is not made of any solid physical matter. It is just a light reflection of the earth. The light parts of the moon show the oceans and bodies of water on the earth. And the darker areas of the moon are reflections of land masses on the earth.
12054,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
12055,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦‍♂️
12056,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how once in about 1000 orders McD's gives you an extra nugget.
12057,bfThiqDd9FA,Because on 999 orders they put one nugget less
12058,bfThiqDd9FA,That's voyeger 1😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😰😰😰
12059,bfThiqDd9FA,The object read ACME.

12062,bfThiqDd9FA,"Dammit, Wile E. Coyote..."
12063,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s a reasonably cool video. 
Issues were:
What hit the moon had to have been massive
The explosion happened on the exact edge of the moon as it faces Earth. Highly unlikely 
The explosion seemed to stop at one point
The explosion used follows the laws of gravity, sonething sorely lacking on the moon
The explosion seemed to have a left hand bias: that wouldn’t happen without a more angled approach or wind
That start and cut off points are exactly what we’d expect from someone creating an explosion video

Still, it was good enough that (worryingly) a number of people thought it genuine 

If it’s an early start into sievial FX, then well done - same if you were just pissing about - I know I don’t have the skills, ability or even patience to do better"
12064,bfThiqDd9FA,Nuclear moment:

12080,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you all love to write these comments ❤️‍🔥 thank you peeps
12081,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the frame rate of the crash (6 fps) is different from that of the rest of the video (30 fps). I wish the moon understood frame rates.
12082,bfThiqDd9FA,"their ain't  no way that rocket is so big that we can see it 238,900 miles away"
12083,bfThiqDd9FA,You wouldn't see something in space hurling towards the moon during daylight......just saying
12084,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is 3.5k km in diameter btw
12085,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is the worst
You need to take this down immediately
The explosion frame are DONT even match the frame rate of the video 👎"

12106,bfThiqDd9FA,Chandrayaan 2 crash footage
12107,bfThiqDd9FA,If this Clip is Real than thats got to mean that if a Rocket were ever to hit earth it could destroy a country because how would we be able to see that from a far long distance.
12108,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember my first in make believe too.
12109,bfThiqDd9FA,Wait thats my birthday-
12110,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted 👍
12111,bfThiqDd9FA,Although minimal...the clouds are lit differently to the moon.
12112,bfThiqDd9FA,I miss the shadow under the cloud. And yes... there would be one in that case!
12113,bfThiqDd9FA,Nukes and gas bombs make mushroom clouds on earth before the fuel ignites and has a reactor to the atmosphere pushing against it.. you wouldn’t get a mushroom cloud in space.. for a couple reasons but mostly because there’s no atmosphere.. if you detonate a nuke in space I’m pretty sure the warhead that cracks the part that holds the nuclear fuel is the only thing that would go off.. an that’s assuming it has an oxidizer in whatever it’s igniter is.. the nuclear part of the bomb wouldn’t even go off in space.
12114,bfThiqDd9FA,Check out the description... I didn't realize you could pile bullshit that high.
12115,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how everybody loves something in the video
12116,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments start with “I love” 😂

12124,bfThiqDd9FA,"I’m surprised Fox News did not do a 2 week long expose on this event with “Experts”, alternative angles and how this is all the Biden Administration’s fault <wink, wink>. 😂"
12125,bfThiqDd9FA,Im suprised our great attentive lord and savior biden is letting his country be invaded especially after seeing him unfreeze $6 billion for a trade swap when 2 of the iranian people we had didnt even want to go back. It just so happens shortly after that a terrorist group that iran heavily backs are  slaying innocent people. Its baffling to me that people still support a president who treats his citizens like shit
12126,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon just farted
12127,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah! Deixa eu filmar a Lua aqui pra ver se acontece alguma coisa.. 


Oh!  Aconteceu.. caiu alguma coisa ali.. agora eu se consagro..."

12136,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud acted like there was an atmosphere on the moon.
12137,bfThiqDd9FA,kind of like when we see sparks of the lunar module leaving the moon (supposedly)---- sparks wouldn't happen in a vacuum.
12138,bfThiqDd9FA,it would if air was released too.

​@@PJL-e9x"
12140,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@user-pn6vv3dw9w You can absolutely have sparks in space. If an object the size of the one in the video hit the moon, you'd actually see a really bright flash from the kinetic energy of the impact to boot. It's regular fire that isn't a thing, and sparks don't require oxygen or an atmosphere to occur. (Though you can still produce what's essentially chemical fire of sorts like with hypergolic fuels, where one of the components acts as the oxidizing agent.)"

12142,bfThiqDd9FA,@@PJL-e9x Sparks require neither oxygen or an atmosphere to happen. You're thinking of fire.

12151,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust travelled at some tens of thousands of miles per hour for a little bit... very realistic
12152,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactly my first thought :D
12153,bfThiqDd9FA,"And it even sent sound waves to earth, through zero atmosphere"
12154,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how blue the sky is, you can almost see the moon here."
12155,bfThiqDd9FA,"Thays a lot of "" I love "" at the start of most of the replies"
12156,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦🏻‍♂️
12157,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon is only hundreds of feet away! too
12158,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❗
12159,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is ginormous compared to at night! Gorgeous
12160,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
12161,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Biden told those journalists that his butt was wiped and ready to get kissed.
12162,bfThiqDd9FA,The mushroom cloud needs more frames. It doesn't match with the clouds in the sky.
12163,bfThiqDd9FA,Fack 🤦
12164,bfThiqDd9FA,It's so original 😅
12165,bfThiqDd9FA,damn that rocket is MONOLITHIC in size! the fact that you can even see it FROM EARTH as it HIT THE MOON is wild and that dust cloud was like THOUSANDS of MILES in size minimum. also the fact the the explosion RISES as the gases expand and the smoke being lighter than the AIR around it....just like it was an atmosphere....very cool space footage. accurate.
12166,bfThiqDd9FA,what's monolithic in size?  Just means one single part.
12167,bfThiqDd9FA,"that was made by NASA so when Indians go to try to find the landing site, they say it have been wiped out by that asteroid and here is the evidence now GIVE ME YOUR TAX MONEY AND SHUT UP."
12168,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the bird ever are chirping ""bullshit"""

12170,bfThiqDd9FA,Ça c'est passé quand
12171,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
12172,bfThiqDd9FA,These videos are the reason why people have very seperate opinions on astronomy such as the shape of the earth and all
12173,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how each comment starts from I love how.
12174,bfThiqDd9FA,Is it the clouds or the moon fell out of place
12175,bfThiqDd9FA,I had to click so i could see how perfect timing recording the moon during the day was
12176,bfThiqDd9FA,An explosion that colossal where the lunar dust actually fly into space would move the moon off its trajectory. Rubbish video
12177,bfThiqDd9FA,it seems like the moon just smoked a weed.
12178,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
12179,bfThiqDd9FA,Lucky this canera happened to be locked in on the moon in not such a cinematic kind of way.
12180,bfThiqDd9FA,This is so dumb!
12181,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems to the the dust from the collision would go out more to the sides
12182,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farting ..😂😂
12183,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon proteckt earth from meteors
12184,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣😂🤣😂
12185,bfThiqDd9FA,B.S.  The missle is way out of proportion.
12186,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon blew gases
12187,bfThiqDd9FA,"You know...if i would have done this, i would've also added the Fart with reverb sound efect, cause this is actually shit."

12193,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every one loves how
12194,bfThiqDd9FA,Artifical Intel
12195,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yep ... i mean nope ... no atmosphere, no cloud, no smoke 
Not even a fart"
12196,bfThiqDd9FA,I ❤TO ❤ 😘
12197,bfThiqDd9FA,"Is this the ""i love""comment section?"
12198,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty sure we'd be ducking for cover for a while after a collision of that magnitude
12199,bfThiqDd9FA,This isnt even well made
12200,bfThiqDd9FA,"Que suerte que estuvo todo el día grabando la luna esperando a que algo se impactará en ella. Una en un millón, ni la NASA es tan precisa"

12204,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love you
12205,bfThiqDd9FA,Ok ok I get you… love how this love how that 😂
12206,bfThiqDd9FA,Der einschlag war zum glück auf der dunklen Seite😂😂😂
12207,bfThiqDd9FA,"Sloppy work.  If you are faking something, do some basic research.

The moon was a 5% crescent on March 4, 2022.  Mushroom clouds do not form in a vacuum."
12208,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow that looks so cool
12209,bfThiqDd9FA,"I want that thing, that moon is smoking 👀😂"
12210,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

12214,bfThiqDd9FA,Es saitama? 😂
12215,bfThiqDd9FA,"bullshit, it would be imposssble to see the craft."
12216,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone starts their comments with” I love how” …idiots.
12217,bfThiqDd9FA,Whats with the “I love” comments 😂
12218,bfThiqDd9FA,Cars of transformers is size of gaint!  So Jupiter has moons size of Gaint!
12219,bfThiqDd9FA,😮
12220,bfThiqDd9FA,Just stupid. Good grief
12221,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon saved us again ...
12222,bfThiqDd9FA,If he or she or what the fuck is stupid and we know it clap your hands. CLAP CLAP
12223,bfThiqDd9FA,a big lie
12224,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon's farting
12225,bfThiqDd9FA,"90% of the people start by saying
“I love how..”"
12226,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
12227,bfThiqDd9FA,"Please note that Moon has no atmosphere, the dynamics of that huge debris cloud should look very differently."
12228,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahaha bro put a dustcloud gif on the moon.
12229,bfThiqDd9FA,Its amazing what people can do with Ai now.
12230,bfThiqDd9FA,e.i. some smaller space rocks hits on moon surface or aliens making a home with it.
12231,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moons out but it’s daytime and I hear birds.
12232,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon is so much further away than that
12233,bfThiqDd9FA,Hogy merednél ki az agyhalott reklámjaidal eggyütt phuuuuuuuu
12234,bfThiqDd9FA,"Too soon, we're not dumb enough"
12235,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he knew when it was coming to record. But I need more information. 😂
12236,bfThiqDd9FA,Finally!!! I saw the MOON FART....now  i can die in peace.
12237,bfThiqDd9FA,"A rocket part ""careering"" around space just trying to land...a job l guess."
12238,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon is farting in no atmosphere, and the matter of fact fart doesn't show it's shape but gives pungent smell similarly nuclear bomb in sky emmits light but no clouds and fire are formed."
12239,bfThiqDd9FA,Фейк для баранов
12240,bfThiqDd9FA,Hows the moon out at this time of day?
12241,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon fart😂😂
12242,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks legit
12243,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
12244,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this happened during the day when the moon is not even visible
12245,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you ever get outside during the day? The moon is easily visible in the daytime several days per month. I can't believe you don't know this. You should have learned this in your 2nd grade science classes.
12246,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ValkyrieRiderIPT 
Or you could also have learned this in your ""curiously looking around at the world"" time. Perhaps in your childhood, teen years, or adulthood.

I once read a guy's story about his uncle thinking the world was coming to an end because the moon was visible during the day. Why on earth would you jump to that conclusion, without just talking to a couple of other people about it first?"
12247,bfThiqDd9FA,@@UTU49 You're backpeddling...is the Moon visible in the daytime several days per month?
12248,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@UTU49 *I once read a guy's story about his uncle thinking the world was coming to an end*

12255,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how most of these comments start with “I love how….”  Why is that?
12256,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes the Saitama

12317,bfThiqDd9FA,The moons just a reflection of earth 🤯

12319,bfThiqDd9FA,Can we talk about how large and how fast an object  seen from earth   View. That  sucker would  probably crack the moon
12320,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in morning  you kidding me
12321,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how basically every comment begins with ""I love""."

12326,bfThiqDd9FA,Just a beautiful full moon at noon. . .
12327,bfThiqDd9FA,"The framerate of the ""explosion"" is a little off, but the rest is just fine."

12331,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you're the only one to catch this on camera. Good job 😮
12332,bfThiqDd9FA,"yea clearly it is just magical how the dust from the impact, moves in >20fps while the video still is about 40-50fps, meanwhile the structure of the dustcloud behaves like on a heavyer atmosphere then we even have on our planet.

Bet no scientist could explain it"
12333,bfThiqDd9FA,"The mushroom cloud behaves, as if there is an atmossphere on the moon."
12334,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a Spy balloon farting
12335,bfThiqDd9FA,"That explosion was so powerful, reality could only process it at like 9 fps"
12336,bfThiqDd9FA,I SAW THAT SMALL THING
12337,bfThiqDd9FA,Nuclear bombs detected
12338,bfThiqDd9FA,A meteor hitting the moon?  Like it hasn't happened before?  It was only a matter of time until one was finally captured.
12339,bfThiqDd9FA,Impossible
12340,bfThiqDd9FA,That's why people stopped believing. Videos like this are helping shatter people's trust.
12341,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the supposed smoke from far away moves faster than the clouds up close
12342,bfThiqDd9FA,the impact cloud reacts as if there was air. They should just spread in a linear way
12343,bfThiqDd9FA,I see this live at that time
12344,bfThiqDd9FA,Lier is moon will come in morning lier
12345,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂
12346,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao.. This is so silly. To think that someone actually thought the impact cloud would be that big is funny. Like a 100 mega ton hydrogen bomb going off 🤣🤣
12347,bfThiqDd9FA,"I feel strongly about the way the dust cloud moved in the vacuum of space, but love scares me an I don't want to commit to anything right now so let's just be friends."
12348,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the comments start with exactly what they love about the video.
12349,bfThiqDd9FA,it's creepy
12350,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well, I'm convinced. I'm 4 by the way"
12351,bfThiqDd9FA,Götterdämmerung...!!!
12352,bfThiqDd9FA,"The immediate dust flowing with the  impact of the object in terms of distance is a big lie,the moon has no gravity thus will influence the visibility of the impact."
12353,bfThiqDd9FA,Some may scientists here 😂😂😂😂😅
12354,bfThiqDd9FA,"A lot of LOVE in this thread. Jeeze, “I love how…..” “I love when”, “ love how” a lot a Loves. Wired."

12357,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that he is making money with this scammy footage 😆
12358,bfThiqDd9FA,"The visuals are neat, but the explosion is happening way too quickly. The Moon is big, and the explosion seems to be sending out ejecta (in the shape of a mushroom cloud??) at some fraction of the speed of light which is pretty damn wonky."
12359,bfThiqDd9FA,"He got what he wonted, Views & Likes😅"
12360,bfThiqDd9FA,Warum hast du nicht gezoomt hää😡🙄
12361,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mhm. Could almost believe it. Just the last seconds, it kind of vaporize in a second🤔"
12362,bfThiqDd9FA,That's huge if trying to reorient BwonGgg! The lunar orbit to starve the entire world of its season or just crush one natio. Or free sea ice permanently. .  Going to need a little more than that week butch stimulus check and a couple twenty1 yr old twin bket list fugks to not have the jewditial system involved
12363,bfThiqDd9FA,So why the cloak and dagger about the math of the collision trajectory and what was the proposed effect or solution or was it to see if we could last time someone went solo or intandum lots of people lost their lives with the pandemic.  A bs culture of. Only child victimization media selling doritos and vag wipes .and everything else crazy ladies need running around like kids outside of a ninjaturtle movie

12377,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone ask the question if the moon is 100's of 1000's of miles away how do we see that. Stupid and crazy 🤪
12378,bfThiqDd9FA,That dust cloud would take 10 times longer to form... And it would be 10 times smaller

12418,bfThiqDd9FA,I love I love comments
12419,bfThiqDd9FA,this is why youtube is a dumb platform. It blindly promotes anything thats been viewed a lot and liked. This is how women's brain works and therefore youtube and women are the same😅
12420,bfThiqDd9FA,"OMG, RIP..
I can see aliens bodies in dust cloud.."
12421,bfThiqDd9FA,"Everyone talking about clouds and spaceships, but that moon is way too big 😂"

12440,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro what moon is out on the day
12441,bfThiqDd9FA,every moon.
12442,bfThiqDd9FA,فوتوشوب كذب في كذب
12443,bfThiqDd9FA,Now the moon is relived from its gastric issues
12444,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon looks so clear and big in your part of the world
12445,bfThiqDd9FA,"it is that clear sometimes, also you can crop the video so you can better see it in a video"
12446,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
12447,bfThiqDd9FA,é pá gd tnga
12448,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like moon is farting
12449,bfThiqDd9FA,"Finally a clear video of a clear incident involving the moon and  at exactly the right time to record it. 

I mean the odds of all of that are astronomical yet this person managed to pull it off.

I say bravo, baaahhhvo!!!"

12452,bfThiqDd9FA,This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
12453,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how big the moon is in broad daylight I also love how you can see the micro particles of space dust enter the…👀 mushroom cloud…in space…🤣🤣🤣
12454,bfThiqDd9FA,Deception is never appreciated
12455,bfThiqDd9FA,Ehm sulla luna non c'è atmosfera 😂
12456,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this comment section is going
12457,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cameraman just happened to be filming the moon for no apparent reason.
12458,bfThiqDd9FA,Ola irundhalum oru nyayam venama da
12459,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart 😂
12460,bfThiqDd9FA,Just a hint for your next attempt. There is only the thinnest of atmosphere on the moon. This means that the dust and debris from an impact would not look like a volcanic eruption cloud found on Earth.
12461,bfThiqDd9FA,"So we can see a rocket from over 200,000 miles away flying into the moon. BS…"
12462,bfThiqDd9FA,A mushroom cloud that big is perhaps even larger than that of Tsar bomba😂
12463,bfThiqDd9FA,"It just released one, chillax"
12464,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hmm, still cannot defeat the clip dragon in malaysia.. that one hilarious 😅"

12487,bfThiqDd9FA,"That rocket is probably the size of France, and the cloud moves at 6 times the speed of light at the moons atmosphere,  makes me belive the air in the moon just a bit thinner than earth😂😂😂😂.  Now that cloud is probably 130,000 miles high so we can see it with the naked eye from earth.  But with no expansive wave."
12488,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is visible in the morning 😂😂😂
12489,bfThiqDd9FA,"FPS of actual clouds and ""explosion cloud"" are different. GG for BB"
12490,bfThiqDd9FA,"pity the different frame rate, also the dot of the rocket does not have the tracker the recovery fluctuates but the rocket goes straight away as if nothing had happened. It could have been done a little better."
12491,bfThiqDd9FA,It's Moon Fart 😢
12492,bfThiqDd9FA,Lame joke...

12502,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon let out a fart
12503,bfThiqDd9FA,Fek videos
12504,bfThiqDd9FA,Surprised they didn't add the impact sound as well. Total BS

Give this  creator some likes for the effort"
12526,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon is farting.
12527,bfThiqDd9FA,It took an hour for the sound to hit earth WOW!
12528,bfThiqDd9FA,That crushing looked like in a cartoon.
12529,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody loves how many times they can say i love how
12530,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣
12531,bfThiqDd9FA,I see a lot of losers making Trump comments when this stupid video has nothing to do with him. Get him out of your heads weak minded fools.
12532,bfThiqDd9FA,Me parece falso Rick
12533,bfThiqDd9FA,I love him cuz made brillant graphics 🤣🔥👍
12534,bfThiqDd9FA,If you see the moon u will notice it has a clear mouth with eyes and nose
12535,bfThiqDd9FA,So natural......
12536,bfThiqDd9FA,Most certainly the work of the Mooninites
12537,bfThiqDd9FA,even nuke explosion isn't big as that compared to the size of the moon.
12538,bfThiqDd9FA,"We asian think that Europeans are very much responsible to convey any news , but now i realize that i was wrong ,"
12539,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well, at least they didn’t just do that for Clicks  or anything"
12540,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon crash😂that was brain crash
12541,bfThiqDd9FA,An explosion this big. Ould have cut the moon in half 😅
12542,bfThiqDd9FA,You should hve definitely played the lottery that day
12543,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see the moon bigger than it’s ever been in broad daylight
12544,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how we’ve lost touch with truth. Trying to trick people into believing this kind of shit is unhinging the world. We no longer have  arbiters of truth. It’s like the late 19th century again with snake oil salesmen.
12545,bfThiqDd9FA,La luna flop dei ruxxi 😂😂🎉🎉
12546,bfThiqDd9FA,i am wodering why all comments started with I love🤔

Astronaut 2: But Jake...we are in USA, so we have to speed up.
Astronaut 1: OH WAIT WAIT WAI- *explosion.mp4*"
12556,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why the camera person is no astonished... Not  a single ""wow"" or sign of panic... How brave he/she is..."
12557,bfThiqDd9FA,dont you just love that
12558,bfThiqDd9FA,Pure bullshit 🤦‍♂️
12559,bfThiqDd9FA,Here's a theory: if they was exploring or probing guys moons well it wouldnt be most of this stifled cloistered moon and mushroom B.S.
12560,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this explosion with a 10 fps
12561,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit I've ever watched 😂
12562,bfThiqDd9FA,Phony as f**k!
12563,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that the cameraman is so quiet that you can hear his inner turmoil about what implications this impact could have on Earth's oceans.
12564,bfThiqDd9FA,"It would have zero impact, Mr. Pseudointellectual."
12565,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@aodigital9421ok but would you not be concerned 💀

12570,bfThiqDd9FA,what a useless video...
12571,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted!!
12572,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody and the comments using the word love ❣️ we all need it 🙏🏽

Damn"

12586,bfThiqDd9FA,...😂😂😂
12587,bfThiqDd9FA,Plume photogenesis is all wrong plus debris wouldn't spread like that in near 0 gravity.
12588,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the Moon has grown in size
12589,bfThiqDd9FA,Camera man knows everything in advance 💀
12590,bfThiqDd9FA,This video should be the litmas test for if people can use the internet
12591,bfThiqDd9FA,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.   i didn't know that the moon was running on a diffrent frame rate then the earth.
12592,bfThiqDd9FA,Myeahhhh...

12594,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just hit the vape hard

12596,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon is actually much closer than we thought. It's only a little higher up than the top of Mt. Everest...
12597,bfThiqDd9FA,i pray for any Clangers that were affected in this sad event
12598,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that Saitama vs Boros

12600,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I was late to the party again
12601,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is immediately thousands of miles tall and how you can hear the impact immediately even though it would take about 13 day for sound to reach earth.
12602,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Anddapizzaplease Irrelevant to the comment.  I’m talking about speed, not about whether or not it would actually get here."
12603,bfThiqDd9FA,@@williamk9881The speed of sound is dependent on the medium it travels though. Sound won't travel through space so it's a very relevant comment.
12604,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@adobepoopscript it's an unnecessary comment to those that know there's no sound in space already, which should be about ALL of us by now. The point that it would take 13 days for sound from the moon to reach us is a more tantamount statement."
12605,bfThiqDd9FA,And sound can't travel through the vacuum of space.

12608,bfThiqDd9FA,"PS: Sound waves need air to transmit in, no air, no sound ?"
12609,bfThiqDd9FA,There would be no sound transmission even within the environs of the moon...NO ATMOSPHERE TO TRANSMIT SOUND!
12610,bfThiqDd9FA,Unless the moons proximity to earth was always a lie.
12611,bfThiqDd9FA,@@williamk9881not really irrelevant that there wouldn’t be sound at all if your point is that the sound design is unrealistic

12619,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@spiracythegreat5386some of us don't believe the gayness
12620,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it's not even possible for an explotion in space to be heard from Earth
12621,bfThiqDd9FA,how would you hear the sound instantly??????????
12622,bfThiqDd9FA,I call it bullshit if you detonate small nuke on the moon it would be bearly visible from that distance. Flash maybe so kinetic energy from some small piece woudlnt be able to cause such big explotion plut theres vacume in space so no mushroom cloud but come like structure. All just my guess might be wrong but I think Im not.hehe
12623,bfThiqDd9FA,I f**k all these 'i love' comments
12624,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves something about this video 😂

12626,bfThiqDd9FA,Hey that was cool... I must have been out of it... Missed that one... Cool though..👍👻
12627,bfThiqDd9FA,How can you see moon in the morning?
12628,bfThiqDd9FA,That mushroom cloud is literally the size of a country and the rocket is like the size of an entire city
12629,bfThiqDd9FA,I love ya'll.
12630,bfThiqDd9FA,Finally I got Radahn…
12631,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how this moon is almost full, but the day the rocket actually struck the moon, it was a waning crescent. Time travel I'll bet is the reason."
12632,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the moment of impact is like 10fps👍
12633,bfThiqDd9FA,"ahhh, the  ""you always see a laggy hundred thousand kilometres big and with lightning speed expanding steam cloud in non existant airspace if a rocket part that is of course bright as the sun hits the moon, just 300 thousand kilometres away, showing the impact directly parallel to our point of view.""


 it happens all day."
12634,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact didn't make the moon fall out of the sky and crush us all

12640,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂
12641,bfThiqDd9FA,Excellent but prank.
12642,bfThiqDd9FA,"La luna non si trova nella nostra atmosfera, ergo la polvere sollevata non la vedremmo così se si potesse davvero vedere. Inoltre per essere così visibile sapete a quanti metri si deve essere sollevata dal suolo lunare?"
12643,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, I’m blown away in so many ways:

First, I didn’t know we could make such huge rockets! Given the diameter of the moon is 2,159 miles, that means that rocket part is approximately 45 miles big - imagine how big the whole rocket must have been - at least a couple of hundred miles big!

Second, it took about 3.9 seconds for that rocket part to travel the diameter of the moon (2,159 miles). From the equation Speed = Distance/Time, that 45 mile wide rocket part was traveling at approximately 1,977,710 miles per hour. Guys - this means we have the technology to get to Mars in less time than it takes to fly to Paris from New York!! Why are they hiding this from us?!

Third, this is definitive proof that we’ve been lied to about the moon not having an atmosphere - just look at that mushroom cloud! Not only that, but given how high the cloud went it’s proof that the moon’s atmosphere is about 8 times thicker than the Earth’s!

What else have they been lying to us about - maybe the earth IS flat after all?!"
12644,bfThiqDd9FA,😂

12658,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, the Earth is flat and you've been had as a complete sucker"
12659,bfThiqDd9FA,The guy posting this doesnt give a crap. He just enjoys the money youtube pays him for his millions of views
12660,bfThiqDd9FA,I’ve never really thought about it like that before you mite be right!
12661,bfThiqDd9FA,most definitely the earth is flat and most definitely we did NOT land on the moon. the moon is a light not a rock.
12662,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ChristinaSiddorn-z8w i agree the flat earth SOCIETY is PSYOP for it was started in order to mock, criticize and shame those who were legit speaking out the truth about the biblical cosmology of the earth. But remember the people who suddenly turned from the heliocentric model went to the same schools and were taught the same things as everyone else - that the earth is a globe flying thro space around the sun. The flat earth was a new conversation that really didnt begin until 2015. 
Why was that? 
Its because we are nearing the end of this era of time and the bible says that all mysteries and deceptions will be revealed.

Just look at how much we know now that we did not know even 8 years ago. this is the reason why. God is unveiling all the hidden things that are mysteries of the earth as well as the things hidden by the lies of the elite establishment.
Now we know the world is run by a secret kabal of satan worshipping elites
Now we know why all those children on milk cartons have been missing for 50 years!!!! and where they Wentworth.
Now we know why places like DisneyWorld exist. 
Now we know that Hollywood is a group of perverted, INVERTED psycho satan worshippers.
Now we know that the majority of Hollywood actors are the opposite sex as they present.  

now we know the symbols that Hollywood flashes across all tv shows are an occult hidden language, what they mean and that they are part of the hidden secret satan worship.  We did not know anything about these things even in 2014.
Now we know that all the Apollo missions were a lie and no one has been to the moon. 
now we know the sun is not 93 million miles away.
Now we know that everything we have been taught in school is a lie. The earth is flat. the sun and moon are the same size and run on the same track inside the dome of earth. 
now we know there are other lands beyond what we have been told
Now we know why Antarctica has been protected by a world wide treaty to keep people OUT OF THE TRUTH
Now we know that the elites have been dumbing us down and poisoning with toxic chemicals in our food, air and water.

these are just a few of the things we know now because God has removed the veil off mysteries and deception."

12684,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video gets 50k likes because that makes me feel smart

12694,bfThiqDd9FA,We have a really good vision for something that should be at 400 000 kms distance from us...
12695,bfThiqDd9FA,"How many ""LOVES"" in the comments section?🙄🙄"
12696,bfThiqDd9FA,How satisfying it would be to see the entire toilet that is the west coast flushed! 😊
12697,bfThiqDd9FA,That's no moon...it's a space station
12698,bfThiqDd9FA,I love pizza
12699,bfThiqDd9FA,these guys have been making stupid moon fakes for a while now. its a trend
12700,bfThiqDd9FA,Applausi per il cameraman
12701,bfThiqDd9FA,Jajaja 😅😂😂😂
12702,bfThiqDd9FA,I see that to but I'm in NM it hit the moon and was a cloud ☁️ so that just happened & the Skywalker incident too
12703,bfThiqDd9FA,"I wonder how big of a
Cater that left."
12704,bfThiqDd9FA,Is there ANY truth on the internet any more?  The sad thing about this phenomena is that when something big does happen nobody's going to even believe it.
12705,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama !
12706,bfThiqDd9FA,No ediot can belive this cheep vedio
12707,bfThiqDd9FA,Je suis choqué de voir un montage vidéo aussi simple faire autant de vue !! Demain je sort une vidéo comme ça 🤩🤩🤩
12708,bfThiqDd9FA,The fact that moon had messaged the cameraman before it could happen is something appreciable 🥴
12709,bfThiqDd9FA,The photographer who captured the last moon landing crew heading home made a landline call when he saw that rocket approaching. Dude's a legend.
12710,bfThiqDd9FA,Police chase in space.
12711,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg i had a dream like this except the moon exploded then hit the earth.
12712,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I love how"" that's it 🤣"
12713,bfThiqDd9FA,A decade of video footage just for this one clip

12719,bfThiqDd9FA,"😂я вот не успел записать падение метеорита даже тот момент когда мы его искали, в итоге нашли забрали только ядро а черные остатки брать не стали , так я его продаю но мне не верят что это метеорит. Говорят что гранитных метеоритов не бывает😂 будто они весь космос облетели те кто мне пишет и доказывают что там нет такого материала😂😂😂😂"
12720,bfThiqDd9FA,A moon's fart! 😱Watch out!
12721,bfThiqDd9FA,What a horrible comping job! Did anyone fall for this? 😂
12722,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone is commenting ""I love how"""
12723,bfThiqDd9FA,Realy
12724,bfThiqDd9FA,are they practicing the project Blue beam
12725,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone starts their comment off with, ""I love how..."""
12726,bfThiqDd9FA,feels kind of like dumping toxic waste into a garden or crashing a car into a bunch of sleeping ducks just to be a scumbag.
12727,bfThiqDd9FA,"No lo se rick 🤔, parece falso, es mejor hacerle zoom se puede apreciar que no forma parte del ambiente se ve muy raro 😅"
12728,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the way people sharing their comment, even when not needed. I am included there too...."
12729,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the moon formed a mushroom cloud even without an atomosphere.
12730,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a big spaceship
12731,bfThiqDd9FA,Why would the moon even be THAT bright in broad daylight.
12732,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that this vedio could reveal secrets
12733,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the birds are singing happily, completely oblivious to the expanding mushroom cloud up in the vacuum of space."
12734,bfThiqDd9FA,GODZILLA IS ATTACKING THE MOON! ARRRGGHHH
12735,bfThiqDd9FA,Would it not be in a V shape and much slower?
12736,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
12737,bfThiqDd9FA,😅
12738,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakkk
12739,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there is clearly audio but the person witnessing this event doesn't say a thing about it.
12740,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love.
12741,bfThiqDd9FA,Randomly filming the moon and this happens... unlikely
12742,bfThiqDd9FA,"Sorry, I was aiming for Mars"
12743,bfThiqDd9FA,Bhai moon to raat mein nikalta hai din mein thodi na😂
12744,bfThiqDd9FA,How did the cameraman know this would happen?
12745,bfThiqDd9FA,If an object that size impacted the moon it would split in half 😂 but it wont because the moon is an alien space station 😮
12746,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aww, I love video fakes!!!!"
12747,bfThiqDd9FA,i love the hyperrealistic camera shake
12748,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow! That is one of the coolest thing I ever seen for happen in the sky!
12749,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nasa why you hitting the moon wuth a rocket (nasa ) we want to see if it makes a noise 
(me)you mean your trying to find out if the moons hollow dont try and spin a yarn you muppets"
12750,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
12751,bfThiqDd9FA,How many are watching this vedio from 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 India
12752,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the moon was visibly shaken and emotionally affected by this tragic event
12753,bfThiqDd9FA,Cheese everywhere.
12754,bfThiqDd9FA,Weed Smokers could see this happening 😂
12755,bfThiqDd9FA,10κ comments here and everyone start as I love 😂😂😂😂😂 wtf guys ???
12756,bfThiqDd9FA,I  Love LAmp.   I love lamp....
12757,bfThiqDd9FA,This is day time how the moon come from nowwhere😂
12758,bfThiqDd9FA,What is love? Baby don’t hurt me.
12759,bfThiqDd9FA,Even the birds are Chirping *BULLSHYT* 😂😭😭😂
12760,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does the cloud look like the Grinch touching the moon?
12761,bfThiqDd9FA,0:13 rocket hit moon
12762,bfThiqDd9FA,What did you do the effects with a zx81
12763,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Neil deGrasse Tyson isnt all over this shit right here
12764,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahh yes I like how we can see the impact so soook clearly when that object hit the moon
12765,bfThiqDd9FA,Oppenheimer shooting on moon
12766,bfThiqDd9FA,"Din Mein Kaun Sa Moon 
 Aata Hai"
12767,bfThiqDd9FA,🤔
12768,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farts
12769,bfThiqDd9FA,The fps of the explosion dropped.
12770,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice Graphic 👍
12771,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice render and video effect. Though the scaling of the smoke cloud should be improved.
Also the smoke cloud physics are wrong. There is no atmosphere to slow down the smoke expansion rate and the gravity too low for such a drastic slowdown. Thus the smoke should expand pretty much with the same speed and constantly getting bigger.
Inner turbulences in the smoke cloud are also wrong, again because of no air to cause such turbulences.
Then the problem of no fire. Even without atmosphere, such an impact would create considerable heat (molten material) which should be visible in a bright flash of light."
12772,bfThiqDd9FA,😁😁😁 Would be even better if there was a cow leaping over the Moon
12773,bfThiqDd9FA,that was actually saitama going back to earth after getting sent to the moon by boros
12774,bfThiqDd9FA,😱😱😱
12775,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahah what load of 🤬
12776,bfThiqDd9FA,Let the moon fart dude stop peaking you makin it nervous😂
12777,bfThiqDd9FA,Why dose ot look glichy
12778,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments
12779,bfThiqDd9FA,I would have love to hear some noise as well😅
12780,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest clip ever😊
12781,bfThiqDd9FA,i crashed on the moon once... stopped drinking soon after..
12782,bfThiqDd9FA,"Without an atmosphere, there wouldn't be a mushroom 😂"
12783,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how nearly every comment here starts with “I love how…” 😂

12785,bfThiqDd9FA,stop the cap
12786,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait, that's not mushroom, that's heart"
12787,bfThiqDd9FA,"The comments are the definition of followers.

WOW.

Look at the first three words of every comment."
12788,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂

12793,bfThiqDd9FA,if I write I love does youtube put that at the top of its algorithm...I love myself and I love money greed and corruption so much I would give it ALL away
12794,bfThiqDd9FA,Great footage! If only the Moon really had an atmosphere...
12795,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the part where the moon said, “Draw me like one of your French girls.”"
12796,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
12797,bfThiqDd9FA,something this big and historical never made the news..but it is here on you tube...haha
12798,bfThiqDd9FA,Everything in this clip is very unnatural. That's not how the nature works there in the wilding
12799,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahah
12800,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I love how ... "" "
12801,bfThiqDd9FA,"9 identical round shaped planets orbiting the sun? life on only one and no life on the remaining eight? life on only one body in the entire space/universe?

a-> What if the Apollo 11 and other celestial missions was and is just too early considering our technological advancement?

b-> What if all bodies in & out our solar system just like the earth currently contains some sort of unobservable civilization?

c-> For centuries, we have observed the universe by stretching the capacity of our 5 senses; what if we can better observe the universe by creating an entirely different technological sense and only translate it's perception to the understanding of our 5 senses?

d-> We can perceive very little of the electromagnetic spectrum; What if the observability of civilizations in celestial bodies within and outside our solar system is frequency secured and can only be observed with technological senses that break the barriers of frequencies?

12805,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow amazing... moon can fart too !
12806,bfThiqDd9FA,I love hiw the video went from 480p to 4k
12807,bfThiqDd9FA,CLICKBAIT
12808,bfThiqDd9FA,Ai generated
12809,bfThiqDd9FA,I don’t know about you but don’t we all just film the moon just in case a random object that would totally be visible in the day lit sky would strike the moon? No flash? No? No one does that? And there was no news coverage at all? Huh?
12810,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted at a spec
12811,bfThiqDd9FA,😂The moon is dizzy
12812,bfThiqDd9FA,POOOOOOOOOT!!!!
12813,bfThiqDd9FA,I   LIKE the fact that there's so much love here
12814,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud💀💀
12815,bfThiqDd9FA,Such a tragedy😁
12816,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought the moon farted.
12817,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon was that close we wouldve been flooded💀
12818,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah yes. The cloud after the impact, cause that’s what happens"
12819,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud is probably coming off the moons surface at faster than the speed of light. Massive explosions look slow from far away.
12820,bfThiqDd9FA,"project bluebeam? would not be able to see this rocket and not only that the moon never looks like that in my sky, perfect as it was, especially during the day."
12821,bfThiqDd9FA,"it looks exceptionally close, unless it's zoomed and in that case how did this person know to film but guess it is possible"
12822,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s BS
12823,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves everything that shows how absolutely ridiculous this is.
12824,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how dumb this is 😂
12825,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is exceptionally closer than normal.
12826,bfThiqDd9FA,"I believe that phenomenon is officially named as a ""Bruce Almighty Moon."" 😂"
12827,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s not even a thing.  Never heard of a zoom lens?
12828,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this from a Loony Tunes Episode?
12829,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s cool, the impact was on the dark side of the moon… no one gives a crap about the stupid dark side of the moon. Serves them right for living in the dark side."
12830,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cats
12831,bfThiqDd9FA,Btw i was this irl and its onkt view notging crazy
12832,bfThiqDd9FA,first ever moon fart caught in camera!
12833,bfThiqDd9FA,Even frame rate different :))) very unrealistic
12834,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my truck. I don’t even like this video.
12835,bfThiqDd9FA,Please stop... you're freaking out the idiots
12836,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lmao, shame they didn't know more about physics, that dust would have taken weeks or months to settle, plus the impact/ plum wasn't lined up with the crafts trajectory upon impact to plum"
12837,bfThiqDd9FA,I love being a weirdo internet follower
12838,bfThiqDd9FA,Why was he filming the moon at that time
12839,bfThiqDd9FA,or she
12840,bfThiqDd9FA,O Bhai ye din mien Chand Kahan see nikala Aya🤣🤣
12841,bfThiqDd9FA,I love  how you  can observe that in the moon dust  moves at about 2 FPS
12842,bfThiqDd9FA,"HEY @YOUTUBE,  DO YOU HAVE TO PUT UPCOMING VIDEOS ON THE SCREEN AT THE END.    is it REALLY necessARY to block MOST of the screen with them ????"
12843,bfThiqDd9FA,"The rocket crashing into the moon search for the impact crater will be challenging and might take weeks to months 
The search for  the crater that had the impact left by the rocket crashing into it,  might take weeks or months to fully obtain all the info from it."
12844,bfThiqDd9FA,What the heck was that?🤔
12845,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon did not melt because it is clearly not cheese.
12846,bfThiqDd9FA,i love the moon
12847,bfThiqDd9FA,Leute seit ihr alle behindert was schreibt ihr alle am Anfang ich Liebe es was stimmt mit euch nicht
12848,bfThiqDd9FA,Huh?
12849,bfThiqDd9FA,"The problem is, that the moon only have 10 fps"
12850,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is made of cheese and not dust.
12851,bfThiqDd9FA,Cuando saitama fue enviado a la luna por Botos😮
12852,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments made me laugh. ❤😂
12853,bfThiqDd9FA,Yaaaaaaaaa😂 good one 😂😂😂
12854,bfThiqDd9FA,What nonsense...no way Moons inhabitants would allow such.  In color film all the moons craters suddenly all have glass/Crystal Domes also see lake's grasslands roads....could thus be why they didn't use colored film when it was available during the FIRST moon landing first pics of the moon from space.  Lots happening up there I dont want to know any more than I already know
12855,bfThiqDd9FA,Pure bullshit
12856,bfThiqDd9FA,I do not love how everyone loves everything on here😵‍💫
12857,bfThiqDd9FA,"Is the ""I love how"" thing another new meme I missed...or is everyone here a robot?"
12858,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is 🥰
12859,bfThiqDd9FA,コロ助なり
12860,bfThiqDd9FA,Based on what we been told.. the physics of the moon would not allow a plume of dust
12861,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how everybody's saying I like how😂😂how 😂😂
12862,bfThiqDd9FA,I love everything
12863,bfThiqDd9FA,Cazzata un montaggio fatto male
12864,bfThiqDd9FA,Overused shake camera fx....
12865,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this a wiggle expression??
12866,bfThiqDd9FA,I played games with better graphics that this bullshit
12867,bfThiqDd9FA,Even the bird laugh
12868,bfThiqDd9FA,I love potatoes and that came from my potato gun. Don’t feel bad about it.
12869,bfThiqDd9FA,Nevermind me I just thought I would join the rest of YouTube and say random nonsense.
12870,bfThiqDd9FA,A wave loudly clashing against a long shoreline doesn't like paying taxes.
12871,bfThiqDd9FA,Trickery is like a summer breeze.
12872,bfThiqDd9FA,"On March 4, 2022, the visible moon was a tiny sliver, not nearly full like in the video.  Try again."
12873,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bu bir montaj, ayda atmosfer yok ve patlama mantar şeklinde olmaz.
Ayrıca ay kadar uzak olan bir nesne bukadar belirgin görünmez."
12874,bfThiqDd9FA,Theres alot of love in this comment section
12875,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦
12876,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moin will never be this near to earth you god damn goofballs
12877,bfThiqDd9FA,I don’t love.
12878,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG! I am so scared!! Is that dust cloud going to shower the Earth with radiation?!?! I heard that the Moon is made of uranium and plutonium and that's where they get the stuff to make bombs!! From the Moon! This is such a frightening video! I just want to sit in my safe space and drink hot cocoa and listen to Britney Spears music and play Tiddlywinks!  I hope the moon creatures don't come down to Earth and invade us with their flying saucers and laser beams!! We are so terrible for hurting them!!
12879,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO!!! 🤣🤣🤣 I had to watch this just so I could comment.
12880,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't look up.
12881,bfThiqDd9FA,The explosion from the moon was so big that it lost frames rates
12882,bfThiqDd9FA,"something very... odd just occurred to me,   without knowing what the comment section looked like I had the urge to type ""I love how the effects are moving in 5fps compared to the rest of the video""   what kind of voodoo brain washing is this?"
12883,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to love
12884,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the birds are chirping, birds don’t chirp on Friday’s."
12885,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
12886,bfThiqDd9FA,I love nothing and nobody.
12887,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how people really consider it as a true event.
12888,bfThiqDd9FA,A
12889,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
12890,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO!
12891,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
12892,bfThiqDd9FA,"Don't you just ""Love it""!"
12893,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm not even a physicist and I know the velocities suggested in this video are ridiculous.
12894,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah typical clickbait fametuber bullshit..
12895,bfThiqDd9FA,"Just happened to be filming a full moon in the middle of the day, and captured the ever elusive moon mushroom cloud in the vacuum of space......"
12896,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the visibility of the moon in the middle of the day
12897,bfThiqDd9FA,"The video is a joke, of course, but the moon is regularly visible during the day."
12898,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12899,bfThiqDd9FA,Rocket shoul be 30km long according to scale)))
12900,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how
12901,bfThiqDd9FA,There's proof u f os can't drive
12902,bfThiqDd9FA,Whoever made this doesn't seem to understand scale. How small do they think the moon is?
12903,bfThiqDd9FA,Trust me bro.
12904,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
12905,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how why the fuck am i too writing out a comment
12906,bfThiqDd9FA,No light from blast😢
12907,bfThiqDd9FA,looney tunes dust cloud
12908,bfThiqDd9FA,should have included a sound effect
12909,bfThiqDd9FA,This is easliy the dumbest of the most dumb shit ive ever seen anyone try to lie about.
12910,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how who ever created this has minimal knowledge of how physics works
12911,bfThiqDd9FA,...whoever create this most certainly believed the 2023 Indian moon landing...and is most likely fully vaccinated.
12912,bfThiqDd9FA,"...heck, if you believe this moon crash video, you also believe in the Apollo landing no doubt."
12913,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@billyzee261bruh
12914,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp.
12915,bfThiqDd9FA,MOON IS POLASMA CHECK DOLLAR ERICK
12916,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how….. I dunno I just wanted to say it cause everyone else did
12917,bfThiqDd9FA,Bhai moon ke pichhe cloud ☁️ hoga
12918,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart 🌔💨
12919,bfThiqDd9FA,"I guess that's one way to get rid of the astronaut footprints, moon rover tracks, NASA equip, etc from the 60's & 70's.  No proof now that we actually walked on the moon... except for those moon-ray eels that attacked the cosmonauts on their fifteenth moon walk.  Next thing they'll find is the ARK that teleports people to Mars... or Uranus."
12920,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how all the comments are “i love how” 😂
12921,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon was puffin 😂
12922,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we love ❤️
12923,bfThiqDd9FA,smoke from the space bruhhhh 💀💀💀
12924,bfThiqDd9FA,At least there was no sound like most people.
12925,bfThiqDd9FA,This is proof the Moon is made of cheese
12926,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket hit the far side of the moon so yes this us bull shit
12927,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the fact that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will return to remove so many things that are just not of his will.
The whole world is passing away and you all are in for a battle for your life."
12928,bfThiqDd9FA,"I don't love anything about this video. The moons diameter is 2159 miles & the 'object' took 4 seconds from 1 diameter away to 'hit', meaning it was traveling at about 500 miles per second. The fireball created from an object maybe 50 miles long would be truly stunning & be the biggest story for many days. And with no atmosphere the jet would fly straight out, except for weak lunar gravity, not billow out."
12929,bfThiqDd9FA,So much love 😂
12930,bfThiqDd9FA,
12931,bfThiqDd9FA,"Could you imagine the size of that ""rocket"" to make that kind of impact😂 it would be like the grand canyon bull whipping the moon. Good movie quality effects though!"
12932,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkkkkkkkkkk
12933,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf is going on
12934,bfThiqDd9FA,"This will happen to us by 2028 if we do not address Climate Change NOW!  
This is an existential crises, donate to ActBlue to make your diverse voices herd."
12935,bfThiqDd9FA,Trash
12936,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love how love, loving love lovely"
12937,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon smokin some weed😂😂
12938,bfThiqDd9FA,This rocket is the size of Europe
12939,bfThiqDd9FA,"ah yes, that rocket was filled with 10 nuclear bombs."
12940,bfThiqDd9FA,"Besides the physics breaking explosion, that much of the moon would only be visible and illuminated at night. The moon is illuminated as it the sun is on the opposite side of the earth."
12941,bfThiqDd9FA,I DONT LOVE ANYTHING..
12942,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much I love my horses!
12943,bfThiqDd9FA,The moons craters are all different width but the same depth.
12944,bfThiqDd9FA,Name if song birds singing
12945,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp.
12946,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love carpet.

007"
12947,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farted
12948,bfThiqDd9FA,"*mom,dad look a bomb that ıs bıgger then the Tsar bomb hıttıng the moon!*

-10 year old kıd"
12949,bfThiqDd9FA,"that thing would have to be moving at about 1.8 million mph, faster than the speed of light"
12950,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds serenaded this event
12951,bfThiqDd9FA,moon recorded by 30fps but smoke by 15fps
12952,bfThiqDd9FA,The next meteor is going to split the moon in half causing Cosmic Destruction followed by Thundarr The Barbarian.
12953,bfThiqDd9FA,What
12954,bfThiqDd9FA,of meteore
12955,bfThiqDd9FA,47k actually tick the like
12956,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not bad special effects. Keep in mind the Moon is not a physical object, it is cold plasma energy."
12957,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
12958,bfThiqDd9FA,I love me some me...
12959,bfThiqDd9FA,civo à todos.😂
12960,bfThiqDd9FA,"Was that Stocktan Ruch's space capsule? As a very smart and capable aeronautical engineer, I been telling him from the start that thing is going to kill people"
12961,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aliens, i knew it"
12962,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hade, bisa kabeneran kitu nya"
12963,bfThiqDd9FA,This wouldn't happen because cheese isn't dusty.
12964,bfThiqDd9FA,"That ejecta would have to be traveling at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour (at least)

The impact that it would take to do something like that would shatter the whole moon into little bits."
12965,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how nearly everyone starts their comment with ""I love"""
12966,bfThiqDd9FA,"Great for dumb people, but there would be no cloud and then you also wouldn’t be able to see the damn thing unless it was a joint as a bus or a plane"
12967,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess at this speed impact flash would be bright as sun and crater would glow for days becoming lava ocean and there would be heavy meteor rain every month for 100 years
12968,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how
12969,bfThiqDd9FA,That moon or earth is moving a tad fast.😳
12970,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the way the birds sound . They sound at peace .
12971,bfThiqDd9FA,El fakola
12972,bfThiqDd9FA,"iPhone: Crash detection 
Samsung: Moon crash detection"
12973,bfThiqDd9FA,at least animate the impact with higher FPS :-)
12974,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hey, may I use this in my next SCI FI movie???"
12975,bfThiqDd9FA,"What sort of out-of-control text generator did ""write"" this description ?  🤦‍♂"
12976,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every response I've read thus far starts with ""I love""."
12977,bfThiqDd9FA,"xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
S H I T · GFX."
12978,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this man's video got 7.9 million views.....
12979,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
12980,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
12981,bfThiqDd9FA,Tarded.
12982,bfThiqDd9FA,Это лапша
12983,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is a lot closer than y'all think 😂😂😂
12984,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that bird singing
12985,bfThiqDd9FA,"stupidity is like sweet glue, and idiots that believe this kind of shyte are like flies."
12986,bfThiqDd9FA,Adding aftereffects to the video at 3fps 😂
12987,bfThiqDd9FA,This is done super badly. Was hoping for a nice effect. Why so many clicks ?
12988,bfThiqDd9FA,Ok that was worth the laugh i guess
12989,bfThiqDd9FA,huh 🤔
12990,bfThiqDd9FA,Bs
12991,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the bird was tweeting as if nothing significant was happening
12992,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my self
12993,bfThiqDd9FA,"I hate how we all people came here and make this video worth 47k likes, 9.9k comments and 7.8m views. All still counting. But I love the 129k dislikes..."
12994,bfThiqDd9FA,What happens on the moon stays on the moon.
12995,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is made of cheese.
12996,bfThiqDd9FA,I wasted 44 seconds watching this to do all the household chores and sleep again after that.
12997,bfThiqDd9FA,I like the fact that the cloud  was in the shape of a heart... nice touch..
12998,bfThiqDd9FA,Hated it. 🫰
12999,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm not happy the aliens died after their expectation to be well received on earth.
13000,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahha right! That’s like a 100x bigger than the Tsar Bomba explosion 😂😂
13001,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom cloud in space..... 🤔
13002,bfThiqDd9FA,Pagl hokiya
13003,bfThiqDd9FA,A lotta love in these comments
13004,bfThiqDd9FA,"Coincidence, recording the moon😅😂😂😂"
13005,bfThiqDd9FA,И вы всё пишите слово мне нравится!!!! Других слов нет?
13006,bfThiqDd9FA,"Вот читаю ваши комменты , с переводом, какой же всё-таки у вас узкий уровень разговора. Сильно не по рассуждаешь .... То ли наш русский язык. Можно описать это явление очень по разному. И только нам это будет понятно😊"
13007,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love bbq ribs. Like, a lot."
13008,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts with ""I love"" That plume of dust would have to be miles high in just a few seconds. And the moon is so far away it we don't see all the frames. ;) Space is so old is doesn't have HD unfortunately."
13009,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
13010,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my mom..
13011,bfThiqDd9FA,Could have been a metor
13012,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
13013,bfThiqDd9FA,This time on fact or cap I crash a spacship into the mood
13014,bfThiqDd9FA,Do u know who love me MY MOM
13015,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my husband is fron Nigeria and has a huge
13016,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the dust cloud moves at a different frame rate to the rest of the video
13017,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
13018,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is why you shouldn't never Drink and Drive, specially in Space."
13019,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh yes just casually recording the moon
13020,bfThiqDd9FA,As the tree from the video I can confirm hearing this
13021,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s a different frame rate that the video
13022,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦🏻
13023,bfThiqDd9FA,Bella Montegem 🤥🤥🤥
13024,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is your camera shaking so much :(
13025,bfThiqDd9FA,FAF
13026,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
13027,bfThiqDd9FA,Ну видно же что это монтаж.. .и кто на это ведется ...
13028,bfThiqDd9FA,"Dust clouds and heat convection don't behave that way in low/zero gravity... Especially not after an interstellar impact. And if you want to make a name for yourself as a 3D visuals artist, render at a consistent framerate..."
13029,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how?
13030,bfThiqDd9FA,"I mean, it looked cool."
13031,bfThiqDd9FA,So many lovely comments
13032,bfThiqDd9FA,So? I know if it's. Supposed? To. Look? Like. A? Mushroom cloud. But if that did happen there would be a big dust cloud but the dust cloud would not evaporate. It would just stay there and slowly spread out it space not earth
13033,bfThiqDd9FA,no
13034,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
13035,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cake.
13036,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does every comment here have love how in it? Can you people stop doing monkey see monkey do. So dumb.
13037,bfThiqDd9FA,I love technology 😂
13038,bfThiqDd9FA,Does moon have the gravity to attract the material
13039,bfThiqDd9FA,"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.” And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day. Then God said, “Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.” And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens. God called the space “sky.” And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.
Genesis 1:1‭-‬8"
13040,bfThiqDd9FA,you just lost a subscriber with this click bait bullshit shit 😂
13041,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
13042,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
13043,bfThiqDd9FA,I love myself and you should love yourself too.
13044,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks ai for ruining everything 😂
13045,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there is no reaction from the cameraman like it's just a natural occurrence
13046,bfThiqDd9FA,It's saitama
13047,bfThiqDd9FA,The best part is some how the moon grew an atmosphere. Do you think it hit one of those space ships that land there every week?
13048,bfThiqDd9FA,I would've been totally convinced this video was a joke if it wasn't for the description
13049,bfThiqDd9FA,Rockets don't move that fast...
13050,bfThiqDd9FA,He knew the exact timing of hit. Thanks to Machine learning. Oh God save the world.
13051,bfThiqDd9FA,"Es falso, se disipa muy rápido la nube de humo"
13052,bfThiqDd9FA,It's definitely entertaining! 😂😂😂
13053,bfThiqDd9FA,"I dont even care about the video, I've spent more time LoVEing this unhinged comment section. 💀"
13054,bfThiqDd9FA,"I Love the frame drop directly after impact and the clouds went so fast.
If this really happen the clouds would take hours before you can’t see them anymore."
13055,bfThiqDd9FA,Npc
13056,bfThiqDd9FA,@@thehighpugilist2 Discover a new word bud?
13057,bfThiqDd9FA,the FPS of the dust is like 15 or so meanwhile the clouds move in 30 XD
13058,bfThiqDd9FA,ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
13059,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkkk
13060,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
13061,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yep, the speed of the mushroom cloud was so ridiculously funny.  Whoever made this did not understand the aspect of scale.  It would take minutes if not an hour or more to eject material what appears to be at least 500 miles high and probably 500 miles wide."
13062,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it🥰
13063,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you start all your fckn comments with ""I love how... ""  motherfckrs"
13064,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love
13065,bfThiqDd9FA,"You’ve got to give it to him. As of June 2023, 7.8 million hits. This is what I call a very successful ‘click-bait’."
13066,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is flat
13067,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
13068,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the next video in the queue covers up the explosion halfway through.
13069,bfThiqDd9FA,"OMG , it's HIT N RUN CASE..."
13070,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you plastered your channel profile pic and  a video link over the video. Nothing like obscuring every ones view of video.
13071,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts with ""I love how""!"
13072,bfThiqDd9FA,I Hate love
13073,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love...
13074,bfThiqDd9FA,So bad ass
13075,bfThiqDd9FA,"If the moon is a quarter the size of earth, that explosion would be so frickng massive."
13076,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how..... ah sod it
13077,bfThiqDd9FA,You’re a liar and a deceiver. Shame on you.
13078,bfThiqDd9FA,march 4th is my birthday
13079,bfThiqDd9FA,That's a fart from the moon...
13080,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how everybody loves everything about this vid
13081,bfThiqDd9FA,"Awesome to see something that is that far away go in full speed, definitely how it will look if this is really happening 😂🤣😂"
13082,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how impact needed so much computation power that the fps of reality dropped
13083,bfThiqDd9FA,-_-
13084,bfThiqDd9FA,Yea the explosion happened before it even hit bit good work
13085,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro your cg skill are pretty decent. Contact me if you want work
13086,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Q and patriots just nuked the illuminati shapeshifting reptilian communist CCP moon base
13087,bfThiqDd9FA,You win. You can work at Marvel now.
13088,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the moon
13089,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many scientists are on this post
13090,bfThiqDd9FA,So fluffy - wheeeeeeeee!
13091,bfThiqDd9FA,A.I. is so radical! Woooooo
13092,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hmm i'm not sure, the impact is instant and the shape of the moon where it hits i felt it was prior to impact"
13093,bfThiqDd9FA,NICE COMP  the puff fps looks like it dropping frames
13094,bfThiqDd9FA,WTF.....I LOVE...
13095,bfThiqDd9FA,Falso que casualidad siempre hay alguien filmando jajjaj y mas falso aun por q deberia proyectarse la sombra del humo en la superficie de la luna.
13096,bfThiqDd9FA,Project Blue Beam
13097,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud was a little bit Laggy first 😂
13098,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the bird is ignorant of the incident.
13099,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my mom ❤
13100,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
13101,bfThiqDd9FA,It looked like the moon farted😂
13102,bfThiqDd9FA,So full of shit.
13103,bfThiqDd9FA,I really wish that explosion was done better.
13104,bfThiqDd9FA,I love.
13105,bfThiqDd9FA,Start every comment  with I LOVE....
13106,bfThiqDd9FA,Love love.
13107,bfThiqDd9FA,one thing is that the camera man is watching the moon in the morning?!
13108,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how ET collided into the moon
13109,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the plume of smoke travelling that distance from the surface of the moon at the speed it was travelling would have to exceed the speed of light, which is impossible within the laws of physics."
13110,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the frame rate dropped specifically for the mushroom cloud but not the rest of the clouds/trees
13111,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
13112,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there's a day moon and a night moon
13113,bfThiqDd9FA,Was that Wile E Coyote crashing into the moon?
13114,bfThiqDd9FA,lmfao
13115,bfThiqDd9FA,just 3 or 4 nuclear explosions in one no biggie .
13116,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow 😮
13117,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon is only 66.6 miles away under the firmament.
13118,bfThiqDd9FA,"Firstly this could have made  *headlines* and secondly mushroom explosions can't occur in space you need the atmosphere  for that to happen

Don't even know why I'm stating the obvious"
13119,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ignoring the whole atmosphere issue.

Even our largest most destructive thermonuclear warhead detonating would produce an explosion so relatively small, compared to the moon, that no one would notice."
13120,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, the speed required...😂"
13121,bfThiqDd9FA,"Comparing to the size of the moon and explosion cloud, looks like humanity had detonated its most powerful nuclear weapon on the moon."
13122,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments start with “ I love how”
13123,bfThiqDd9FA,Science is hard 🙃
13124,bfThiqDd9FA,at least make the explosion realistic not like nuke on earth.
13125,bfThiqDd9FA,Great a moon fart
13126,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video is the clearest video of a nuke bomb hitting the moon and we cant get bigfoot on camera
13127,bfThiqDd9FA,"What, no comet tail?"
13128,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love .... 
Lamp?"
13129,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love it when the comments on videos are original.















I don't mean this one of course."
13130,bfThiqDd9FA,even my grandma makes the best video montage that this
13131,bfThiqDd9FA,I love these comments.❤
13132,bfThiqDd9FA,north korea rocket testing... don't worry.....
13133,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro farted

I just live crack

Apparently we all do"
13138,bfThiqDd9FA,How trees created on earth.. Example in gods grapics...
13139,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how a cloud of dust that is possibly hundreds of miles tall, went up in a matter of seconds."
13140,bfThiqDd9FA,You can actually see something in the sky headed to the moon just before impact.
13141,bfThiqDd9FA,Because there will be no muhroom cloud if there is no air
13142,bfThiqDd9FA,bullshit
13143,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love
13144,bfThiqDd9FA,Why did EVERYONE start with “I Love”?
13145,bfThiqDd9FA,"Respect our minds, oh"
13146,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people don't ask why it's not possible anymore to get to the moon
13147,bfThiqDd9FA,I love turtles
13148,bfThiqDd9FA,"it looks as if there was atmosphere on the moon, like this debris is moving   :/"
13149,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we nukes the aliens on the moon. Teach them a lesson about invading earth.
13150,bfThiqDd9FA,"Huge explosion expanding at half the speed of light. 
Yeah sure, that’s legit."

13172,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah I don't believe it there wasn't even no impact on the moon it wasn't even close to it was up in the clouds and you went boom and that's what you call an explosion on planet wrong

13190,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice video you created there, cloud at the end how it fades out looks unrealistic."
13191,bfThiqDd9FA,"1. Missile should not be visible.
2. The explosion was larger than the largest nuclear explosion - the Tsar Bomba.
3. The speed of the events was far too fast.
4. The mushroom cloud occurred in a vacuum, and faded in seconds."

13306,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Anti-Sxcial The moon is NOT in our atmosphere.
13307,bfThiqDd9FA,@andeeboyy2126  not only that but it's gravity would cause major issues to our oceans. Causing massive waves to form.
13308,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@lalo9966 Of course it would send debris up…. But not into the “sky” because there isn’t one on the moon. What you see in this video is debris flying up and being affected by an atmosphere (the mushroom effect is caused by turbulence in the atmosphere after the impact) but there isn’t one on the moon so it’s not realistic of what would actually happen. Nonetheless, it’s still a cool video."

13319,bfThiqDd9FA,@@wayniebob1948 look closely at the footage where that happens.  You'll see that the dust falls immediately back down to the surface. There is no atmosphere so there is no friction to slow the dust so you won't see any sort of dust cloud.

13394,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how I lovely love love.






LOVE!!"
13395,bfThiqDd9FA,"The ""dust cloud"" is way too unrealistic."
13396,bfThiqDd9FA,Goodbye science
13397,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought moon just farted
13398,bfThiqDd9FA,I also always film the moon handheld…. Just in case
13399,bfThiqDd9FA,That is SpaceX Wayward rocket crashing to the moon
13400,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah ....you found the comment in which you were looking for the extinction of word ""love"""
13401,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely done special effects 👍
13402,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how none of you know wtf you are talking about
13403,bfThiqDd9FA,This is one of the absolute fakest things I’ve ever seen
13404,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
13405,bfThiqDd9FA,This is optimus prime 😊in the moon crash site
13406,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
13407,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the earth didn't feel any shock waves during that time.
13408,bfThiqDd9FA,Absolutely brilliant.
13409,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon vapes.
13410,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
13411,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Love🤣
13412,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how all comments love something bout this video 😂🤣Moon go boom
13413,bfThiqDd9FA,"I Love How all comments begin with, “I Love How…”"
13414,bfThiqDd9FA,The flat earth society is going to have a field day 😂
13415,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
13416,bfThiqDd9FA,Impact of that scale would burn the back of your skull right through your eyes
13417,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the spaceship collided exactly at the perfect curvature so we have excellent view !
13418,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that the spaceship is at least 34 km big to be visible.
13419,bfThiqDd9FA,Bo to było nagrywane kamerą 2D 😅
13420,bfThiqDd9FA,Adobe After Effects
13421,bfThiqDd9FA,Yup it’s that bright and the moons out
13422,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow so many locations ive blinked and missed 420 of them
13423,bfThiqDd9FA,Allah akbar...
13424,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody loves something in this clip
13425,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you. 👊
13426,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahahahahah
13427,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 BS
13428,bfThiqDd9FA,What a bullshit!
13429,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats saitama landing on moon when boros punch him
13430,bfThiqDd9FA,"es un montaje, ciencia ficción, pero si entretiene"
13431,bfThiqDd9FA,My thoughts and prayers are with the rocket 🚀 🙏 😢
13432,bfThiqDd9FA,But what about Rocket Jr and mrs rocket you monster??
13433,bfThiqDd9FA,Ammm ok. That's not how things work in a vacuum and near zero gravity
13434,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is no atmosphere in space, you would not see a dust plume like that.."
13435,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yo, If the moon are moving that fast what would become of earth's weather"
13436,bfThiqDd9FA,An object travelling at over a million miles an hour.
13437,bfThiqDd9FA,That looks to be about 300 miles across
13438,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun clip.  The dust cloud was done wrong.  The less gravity on the moon would have created a different type of impact cloud.
13439,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought that there is no atmosphere on our moon that would slow down a possible impact cloud like that and make such a cloud. :D
13440,bfThiqDd9FA,This rocket part must be exceptionally huge. Is it made by aliens?
13441,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
13442,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you guys
13443,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitima back at it again.. 😂
13444,bfThiqDd9FA,Rad
13445,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how we can spot a rocket 238,855 miles away"
13446,bfThiqDd9FA,I would like a refund please! 😂
13447,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a beautiful special effect... ✴️
13448,bfThiqDd9FA,How are these garbage videos get so many views!?!!
13449,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love all the comments
13450,bfThiqDd9FA,that was saitama when he was fighting boro and got kicked to the moon
13451,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
13452,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is bull, in space the dust would not make that configration as well as how bug the inpact was!  really?"
13453,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you have Zero idea of thermo dynamics, you don't get mushroom clouds in space"
13454,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many times I've seen comments started with I love how 😂
13455,bfThiqDd9FA,This is Project Blue Beam
13456,bfThiqDd9FA,"ЛУНА НА ТАКАЯ БОЛЬШАЯ - dalbek, ???? - 2023"
13457,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is so big 👌 👏
13458,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂 do people actually buy this BS
13459,bfThiqDd9FA,"Get your FX correct.  First, the atmostphere on the moon is different.  The plume wouldn't look like it does on Earth.  Second, speed vs. scale.  The dynamics of the plume are too fast for the size defined against the scale of the moon.   And lastly, the angle of impact does not one up correctly with the angle of the plume."
13460,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that Saitama?
13461,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how so many people watching this even they know this is BS, Oh shit its almost 2:25 am good night."
13462,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to watch the comments. Not the video 😂
13463,bfThiqDd9FA,worthless try :(
13464,bfThiqDd9FA,Halp Ukraine
13465,bfThiqDd9FA,Like we'd be able to see a rocket landing on Mars FROM EARTH 💀
13466,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to read the lovely comments of the lovely people describing exactly what they love
13467,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm totally for nuking the moon on the fourth of July every year.  Js
13468,bfThiqDd9FA,An object that massive hitting the moon would do more than that... cmon now
13469,bfThiqDd9FA,"DOES EVERYONE START THEIR SENTENCES IN THE SAME FASHION!?!? ' I love how...""  SMH"
13470,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how when you use your cellphone to look at even a car a few km away it's a barely visible pixel but this guy can see better with his cellphone that most telescopes.
13471,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I had to make my comment very specific.
13472,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
13473,bfThiqDd9FA,I love beer cannabis and women
13474,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s worth stumbling on these ridiculous fakes sometimes just to soak up the comedy in the comments 😂😂
13475,bfThiqDd9FA,"I’m surprised we didn’t get a sonic boom several seconds after impact. We need a big boom to follow an explosion like that, just seeing it didn’t really do it for me."
13476,bfThiqDd9FA,source: I saw it on internet.
13477,bfThiqDd9FA,Nur Blödsinn mein Gott was computer alles macht viele glauben sogar dran
13478,bfThiqDd9FA,claro que sí campeón...
13479,bfThiqDd9FA,On my birthday really!
13480,bfThiqDd9FA,So the Moon is not in Space! As too the Plasma Sun!
13481,bfThiqDd9FA,"Me: looks at description
Also Me: I ain't readin' allat."
13482,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody is saying that they love stuff about this
13483,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the 10fps mushroom cloud 💀
13484,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the birds singing and the blue sky!
13485,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the moons out and its day time
13486,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it took until 2022 to capture this .  Now we know exactly how the moon craters were made .
13487,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon is farting😂
13488,bfThiqDd9FA,I love what I love and I don't love what I don't love
13489,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
13490,bfThiqDd9FA,This is really stupid!
13491,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣😅😆😂🤣
13492,bfThiqDd9FA,Everybody in the comment section is a rocket scientist
13493,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how someone is just randomly recording the moon
13494,bfThiqDd9FA,"First of all the moon isn’t that close to earth, second of all, if something crashed on the moon, an explosion like THAT is not going to be possible at all, you’re talking a bomb that’s like 1000 times as powerful as a meteor, thirdly, if an explosion like that DID occur, it wouldn’t just take on the form of a mushroom cloud that quick."
13495,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all it didn't crash on the moon-
13496,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone says, I love."
13497,bfThiqDd9FA,Moonfall 😂
13498,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the cloud has a slower frame rate
13499,bfThiqDd9FA,bro thinks saitama crushed on moon
13500,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama vs boros
13501,bfThiqDd9FA,Did it make a noise ?
13502,bfThiqDd9FA,How did he know when to tape to moon fart? I never see it on time! This guy filmed it!
13503,bfThiqDd9FA,Poo
13504,bfThiqDd9FA,Lack of camera tracking skill
13505,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh no!! Now all the airs gonna escape!!
13506,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy that you saw that and managed to film it praise god.
13507,bfThiqDd9FA,"Appears from behind a cloud. 
Crashes into the moon at almost the speed of light.
Fades into a 10 fps but high resolution mushroom cloud.
Refuses to elaborate."
13508,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't love anything.
13509,bfThiqDd9FA,Out of the explosion forms and rests a beautiful white rose on the moon 💕
13510,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I had to do an “I love how” comment after reading all the comments 😅
13511,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
13512,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you all think you know all this stuff about globes and space but it's just memorised jargon from someone else's memorised jargon,"
13513,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahaahhahahhahahahaha so funny.
13514,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video makes my mind wander
13515,bfThiqDd9FA,How amazing you just happened to be outside with your camera at that time and you just happened to be able to look up and see that this was happening. You must be psychic or something....... GTFO here ya nutdack!
13516,bfThiqDd9FA,Not to mention the debris cloud dissapating in mere seconds instead of lingering for months or years as would actually occur.
13517,bfThiqDd9FA,Caralho
13518,bfThiqDd9FA,How does this video have 7.3 million views. The internet is filled with mentally handicaped people.
13519,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love that this happend 10 months ago, and same person filmed it :O so random"
13520,bfThiqDd9FA,Jesus is watchin...
13521,bfThiqDd9FA,How the fuck is dat moon moving
13522,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, first video of the moon farting😮"
13523,bfThiqDd9FA,I love McDonald...
13524,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every comment starts with I love 😂
13525,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how a rocket part can create a dust cloud thats a quater the size of the moon/Australia
13526,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker than a Trump statement.
13527,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌👌
13528,bfThiqDd9FA,Scam :/
13529,bfThiqDd9FA,I love all the comments 😂🤙🏻
13530,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
13531,bfThiqDd9FA,The glitchy mushroom cloud is VERY convincing.😂
13532,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon deserved that.
13533,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like a poot.
13534,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how quick the dust disappeared 😂
13535,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh wow it's 20 fps in space, didn't know our cameras can crack it.."
13536,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much love was found watching this loveable clip of a much loved natural monument that we've all im sure have know and loved from childhood to adult as have many generations in the past have loved it also. Hopefully our much loved moon is around for many generations more to find reasons why they the love this clip so much also.
13537,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments
13538,bfThiqDd9FA,WOW IS SO AMAZING BUT I hate in earthquake but im not turkey in Bangladesh but I don't hate im 9 years old
13539,bfThiqDd9FA,there's so much love in the comments section
13540,bfThiqDd9FA,"Efeito especial, legal hein?😊"
13541,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people seriously questioning this.
13542,bfThiqDd9FA,It's like MOON fart💨 😂😂😂
13543,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is out in the middle of the day!
13544,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every single comment on here starts with I love how 😂
13545,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how 💃
13546,bfThiqDd9FA,That thing gave the whole moon  atmosphere while getting blown up to add some drama to the clip :-)
13547,bfThiqDd9FA,It is what they want you to believe... the moon is a plasma and reflects the earth. Greetings from Venezuela. the truth is beyond the ice barriers.
13548,bfThiqDd9FA,I enjoyed that.
13549,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see where the trans dks that were cut were being sent too.
13550,bfThiqDd9FA,Not sure if it was a quantum or photon tornado 🤔
13551,bfThiqDd9FA,Its like riding a mountain bike naked but riding it backwards...
13552,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how sometimes when i pee i aim at the sides of the bowl so its not so loud
13553,bfThiqDd9FA,0:27
13554,bfThiqDd9FA,this is absolutely hoax. manipulated image. holy crap!
13555,bfThiqDd9FA,its not a manipulated image.  look again.
13556,bfThiqDd9FA,Revenge of the fallen directors cut
13557,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah the familiar wriggle(2,4) function in AE"
13558,bfThiqDd9FA,yes very realistic
13559,bfThiqDd9FA,"What is loooooove anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway.... wooah ... oooohh..."
13560,bfThiqDd9FA,moon is to see with love not for  this kind of activity.
13561,bfThiqDd9FA,Alot of Love in these comments 😏💖
13562,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does moon looks bigger on video when we see it on earth smaller
13563,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my wife
13564,bfThiqDd9FA,Now i know who asked
13565,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how this person put…. View from a different location.

That statement right there shows that this person knows absolutely nothing about the moon or probably anything else 

Doesn’t matter where you are on the Earth. The moon is tidally locked in earths orbit, so we will always see the same face of the moon, no matter where we are on the planet so if the moon is out and you can see it in California or Boston, you’re seeing the exact same thing

Beyond that this video, I’ll be an interesting is a complete fabrication because an explosion on the moon would not look like a mushroom cloud because there is no atmosphere 

Learn how physics works and try again"
13566,bfThiqDd9FA,All comments here starting with..I love😮
13567,bfThiqDd9FA,Bit bit bit bit bit
13568,bfThiqDd9FA,It's the same thing on why people think we have been to the moon! We can't even get out of low earth orbit. You have been scammed humans.
13569,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love How We BrainWash Each other ..till the Point.. We don't believe in Anything even With Proof..  sad reality And I love how Everyone in comments has Been to Space
13570,bfThiqDd9FA,All the comments making fun of the timing and the effects. Bit does nobidy notice how big the moon is?
13571,bfThiqDd9FA,"You'd think an explosion several thousand miles high and across, to be seen from there, would have a huge shockwave..."
13572,bfThiqDd9FA,prophet muhommad cut moon into 2 pieces
13573,bfThiqDd9FA,Optical Flares but no good enough.
13574,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in sunlight
13575,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm disappointed I suckered myself into watching this trash
13576,bfThiqDd9FA,What do you love about this video ?
13577,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud didn't take 6x's longer to settle
13578,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
13579,bfThiqDd9FA,I love beer.
13580,bfThiqDd9FA,love how many views from a single effect
13581,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how we are united in loving this video
13582,bfThiqDd9FA,i love that a comment being confused about the authenticity of the video was pinned
13583,bfThiqDd9FA,i just love comment sections like this.
13584,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love how NASA just had a rocket the size of Manhattan flying around with a speed of several hundred kilometers per second, instantaneously creating an explosion roughly the size of texas"
13585,bfThiqDd9FA,It's amazing that guy knew exact moment when something would hit the moon.
13586,bfThiqDd9FA,Не знал конечно просто снимал 👀
13587,bfThiqDd9FA,Who is the original lover?
13588,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing what people can do on a pc these days.
13589,bfThiqDd9FA,I love all the love
13590,bfThiqDd9FA,Totally.
13591,bfThiqDd9FA,dang it got hit by a moon 🌚
13592,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how a lot of comments here start with I love how
13593,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
13594,bfThiqDd9FA,Its the ark of sentinel prime
13595,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love his reaction for this totaly choking envent
13596,bfThiqDd9FA,"false because if the moon was hit by a meteor, the earth's gravity would be gone and we humans would float on air"
13597,bfThiqDd9FA,"Has anyone actually read the full description in the thumb nail, they say its an old rocket part thats been flying around for years and its going to hit the moon, nasa are excited to see the outcome plus the new crater which MIGHT be as big as 65ft (20 meters) OMG, yes its total nonsense, i didn't know we had built rockets the size of large countries, and after being used they speed up to about 10% the speed of light!!!"
13598,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂
13599,bfThiqDd9FA,What kind of shit is this?
13600,bfThiqDd9FA,"According to most comments you guys defetnely ""Love"" this."
13601,bfThiqDd9FA,Too many Mormons.
13602,bfThiqDd9FA,The comet is too speedy. 😅 Looks like lightspeed.
13603,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how recent this event took place.
13604,bfThiqDd9FA,That means the moon 🌙 anomaly 50 miles up
13605,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks so rendered. Try again.
13606,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how no one else caught this historical moment
13607,bfThiqDd9FA,Never seen so many love comments before.
13608,bfThiqDd9FA,😂 nice work.
13609,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how lovably lovely the loving moon looks.
13610,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you guys
13611,bfThiqDd9FA,Mutfilmdi bu😂😂
13612,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud looked glitchy for one. And when do you ever see the moon that big and clear during the day?
13613,bfThiqDd9FA,The headassery here is unfathomable
13614,bfThiqDd9FA,I dont got anything smart to say. but I have to continue with the trend so I love how the birds were signaling that something was going to happen to get the camera man's attention to look at the right place at the right time to capture a once in a life time event.
13615,bfThiqDd9FA,Mormon
13616,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how i just dont get this
13617,bfThiqDd9FA,I love these lovely comments
13618,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to watch a moon fart!
13619,bfThiqDd9FA,How possible that you can see the moon from the ground an expect that huge blasting?😅😅😅😅
13620,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to be here in 2023 reading about so much love ❤
13621,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people say i love how.......
13622,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lunar impacts are getting sketchy 😭
—>
I love how y’all are just saying the same thing as everyone else. How original."
13623,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how everyone loves something about this video.
13624,bfThiqDd9FA,So natural like a runway lights
13625,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon has 100km radius craters and we didn’t saw that Happen, the moon is so far you’ll never see something like that"
13626,bfThiqDd9FA,"This comment section is less fucked than I anticipated as I read the title and watched that preposterous horse shit. Thank god . Also that was legitimately hilarious, why? People literally subscribe to propaganda. Viral. Boom first red flag in seemingly any context. Fed up with virus and space bullshit. To the 45 thousand likes, any of those which are not bots, the fuck? Get with it and stop participating gleefully with this propogated hysterical and broadcast ignorance. If we stop playing along, all of us, everywhere, if all of us stopped voting and using money and paying taxes and working in industry and using money and buying anything and we grew out food and sense of community and self and the divine and truth. I have never lived in a world of truth where information passed by and through my knowing was wholly true, in fact seemingly mostly untrue, and the truths were mainly self evident since I can remember, common sense aspects of living apparent in nature. What is this artifice we possess of and endear. The reason objective and critical thought appear lost in the screens is because it is writ to be so. Social media and media of any kind beyond the pure and honest pursuit of knowledge wisdom and information from a respectable source is jolly, cheers. Expression by writ word of all kinds, or any work of effort of hand or heart, or a means to display such things, lovely, I imagine social media could be sociable if you extricate the media from it, and otherwise abandon ship, BCS the obstinance and psychosis of being battered by ads and sensless frivolous bullshit is onset and cumulative and level heads will prevail until they don't, any thing moving and stumble and any stumble can lead to a fall. Spirals go on, and return to themselves. When all else fails reject unnatural impetus and turn inward, and outward into nature and then come back to yourself. Beautiful things are everywhere and distraction in nature is simply observation."
13627,bfThiqDd9FA,"could you rephrase that, please?"
13628,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone know if the moon is okay?  Someone needs to go over there and check on things.
13629,bfThiqDd9FA,I think the moon farted.   🤔
13630,bfThiqDd9FA,단합력 좋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
13631,bfThiqDd9FA,"No shadow, 😔 well i want to say ""you tried"" You see the thing is that i do not litter,  loiter, limbo or lie!  So i won't be saying it.  .
🙄😒"
13632,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how annoying this video and these comments are.
13633,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the video frame-skipped immediately after impact.
13634,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
13635,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket exploded like a 3fps video
13636,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how quickly the MASSIVE dust cloud just dissipates and is suddenly gone in seconds!
13637,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every comment begins with same word 😂
13638,bfThiqDd9FA,"And that's 380,000km away from earth?"
13639,bfThiqDd9FA,“I love how love has been efficiently used here” 💙
13640,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon is smoke a lot today
13641,bfThiqDd9FA,"plane crash into the moon, terrorist atack"
13642,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love when it's lovely and when love can be what love was meant to be. There is no greater love than the love that one feels for the one you love. Lovely is the lover who can love you long time.

13673,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it just disappeared
13674,bfThiqDd9FA,You shouldn't entice mentally ill people.
13675,bfThiqDd9FA,This is well made who made this?
13676,bfThiqDd9FA,"wow, must have been a powerful impact for the mushroom cloud to travel and former faster than light speed."
13677,bfThiqDd9FA,Как ты измерил скорость ??
13678,bfThiqDd9FA,On my birthday 💀💀
13679,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama wa there bro😂

13683,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how out of scale that object was from earth.
13684,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate the fact that this whole thing was faked
13685,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon should not be out in the day time
13686,bfThiqDd9FA,Huh? I hope you are joking.
13687,bfThiqDd9FA,I love….
13688,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in the comments put I love at the start of the sentence lmao 🤣
13689,bfThiqDd9FA,"haha, how false is this, to begin with the moon looks blurry during the day and less appreciates the object that collides with it😂😂😂"
13690,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is not owned by NASA
13691,bfThiqDd9FA,Almost zero gravity up there so the mushroom cloud wouldn't rise that fast
13692,bfThiqDd9FA,I love when my butt cheeks clap when I fart out of my moon.
13693,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't know about love but do y'all know what I hate the fact that everyone just keeps repeating what everyone else says as their first partner says I love how the moon does this I love how the moon does that come up with something original.
13694,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I only ran into it original comment and not somebody saying I love how this
13695,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how almost every comment section I love is how that, and I love this excetera excetera excetera. I love that I would think of the same person. Somebody obviously has multiple accounts. I'm being sarcastic because it's getting kinda old to the point where you would think it's the same person just using different accounts to say the same thing."

13699,bfThiqDd9FA,Is there anyone who believe this 😅😅
13700,bfThiqDd9FA,why the explotion its in 15fps HAHAHAHA
13701,bfThiqDd9FA,"I guess there really are people that will believe anything.  I am amazed NASA and the press missed this ""historic"" event.  Do not use YouTube as your source for reliable news.🤣"
13702,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's agree we all love to see something like this in reality
13703,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my wife
13704,bfThiqDd9FA,"Cloud of the impact is stuttering, maybe increase the frame rate next time"
13705,bfThiqDd9FA,I love wasting my time on youtube watching these nonsense things
13706,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that this dust cloud has only 15 fps in this video.
13707,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ha ha ha ha , People are still genius !"
13708,bfThiqDd9FA,love that a crash looks that big from so far away
13709,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you didn't put the I @ the begging of your sentence.

13740,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
13741,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
13742,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how at the initial impact of the explosion the cloud drops in fps while the rest of the video stays the same fps
13743,bfThiqDd9FA,Love the Love.
13744,bfThiqDd9FA,Montage assez réussi sauf pour les lois de la physique qu'il faut sérieusement revoir. Mais les images sont jolies.
13745,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is an outtake of “Bruce Almighty”. 😂
13746,bfThiqDd9FA,"Diameter of the moon according to liars at NASA is approx 2,200 miles. That would make that impact cloud about 500 miles high and took 1 second to get that big…. 😂😂😂 I bet people believe this anyway. That cloud would have had to travel at 1.8 million mph 😂"
13747,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this from ballon fest 86 love it
13748,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to copy

13758,bfThiqDd9FA,"The land area of Australia is some 7.69 million square kilometers and the surface area of the Moon is 37.94 million square kilometres, close to five times the area of Australia.
And how bloody fast is that ""rocket"" going... And how big is the rocket and that not what collisions look like in a vacuum.

If your going lie too people
At least make it based on science and make it believable."
13759,bfThiqDd9FA,I can't believe it's not butter
13760,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does every comment start with ... I Love how!!!😅
13761,bfThiqDd9FA,"Haha, nice. I wonder if anything like this has been seen in human history? Probably"
13762,bfThiqDd9FA,"Obviously, I mean an asteroid collision"
13763,bfThiqDd9FA,"People just FALLIN LOVE with this video
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
13764,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is SO lame and how gullible most people are. I FREAKING love it!

13769,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG😮 do nasa know about this? 😟
13770,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the person knew to aim the camera at the sky that very moment.
13771,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that a cloud is hart shaped
13772,bfThiqDd9FA,U lying piece of 💩
13773,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, was the object flying close to 3000 km/s? At this speed It would leave even the Milk Way or the Local Group. A new possibility to do an intergalactic trip."
13774,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't worry guys. Saitama Will jump back to earth like nothing
13775,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how flat Earthers haven’t explained this with their supreme and logical scientific analysis!!
13776,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the Moon loves getting creampie’d in front of the whole Earth!!
13777,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the aliens on the other side of the Moon didn’t zap it with their laser cannons!!
13778,bfThiqDd9FA,"È fatto bene, sembra vero 😂"
13779,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every single comment, except just one, starts with ""I love""😂"
13780,bfThiqDd9FA,Beaucoup de I love how... 🤣🤣🤣
13781,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to love but my baby just loves to dance.
13782,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp.
13783,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is frickin big than mars
13784,bfThiqDd9FA,"Sure, a billowing dust cloud in a vacuum :'-)"
13785,bfThiqDd9FA,Really? So on atmospheric explosion cloud without an atmosphere. 🤣
13786,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE THIS SHIT!! 😅
13787,bfThiqDd9FA,This is my sisters birthday date-
13788,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nah, that thing would’ve shattered the moon entirely."
13789,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how... I love how !
13790,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone in the comment section  keeps saying I love how😂😐😂😐😑.

13791,bfThiqDd9FA,"no one:

13792,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
13793,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why all comments start with ""i love.."""
13794,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the object is so visible as if the moon and object where both inside of the eraths atmosphere.
13795,bfThiqDd9FA,So fast the speed it grew into a 🍄 mushroom the meteor that is.
13796,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yea I seen a pig fly by my window this morning, unfortunately unlike you I didn't have my camera at the ready at that precise moment."
13797,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how a rocket is about the size of a big asteroid and a big asteroid would be a few hundred km in diameter
13798,bfThiqDd9FA,I love eggs
13799,bfThiqDd9FA,The frame rate on the moon must be 2 fps
13800,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone says  I love how, which makes me love how everyone is loving how to be a sheep."
13801,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is so big
13802,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is just a moon fart.
13803,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
13804,bfThiqDd9FA,it looked like the moon tooted 😂

13807,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate this
13808,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the little birds chirping in the background
13809,bfThiqDd9FA,Plume shape is wrong for a non-atmospheric body. Mushroom cloud comes from cool air rushing in from sides a hot air from collision/explosion rises. This is only typical in an atmosphere were the moon has none.
13810,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try . . . but dust rise slowly and takes more than hour to spread as shown in this video
13811,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my wife but hate this video
13812,bfThiqDd9FA,What a crock of BS! True life!
13813,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how

13834,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people notice the fakeness :)
13835,bfThiqDd9FA,It is funny how moon dust floats as asteroid impacts it as if there is no air in moon. RIP Physics.

13857,bfThiqDd9FA,exactly why its faked
13858,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that small spacecraft is able to reflect light or be visible from such a distance even though we still need updates from nasa just to view the space station. Also that dust cloud; how amazing 😐.

The new Premier would help that dust cloud transition, and distance gauging. Then your moon won't look like it's about to hit us, and you dust cloud will obey Einstein's law about light speed. Be pretty sweet for a commercial or something though, where it would use that unbelievability to it's benefit. Like something for a car, or HEY! Roger Waters might use it for a darkside promo or something, if he's not too busy eating red pills."

13923,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody loves something in these youtube comments. So much love. Its a nice change.
13924,bfThiqDd9FA,I love How I ended up here

13927,bfThiqDd9FA,"Man, first global warming, then COVID and now this!?!"
13928,bfThiqDd9FA,Very good image stabilization! If you handheld a 600mm lens and didn't use a tripod like normal people would under these circumstances... I have questions..🤔.
13929,bfThiqDd9FA,What is this. I don't have to understand
13930,bfThiqDd9FA,Only this person can see the moon in blue sky during the day😊
13931,bfThiqDd9FA,Have you never been outside before?
13932,bfThiqDd9FA,Super moon Crash to moon
13933,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious.
13934,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how we can see stars at night and shiny space rocks at day, really romantic"
13935,bfThiqDd9FA,So many things wrong here
13936,bfThiqDd9FA,i wonder how the moon is this close
13937,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is 450'000 kilometer away from earth. The spaceship is still seen from earth because of light reflection. Light travel lightly. Due to massive atmospheric ozone layer,the cloud will seen platonic. The way the explosion react is called Ceronaplex effect."
13938,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon became ""The Apple logo"""
13939,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves something about this clip
13940,bfThiqDd9FA,We get it!!!! You vape
13941,bfThiqDd9FA,Мне нравится как поют птички и не мешает им шум этого взрыва на луне !
13942,bfThiqDd9FA,"what app was used in this, i want it"
13943,bfThiqDd9FA,Great chi
13944,bfThiqDd9FA,I love just how a mushroom cloud has formed at a fraction of a second like there was an atmosphere on the moon begin with.
13945,bfThiqDd9FA,At lest there is a lot of love going around .  I love that
13946,bfThiqDd9FA,I love all of your mom's
13947,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in this comment section is actually smart
13948,bfThiqDd9FA,So that rocket is damn near 100 miles lomg
13949,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the gigantic plume of dust and debris just completely disappears over the course of a few seconds. And at 8 FPS too.
13950,bfThiqDd9FA,The birds tweeting make this super authentic
13951,bfThiqDd9FA,My question is. *WHY IS THE MOON SO CLOSE?*
13952,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
13953,bfThiqDd9FA,Se ascoltate bene si sente anche il botto😂😂😂😂😂😂
13954,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Marty Mcfly decided to steal a girls hoverboard to escape griff and his gang instead of just running away on foot.
13955,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that clearly the moon is made of cheese.
13956,bfThiqDd9FA,I love...my dog.

13961,bfThiqDd9FA,"It looked more like the MOON was......









Farting.....💀⚰️"
13962,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the moon's ""impact"" cloud exhibited the discretion to remain incognito by not only merging with Earth's atmospheric clouds, but also its jetstream."
13963,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama is comming
13964,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how

13969,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the cloud expands like its in an atmosphere in 15 fps
13970,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every frikkin comment on this video begins with what the commenter loves?  Just a bunch of loving folks is what we are!!

13973,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this 40 second vid has 7 million views
13974,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s fakes since not only A. Mushroom clouds can’t happen in space and B. Since you can’t see any satellites/rockets during the day only during sunsets, sunrises, and clear nights."
13975,bfThiqDd9FA,I love apple tart.
13976,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂...😁

13978,bfThiqDd9FA,"So many problems with this. 😂
The dust moved at a different fps to the clouds. The speed of the dust is insane."
13979,bfThiqDd9FA,That's when Saitama vs Dark Mater Fight happened
13980,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom clouds require an ATMOSPHERE.  GFY
13981,bfThiqDd9FA,I love u guys
13982,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love that everybody is writing ""i love"" (so much love on earth)"
13983,bfThiqDd9FA,What in the moon fart is this 🌕💨
13984,bfThiqDd9FA,"At the 11th second on the right top, if you can see those clouds you will realise something, A FACE.



Comment me if you saw that."
13985,bfThiqDd9FA,"I’m not astrophysicist or mathematician but I’m pretty certain that if an object at that distance were to be traveling at the speed visualize it would be about 700,000 mph. Don’t even get me started at the dust cloud that was thrown out 8000 miles out within one second. 🥴"
13986,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how this is the only video of this , in the entire world... this is what's called a scoop."
13987,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is spreading and sharing the love😂
13988,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that the moon absorbs about 90 percent of meteors that would strike the earth.
13989,bfThiqDd9FA,I just just just just just love it.🤡
13990,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao fakest video all time

13995,bfThiqDd9FA,Loved how the cameraman risked his life for humanity
13996,bfThiqDd9FA,Isnt the moon drifting away not coming closer?
13997,bfThiqDd9FA,BULLSHIT!!!!
13998,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the love how
13999,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video totally proves that the Earth is flat.
14000,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it couldn't possibly.
14001,bfThiqDd9FA,Never realized the universe renders explosions in stop motion
14002,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a mixed up crazy universe out there.
14003,bfThiqDd9FA,What kind of bird was that
14004,bfThiqDd9FA,"LMAO 
Dude, that bird was other wordly"
14005,bfThiqDd9FA,When I was scrolling all I see is a pic of a moon farting
14006,bfThiqDd9FA,Legend see 2023year🙈
14007,bfThiqDd9FA,Ayoooo
14008,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is smoking 🌜🚬

14018,bfThiqDd9FA,"😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣""I love"" these comments 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭"
14019,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon not a solid object. It's. Plasma reflection of bigger earth like a glass bowl over a flat map that's why edges are curved.  Crators are just domes.  Not that many creators the moon image is like many transparences of of one photo with domes taking at different times.  This is why many creators line up and lay on top of each other many times.  There are many domed worlds under great dome
14020,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon knew exactly when to break wind😅
14021,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't know we could see a rocket from here (sarcasm)

14036,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the loveliness of these loving comments from living lovelies
14037,bfThiqDd9FA,That's totally anime bullshit logic. And I think that was Saitama from one punch man.
14038,bfThiqDd9FA,Morning me moon bhi nikel ta hai kya
14039,bfThiqDd9FA,Should have knocked the moon out of orbit...
14040,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the gullibility of the eathlings actually believing this is really a rocket when other sources know the truth..
14041,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess you you live closest to the moon😂
14042,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the moon
14043,bfThiqDd9FA,I have come to the conclusion that this is not a rocket it is a star

14075,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is sharper than the moon.
14076,bfThiqDd9FA,Because explosions on the moon have a lower frame rate than on earth
14077,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
14078,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket is roughly the size of the state of Rhode Island.  I didn't realize we had rockets that big!

14148,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon not exploded.
14149,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the framerate of the explosion was different than the frame rate of the clouds in the sky, that must be due to the effects of a large explosion on space-time itself."
14150,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the object was visible but also from where the canerman was but also had no flight path
14151,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how ....🤣🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️

14259,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see the rocket even though it's orders of magnitude smaller than the moon and there's no way it would be visible over such a distance.

The collision created a mushroom cloud of dust and debris that was so large it could be seen from Earth with a telescope. The impact also carved out a crater on the far side of the moon that was estimated to be about 20 meters in diameter45."

14275,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shriast5156 Given the diameter of the moon is 2,159 miles, that means that rocket part is approximately 45 miles big. And if that’s just a “rocket part” it means the whole rocket would be hundreds of miles big.

Second, from the equation Speed = Distance/Time, that 45 mile wide rocket part was traveling at approximately 1,977,710 miles per hour - this means we have the technology to get to Mars in 7 hours!!

Third, the only way you can get a cloud on the moon is if the moon has an atmosphere"
14276,bfThiqDd9FA,"ahhh, the  ""you always see a laggy hundred thousand kilometres big and with lightning speed expanding steam cloud in non existant airspace if a rocket part that is of course bright as the sun hits the moon, just 300 thousand kilometres away, showing the impact directly parallel to our point of view.""

14282,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow how coincidental they captured a perfect object making a perfect mushroom cloud on the moon. No shenanigans here at all.
14283,bfThiqDd9FA,not to mention its speed. That thing travelled like one moon diameter per second. The moon is 3500Km in diameter. This would be some crazy 1% of light speed.
14284,bfThiqDd9FA,You would only see that if the moon was in the sky not space you can not see blackness of space day time so you would not see projectile coming from behind the moon.
14285,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jaykimbo2476 if it was big enough, it could reflect enough sunlight for it to be seen. But for this it had to be gigantic. (you can also see the moon)"

14293,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@feodiente9460 devastation is accurate maybe compared to earth, (& even then, with such a massive object travelling that fast, will create torrential destructions, a scale, several orders of magnitude more…) besides, that mushroom cloud would only occur in an atmospheric environment…a vacuum loc. such as the moon, would excrete debris in a straight path, having a cone/upside down triangle like trajectory"
14294,bfThiqDd9FA,@@OmarTheAtheistAziz well said..💯
14295,bfThiqDd9FA,Look at the little black speck below it looking to be pulling it
14296,bfThiqDd9FA,@@perrinaybara8551  A mushroom cloud. In practically zero atmosphere. Which is what makes mushroom clouds possible - as well as the whole slow motion look these clouds have in motion. Right... I believe in mushroom clouds on the moon. And in tin foil hats. /s
14297,bfThiqDd9FA,"What's the distance?  The sky is blue all around the moon.  Not black like you see in all NASA pics.  On the day of the ""moon landing"" the moon was in waxing crescent and they supposedly landed in the Sea Of Tranquility.  If that's the case it would have been dark where they were, but the sun was shining brightly according to NASA."
14298,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948 Where to even begin?
Do you know why the sky *on Earth* is blue during the day? No, it's not because of the sun. It's because the sunlight gets refracted in Earth's atmosphere. If it weren't for the atmosphere, the sky would be black.
Now, the moon has no atmosphere worth mentioning. (The occasional helium atom floating around on its way into seep space does NOT count.) So, there's nothing there to light up the sky around the moon during the day.
And while the moon was definitely waxing, it was nearly half-full. (I checked with three different sites.) which means that the Sea of Tranquility was most definitely in the light.
You really need to learn to check your ""facts""."
14299,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@melanien5599 It was crescent, which is NOT half full.  And I didn't say it was blue because of the sun.  I just noted that the sky all around the moon was blue."
14300,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948  It was an almost half-full crescent. At 42% full or some such. Still fitting the term ""crescent"", but far from a mere sliver of light only on the rightmost edge (as viewed from Earth). Once again: Check. Your. Facts!
And where did you get the idea that the sky all around the moon has to be blue??? Inquiring minds want to know."
14301,bfThiqDd9FA,@@melanien5599 Hi.  What's your email address?
14302,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@melanien5599 Well, it's blue during the day.  Okay, I stand corrected, but why are the shadows going from left to right on some pics, but right to left on others?  The sun would have been on the left side of the 42% phase."
14303,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wayniebob1948  Take a photo of a tree (or whatever else you please) when the sun is shining. See where the sun is in relation to the photographed tree. Now walk around the tree (or whatever your object of choice was) until you've walked half a circle. Take another pic of the same object. And - surprise, surprise! -  the sun is shining from the opposite side.
It's one of the many mysteries of photography. If you don't believe me, try it out with your phone camera.  I guess this just proves that someone must have been walking around on the moon. During the moon landing. Big surprise there!"
14304,bfThiqDd9FA,@@melanien5599 How profound!  The sun would still be shining in the same direction with the shadow pointing in the same direction.  Duh.
14305,bfThiqDd9FA,So oxygen is within the fuel and of course you can get thrust in space...@@tysonatkins2236
14306,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@tysonatkins2236 The oxygen is in the fuel itself.  If there is nothing to push against,  how would they be able to make trajectory corrections  en route to Mars?"

14424,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp 💡
14425,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone said what they loved about this video that everyone loves and I love that
14426,bfThiqDd9FA,I loved nothing about this faked video
14427,bfThiqDd9FA,tf does tht even mean… does it mean tht u voted for joe dead brain controlled by the elite to keep implementing the new world order and keep as much separation as possible? hmmm… fuckin christ save us from people like u @cashobuyer
14428,bfThiqDd9FA,Are you okay?
14429,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you guys
14430,bfThiqDd9FA,Whoever made this knows nothing about science…
14431,bfThiqDd9FA,That needs to be a big asteroid to see it from earth
14432,bfThiqDd9FA,I tona cementu poszła w czikaczunge.
14433,bfThiqDd9FA,"Almost every comment ;
I love how...... Blah blah blah"
14434,bfThiqDd9FA,This just discredits all of your uploads.
14435,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣 Se il video fosse durato 48 ore ci avrei potuto credere
14436,bfThiqDd9FA,And the camera in the parking lot can't see the license plate... What a time 🙄☝️😆
14437,bfThiqDd9FA,lol
14438,bfThiqDd9FA,you wont see dust cloud from that far
14439,bfThiqDd9FA,It's that tesla...
14440,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bro, you probably had bad marks in physics at school))) Looks like moon fart, not like impact."
14441,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this video and I also love cat videos ❤
14442,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh come on its...one punch man....Saitama having a fight against king boros
14443,bfThiqDd9FA,cap
14444,bfThiqDd9FA,Lol
14445,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is so big
14446,bfThiqDd9FA,And this is how rain clouds are made boys and girls.
14447,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is just there in the sky in this video
14448,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how people commenting, reading and liking everyone's comments."
14449,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🍅🍅🍅🍅
14450,bfThiqDd9FA,this shit looks terrible😂
14451,bfThiqDd9FA,No dust cloud in space bro
14452,bfThiqDd9FA,esto parece grafico por computadora o algo asi
14453,bfThiqDd9FA,It would take about 13 days for the sound to travel to Earth.
14454,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the life I live, I live the life I love."
14455,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how this has been loved by love,  allowing me to love all of this loving love"
14456,bfThiqDd9FA,I love comments
14457,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I don't love anything about this video.
14458,bfThiqDd9FA,There isn’t an atmosphere on the moon to compress dust into a mushroom cloud
14459,bfThiqDd9FA,Love
14460,bfThiqDd9FA,I love these lovely comments
14461,bfThiqDd9FA,I love life
14462,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you all are loving this.
14463,bfThiqDd9FA,Dammit Saitama!
14464,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro this is not possible because if any item or object crash on moon So it will not be seen to explode like this because there is no gravity.
14465,bfThiqDd9FA,"You were doing so well, but then tripped and fell over right at the very end."
14466,bfThiqDd9FA,@@JohnHazenhousen what? And why?
14467,bfThiqDd9FA,@@RiZZgamingYT1 ‘…because there is no gravity.’
14468,bfThiqDd9FA,The fact that this is actually 2.51 sec ago
14469,bfThiqDd9FA,the explosion was lagging a bit there.. you need to get a better GPU for your PC.. I mean... Camera
14470,bfThiqDd9FA,Me encanta ser el único idiota que habla español
14471,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love how some people can disassociate love from fighting for what they love , love means war against enemies of love"
14472,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that the cameramen was out taking selfies and decided to take pictures of the moon
14473,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that cell phone somehow magnifies the moon three times it’s normal size.
14474,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how I love how🤔
14475,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the love makes me feel loved
14476,bfThiqDd9FA,"This should have been biggest mass media story in last decade? Not a word? It's strange, we're able to see small debris at 230,000 miles away; give me a break. We might be able to see it, maybe less that 5,000 miles away, but almost 1/4 million miles away?"
14477,bfThiqDd9FA,I cloud how the love just spaces into moon.
14478,bfThiqDd9FA,4 march is my bday tho
14479,bfThiqDd9FA,Faster than light 🤣
14480,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon in noon. 
How it is possible"
14481,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the love is loved by the loving.
14482,bfThiqDd9FA,Es un vídeo más falso que un dólar de Miky Mouse.

14485,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to see many of the comments starts from 'i love'

14493,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this…
14494,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the thumbs down button not working??
14495,bfThiqDd9FA,That was removed like 3 years ago😭
14496,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone is commenting ""I love how..."""
14497,bfThiqDd9FA,Only noobs will believe on this..
14498,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣

14500,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you all
14501,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
14502,bfThiqDd9FA,This wouldn't be so stupid if the tree limbs weren't in the shot
14503,bfThiqDd9FA,"No, the moon is mad."
14504,bfThiqDd9FA,Nazis???? 😠
14505,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it when I come around and the noise yar girlfriend makes when I send you down the shop to buy some beer !..She really goes off !
14506,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much love is emphasized on this clip
14507,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate this video
14508,bfThiqDd9FA,AHHAHAHHHAAH
14509,bfThiqDd9FA,"What a load of absalutle fakery,"
14510,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how it is billowing like it has an atmosphere lmao 🤣
14511,bfThiqDd9FA,"Might want to get better video manipulation skills...  Better yet, get a life..."
14512,bfThiqDd9FA,Fable
14513,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you got the perfect video of my Anaconda slamming into the moon with flight assist off while I was showing off for my video on how not to crash into unlandable bodies in Elite Dangerous after dropping out of supercruise.
14514,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how we actually can see the rocket with naked eye
14515,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.

😂🤣"
14516,bfThiqDd9FA,😳😹😹😹😹
14517,bfThiqDd9FA,I love
14518,bfThiqDd9FA,9 fps
14519,bfThiqDd9FA,I love your mom
14520,bfThiqDd9FA,Can anybody tell me the Consequences of the impact ?
14521,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you 😘
14522,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how im breaking the “i love” chain in the comments
14523,bfThiqDd9FA,Shit looked like a acme cloud
14524,bfThiqDd9FA,Eso fue un globo chino que perdio el rumbo...jjjjj
14525,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
14526,bfThiqDd9FA,I love everything everyone wrote about this LMAO.  I need a good laugh
14527,bfThiqDd9FA,I’ve never seen moon this big in the morning
14528,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, that's a bit of a dust cloud"
14529,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you know What hit the moom?
14530,bfThiqDd9FA,I love thia Video
14531,bfThiqDd9FA,Poor graphics
14532,bfThiqDd9FA,Efect
14533,bfThiqDd9FA,this is number 1 bullshit
14534,bfThiqDd9FA,Not even Captain Disillusion would waste his time on this.
14535,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't think so
14536,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahahahahahahahaha
14537,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this
14538,bfThiqDd9FA,Que montagem mais porca…
14539,bfThiqDd9FA,explosion 😱💣
14540,bfThiqDd9FA,I love… too
14541,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah because someone just happened to be standing in the perfect spot to be clear of those clouds.. filming the moon in daylight because... There is where it falls apart. There is no legitimate reason for anyone to be filming the moon including the perfect angle and squared up scene. So anyone want to pretend they have a good reason to stand filming the moon all day just drop those reasons in the reply box
14542,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cupcakes
14543,bfThiqDd9FA,I love moon
14544,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments
14545,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how slow it’s exploding
14546,bfThiqDd9FA,"What is strange is ""I love how"" machines below to confuse us."
14547,bfThiqDd9FA,Heard of moon walk? Here's a lunar fart...
14548,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is made of cheese
14549,bfThiqDd9FA,Humor me
14550,bfThiqDd9FA,I love L.A.
14551,bfThiqDd9FA,since when everyone became so loving??
14552,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to see the Moon is so bigger than normal
14553,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people love people who love people. Beautiful🤍
14554,bfThiqDd9FA,Ohio clips
14555,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust clouds had 80 ping
14556,bfThiqDd9FA,i love that we can see the moon cleal in daylight for some reason
14557,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate this video 🤣
14558,bfThiqDd9FA,I love my jockey shorts yellow in the front and brown in the back.
14559,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love love love
14560,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon caught lackin
14561,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahahahahaha
14562,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how humans are like cattle for the wrong reasons
14563,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the comment section goes lmao 😂
14564,bfThiqDd9FA,It happened on my birthday and I didn't even know this
14565,bfThiqDd9FA,What a fantastic imagination.
14566,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we are still taking this Crap !!
14567,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that everyone here is continuing the love story
14568,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the unsolicited sarcasm each of the comments contain. 👏👏👏🤣
14569,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
14570,bfThiqDd9FA,Rotflmao
14571,bfThiqDd9FA,All the commentators are bot lovers 😆
14572,bfThiqDd9FA,Correct!
14573,bfThiqDd9FA,So many plot twists I just forgot mine
14574,bfThiqDd9FA,0:18 Someone informed to US that taliban is living on the moon and then..💥💥💥
14575,bfThiqDd9FA,Potato
14576,bfThiqDd9FA,funny wath people do for Subcribes. And I think the normal peoples have no IQ !!!! XD
14577,bfThiqDd9FA,I love everyone in this comment section.
14578,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this proves the moon is local to us and not 238 thousand miles away.
14579,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao this uses the exact same bird sound loop my gf uses to fall asleep
14580,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you. Each of you.
14581,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro nice capcut template 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
14582,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody starts off by saying I love how .I love that
14583,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest thing ever
14584,bfThiqDd9FA,I love lamp
14585,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mil mensajes diciendo ""i love how"" puros bots"
14586,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you forgot to set your frame rate to the same frame rate as the rest of the video. Just get it right before you work on the marvel movie.
14587,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how so great the video is
14588,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact was so immense that the frame rate of the dust cloud didn't even match the original video
14589,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's just some lag, no biggie."
14590,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂
14591,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the impact is right on the edge of the moon as we see it, so the explosion doesn't interfere with it."
14592,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is a conspiracy from China to wipe Neil Armstrong's footprints with a nuclear warhead in order to claim the moon for themselves, which in the end is nothing more than a big while balloon floating in the sky, but without cameras (yet)"
14593,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how everybody loves something about the video but not the video itself
14594,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they exactly know when to capture this iconic moment
14595,bfThiqDd9FA,I love ❤ how the moon 🌙 farts white ⚪ immediately
14596,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust expands at 12 fps
14597,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why the dust disappear just a few second after the impact ? There is no dense atmosphere on the Moon, so the dust should stay visible for a long period, not just a few second !!!"
14598,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE
14599,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that this is not a thing.
14600,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon was trying to dodge but failed
14601,bfThiqDd9FA,was it 43T hit?
14602,bfThiqDd9FA,"i hate, how everyone is repeating,""i love...""this n that"
14603,bfThiqDd9FA,I love these comments 😂😂😂
14604,bfThiqDd9FA,Joker
14605,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the fact that you all should watch Brave Girls - Goodbye MV 😁
14606,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the rocket said ""it's moonin' time"" and smacked the moon."
14607,bfThiqDd9FA,"Can totally vouch for this. Was about 250 miles away, just stepped out of the landing module for a smoke when all of a sudden - there it was. Never forget it."
14608,bfThiqDd9FA,"Congratulations. You are the only person in the comments section that didn't start with ""I love how...""  Lemmings."
14609,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the sound off bird whole time..
14610,bfThiqDd9FA,"мне нравиться новый МЕМ ""мне нравиться"""
14611,bfThiqDd9FA,That wasnt a dust cloud that was hundreds of thousands of Chinese dude covid breath air that all took turns blowing up that balloon.  Now we have China air here
14612,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how 99 percent of the comments start with I love how 🤔
14613,bfThiqDd9FA,This is cinema
14614,bfThiqDd9FA,Cg
14615,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the year NASA blew up a alien civilization on the on the moon
14616,bfThiqDd9FA,But I thought the cow jumped over the moon. Stupid cow.
14617,bfThiqDd9FA,I died laughing the little explosion cloud was soo cute
14618,bfThiqDd9FA,Nahh the rocket said “JIMMY WAIT FOR ME”
14619,bfThiqDd9FA,I love myself
14620,bfThiqDd9FA,I love mac and cheese.
14621,bfThiqDd9FA,look how choppy the explosion was plus you wouldn't see the object that's about to hit it the only reason you see the moon is because it's bigl enough to bounce sunlight to earth of itself
14622,bfThiqDd9FA,Something that big hitting the moon would move it. At least that's my opinion.
14623,bfThiqDd9FA,Any extinctions?
14624,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how despite this being on of the largest explosions ever recorded the brave camera man has zero reaction to the disaster
14625,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust and debris plume just all of a sudden disappears.  Where did it all go??  😂😂😂
14626,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you blamed the Chinese for this
14627,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm different.
14628,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely faked. Good one.
14629,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how watching this video really makes me love how watching this video really makes me love how
14630,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the rocket hit yer mum
14631,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how im late to this i love how
14632,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how YouTube suggested this to me knowing id watch and then feel tricked
14633,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it i love it i love it i love it i love it😂😂😂😂😂i love the way I love the moon i love the sky i love the clouds dust😂😂😂😂😂
14634,bfThiqDd9FA,No worries. Boros just knocked Saitama into the moon.
14635,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon ripped one 😂😂
14636,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love, exciting and new, come aboard, we're expecting yoooooou!!!"
14637,bfThiqDd9FA,I love going through the comments.
14638,bfThiqDd9FA,i love you all
14639,bfThiqDd9FA,Mais oui c’est clair
14640,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that i missed that event and be informed through this video
14641,bfThiqDd9FA,rocket travels at 30 FPS.. dust cloud expands at 5 FPS jjajjajaj
14642,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how another ‘object’ appears out of thin-air just before impact.
14643,bfThiqDd9FA,everything else is not lagging from the camera but the dust cloud is going like 5 frames a secone
14644,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud expanded in vacuum as if it was in an atmosphere
14645,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that's my favorite part
14646,bfThiqDd9FA,true
14647,bfThiqDd9FA,"It does indeed! Because the kinetic energy accelerates the dust particles, and they are getting attracted by each other creating sort of turbulences. There are several experiments proving it. BUT in this video OMG It's behaving like in air or fluid!"
14648,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how an object at that speed would’ve shattered the moon
14649,bfThiqDd9FA,Esatto🎉
14650,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people believe we can have an atmosphere in a vacuum with no barrier 😂
14651,bfThiqDd9FA,"Noone questions how we can have a sea without a barrier but a sea of air in a vacuum is impossible? Things don’t turn weightless in a vacuum, so any particla will be attracted to the nearest body. That is how we can have a atmosphere in a vacuum, because just like the air won’t pull the water out of the sea, the vacuum can’t pull the air out of the atmosphere. There is no force counteracting that the gases stays on the planet, other than possibly solar wind from which we are protected by earths very powerful magbetosphere."
14652,bfThiqDd9FA,Npc
14653,bfThiqDd9FA,@@scottd7222 ... I love how your tiny little brain can't comprehend how that is exactly how it is.
14654,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@scottd7222First of all, space isn't a vacuum. Secondly the atoms in the Athmosphere decrease gradually so there's no hard 'border' to space"
14655,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@dabigfreezeshattered not sure
14656,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
14657,bfThiqDd9FA,The people who faked this video should have considered that there would be some viewers who understand science.
14658,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
14659,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the clouds are pushed back just a little so we could have a good visual... and a tree for a good perspective.
14660,bfThiqDd9FA,What don’t you love about this ?
14661,bfThiqDd9FA,poor moon :(
14662,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Joe is my Mama
14663,bfThiqDd9FA,Good try… keep working on your special effects career!! You do need to do a little research on what that would actually look like!!😂😂😂😂😂
14664,bfThiqDd9FA,A lot of love in the comments ❤
14665,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how you all love something
14666,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone else is loving
14667,bfThiqDd9FA,"🥹🥹 I wanna join the love train TOOOO.❤ 🚆 who's the trend setter?? Wait I got one...""I LOVE 🤭🤭how someone has that much time on their hands to create this video and start a love trend hehe"""
14668,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there's a Shiba Inu dog face in the dust cloud if you put it on 0.25x speed.
14669,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many likes this comment gets and people come over to my channel to check it out 😀
14670,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
14671,bfThiqDd9FA,Who knew moon dust could rise that high and disappear just like a fart in the wind. No debris field either huh?
14672,bfThiqDd9FA,💩 poop
14673,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how i love
14674,bfThiqDd9FA,Another balloon popped
14675,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon has about a 3500 km diameter. Which means this explosion went about 1000km from the surface. I also didn’t know that when explosions happen they go frame by frame so you can really see what’s happening🙄
14676,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
14677,bfThiqDd9FA,Good god that was a massive object. I think that would have probably fucked the moon up pretty good. That was MASSIVE gotta make stuff realistic at least.
14678,bfThiqDd9FA,Space me bird udh hi nhi sakti
14679,bfThiqDd9FA,That's Saitama
14680,bfThiqDd9FA,I love to fart
14681,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love...no I don't, I hate this video."
14682,bfThiqDd9FA,Cheap effect.
14683,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love how I love how I love how. 🤣
14684,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they just decided to record this violent act against the moon and not help.
14685,bfThiqDd9FA,I.... love too?.?.?.?
14686,bfThiqDd9FA,😆
14687,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud glows in the sunlight exactly like the actual surface of the moon
14688,bfThiqDd9FA,I love adobe.
14689,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves leaving a love comment about something they loved
14690,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate everything about this

When one day I heard visitors in the building adjacent from the other building . So, I played some of his music , while , what I heard was a couple of dudes going about their day. So they can enjoy his music while they was there . And a FEMALE out of the crowd said, "" HE ONLY PLAYING 2 PAC, BECAUSE WHERE LISTENING OR HE ONLY PLAYING 2 PAC BECAUSE WHERE HERE""!

14742,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how it moves at 2 frames per second.
14743,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in the comment section started their sentence with I love how. . .
14744,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahaha this is so bad its funny to watch. The moon is like 500% bigger and that dust cloud?? OMG 😂😂😂

14757,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how…. (Crap, everyone has said everything. 😕"
14758,bfThiqDd9FA,i love reading the comment section after finding dumb videos on the internet

14772,bfThiqDd9FA,"not even the same FPS as the video, but 'neat'"
14773,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon would've been blown apart if that much lunar matter was ejected that far at that speed
14774,bfThiqDd9FA,This is just more evidence of how deranged morons of NASA are trying to destroy our world. Nothing else. These mentally ill deviants should have been consumed by Mother Earth long ago!
14775,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love reading comments under such spontaneous documents, where hundreds of thousands of idiots write about something that they will have no clue about until their fucking death... 😆"

14803,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this
14804,bfThiqDd9FA,Funniest thing ever XD clouds in space clearly visible from a phone camera
14805,bfThiqDd9FA,Вообще нечего не нравится. Херня какая то.
14806,bfThiqDd9FA,Why hasn't the moon cracked open already and dragons flying out of it. We all know the moon's a giant egg
14807,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how astroid collision happened fast as speed of light.
14808,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the dust just disappears like smoke would in an earth atmosphere
14809,bfThiqDd9FA,Just a normal fart nothing to worry guys
14810,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lmao! Okay, sure."
14811,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well done comet, but Youtube thumbnails plastered all over still defeated you."
14812,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the tiny mushroom cloud far behind the lose cotton clouds
14813,bfThiqDd9FA,They made the dust explosion move too quickly. Nice attempt though.
14814,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is so clearly visible during daytime
14815,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate that they forced me to believe that the earth was causing the phases of the moon!
14816,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is seen in the daytime 3 to 5 days EVERY month.
But NEVER a full moon."
14817,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@labbeaj Who forced you?
Was it the ""Jewish Free-Masons"" or the NASA Free-Masons?"
14818,bfThiqDd9FA,@@JasonSmith-jr7jh Teachers.
14819,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@labbeaj Meaning, the teachers ""brainwashed"" (unwittingly)
by said Zionists-NASA-Free Masons into teaching us the Earth 🌎 isn't Flat.
You sound like someone who believes in that Eric Dumbay 🐂...."
14820,bfThiqDd9FA,@@JasonSmith-jr7jh I stopped believing because it's the opposite knowing.
14821,bfThiqDd9FA,"I vant to b'leeeeeeve you.  But I don't, sowwy."
14822,bfThiqDd9FA,Now i know how clouds form!!
14823,bfThiqDd9FA,Where is other locations? :D
14824,bfThiqDd9FA,;D
14825,bfThiqDd9FA,wtf ? xD xD xD
14826,bfThiqDd9FA,"Okay, but I haven't got moon dust in my eyes yet, I'm still waiting 😂😂"
14827,bfThiqDd9FA,1. The speed wasn't fast enough to create a gas cloud that high and 2. How bright the blue sky is right now during the day you should not be able to see the gas cloud at all. There's the proof
14828,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope this is a joke right?
14829,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon is so bright for daytime
14830,bfThiqDd9FA,¿Saitama?
14831,bfThiqDd9FA,the debris from the crash traveling at half light speed.
14832,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro March 4 is my birthday
14833,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the crash looks like the Hiroshima bomb
14834,bfThiqDd9FA,"When I grow up...I want to become an astronaut....just so I can debunk this video,,"
14835,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone thinks they know everything about nothing...
14836,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone else  feel like the moon was moving?
14837,bfThiqDd9FA,Georges Méliès would have liked this video
14838,bfThiqDd9FA,I love nothing
14839,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that the consumer is now the producer and the consumer
14840,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the Cloud from the Impact just runs with like 50% of the Framerate from the Rest of the Video
14841,bfThiqDd9FA,I love Rice and beans
14842,bfThiqDd9FA,DAMN HOW DOES THIS CAMERA HAVE SUCH A GOOD VIEW OF THE MOON
14843,bfThiqDd9FA,II love how we all love how
14844,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣😂🤣😂🤣

14849,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how all these comments are bots, all starting with ""I love how...."""
14850,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember this incident. I was very young at that time.
14851,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud billowing through the moon's atmosphere is pretty.
14852,bfThiqDd9FA,"If the moon blew up, that would be a different story."
14853,bfThiqDd9FA,the Chinese spy balloon was set on a lunar impact trajectory by F-22 Raptor AIM-9 sidewinder missile
14854,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't be so harsh 🤣
14855,bfThiqDd9FA,🤡
14856,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the almost full moon appears to be in the sky at noon. 😂 
Maybe we gained another sun recently and night doesn't exist anymore?
Full moon with daytime clouds and sky lighting. Haha"
14857,bfThiqDd9FA,This guy should do computer Generated effects
14858,bfThiqDd9FA,"did you know, moon has no athmosphere ... -_-"
14859,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see this tiny chunk of space junk but never any other chunks of space junk
14860,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it just comes out of the cloud.
14861,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how the dust cloud suddenly dissipated/disappeared like it would have in an atmosphere, carried away by a wind.  It did not continue radiating outward."
14862,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, but why not love it?"
14863,bfThiqDd9FA,Just Chuck Norris fighting the moon.
14864,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s called Lunar Flatulence, I’m pretty sure and fortunately it’s not facing us! 👃🤢"

14922,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you love that! Crazy because I love it too!
14923,bfThiqDd9FA,"In earnest, it seems to be the way nowadays to describe something ironically and with a certain disdain. Maybe one day 'I love how' suffers the same fate as 'literally', which has become its own antonym - for being used too often ironically. Similar to 'I have a theory' that rendered from an ironic remark for 'I have a hunch' to being understood as admission of utter cluelessness... 'But it's ""only"" a theory'."
14924,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love
14925,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you noticed how much people love things about this video ❤

14980,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it how everyone loves something about this
14981,bfThiqDd9FA,Its bullshit. Even NASA's camera's are that good. Cause every pic NASA has  of shit is blurry. And why is the moon so close  to earth. Pure bullshit
14982,bfThiqDd9FA,Now we know it was a balloon!!
14983,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love!
14984,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is a copied comment but in my words and it is true..

14995,bfThiqDd9FA,You wouldn't love it if this junk returned to America unless it wiped out Hollyweird 😂.
14996,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is almost every story starting off with I love 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
14997,bfThiqDd9FA,how come the impact forms a cloud when there is no atmosphere.
14998,bfThiqDd9FA,You could say the “clouds” werent really clouds just moon dust
14999,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cloud went from reasonable size to what the shit? So fast
15000,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love the fact that the formed cloud looks like moon had a dense atmosphere. Amazing, every day something new!"
15001,bfThiqDd9FA,The was the impact cloud of One Punch Man getting punched to the moon. Or Ralph Cramdon knocking Alice to the moon.
15002,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's just what happens when you try to parallel park on the dark side of the moon, it's really crowded there."
15003,bfThiqDd9FA,You just happened to be filming the moon at that time hahahaha
15004,bfThiqDd9FA,Legends say the dust cloud formed its own galaxy and this is first time we are witnessing it this close!!!

15009,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the camera was just causally waiting there for something to happen 😂
15010,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why all of the comments start off with ""I love how"" kinda weird lol"
15011,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you but you don't love me😢

15013,bfThiqDd9FA,Jolie montage 🤣👍
15014,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the clouds stay the same but the camera shakes
15015,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
15016,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
15017,bfThiqDd9FA,If everyone had this much love the world would be a much better place.
15018,bfThiqDd9FA,😅🤣🤣🤣
15019,bfThiqDd9FA,It proves to you the propensity of people to repeat what they hear. Thought process too cumbersome. Too complicated. It’s so much easier to be unoriginal.
15020,bfThiqDd9FA,Yup!❤😂
15021,bfThiqDd9FA,"Creo que es más impactante un golpe de meteoro en la luna por no tener atmósfera densa, un impacto similar sería menos destructivo en la tierra"

15024,bfThiqDd9FA,WOW!  I was way more entretained by the comments!  . Good job all !
15025,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love
15026,bfThiqDd9FA,What a b.s. clip
15027,bfThiqDd9FA,No way a rocket could crash at almost the speed of light like what bro. And bro how in the stinkin' world did that explosion dust cloud grow so fast like bro what. How could you see a rocket like that at daytime?!? How could it be so big it can fit into 9 or 16 pixels in the camera bro. That was huge supermoon at daytime my man. 🤣🤣🤣
15028,bfThiqDd9FA,and i like the low fps cloud. crapfake. noob 👎
15029,bfThiqDd9FA,"The so called object moved so fast that's ok, but the designer forgot to calculate is that the impact cloud moved so fast as if it's happened 50 km away, even at the 50km distance the clouds will appear static... nice try... next time calculate dynamics of physics..."
15030,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, you can hear the impact as it happens from that far away. BS."
15031,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how sound can travel without medium aka vacuum and cover this distance with a speed of 50 000 km/s instead (2000x faster than its theoretical possible in the fastest medium!) 🤣
15032,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicht echt!
15033,bfThiqDd9FA,It seems like moon is farting
15034,bfThiqDd9FA,Can we try that 1 more time?
15035,bfThiqDd9FA,How did you create this?
15036,bfThiqDd9FA,"Dust covers almost half the moon 
Interesting 🌚"

15047,bfThiqDd9FA,I can't believe that the moon is in the morning
15048,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much of a bullcrap this really is
15049,bfThiqDd9FA,"Later 2023 moon: why I'm super far away of earth I want to be close of it I wanna save earth just like Jupiter did

Jupiter: wdym I got hit by a big explosive astroid that sends out 1m bons to end earth on my great red spot"
15050,bfThiqDd9FA,i like the air resistance that made the cloud roll like that instead of flying out with no resistance like stuff in space does

15087,bfThiqDd9FA,I love you.
15088,bfThiqDd9FA,We wouldn’t even that that from earth with the naked eye because the moon is too far for us to see any definition so would an asteroid hitting the moon
15089,bfThiqDd9FA,It would literally come off its orbit if it was that big. And it would mess with our orbit and the wobble of the earth. Plus the seas would LITERALLY go crazy right off the bat.
15090,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny.
15091,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments begin with I love how...
15092,bfThiqDd9FA,I notice nobody has asked how the Moon feels about all this.
15093,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how something visible to the naked eye in the daytime and as far away as the moon didn't create a blinding flash.
15094,bfThiqDd9FA,"So the moon farted, big deal."
15095,bfThiqDd9FA,Per accadere questo la luna avrebbe dovuto avere un diametro di pochi km e altrettanta distanza. Non si può mai vedere una nuvoletta di quel tipo a 300mila km
15096,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit

- Yes."

15100,bfThiqDd9FA,If we are living in the year 1920 and watching this video than we would've believed it but sadly we are living in 2023 so i would like to say i am sorry to believe
15101,bfThiqDd9FA,It's crap like this that makes YT and tictok horrible.
15102,bfThiqDd9FA,Unbelievable

15129,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG!!!!!😮 when in the hell did this happen? O that's right I seen it on Fox News and News Max. Thank God for the accurate news they bring us. Fox said it was ballots for Donald Trump that Democrats sent into space causing Trump to lose. That's messed up.
15130,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how…
15131,bfThiqDd9FA,I would expect the dust to rise and fall outward from the impact point and back onto the moon in parabolic fashion since there is no atmosphere on the moon to cause the dust to suspend in a cloud like that.
15132,bfThiqDd9FA,god damn moon what the hell you been eating taco bell?
15133,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣 moon gas
15134,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how your all saying the same thing sheeple

15200,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud expands like it’s in atmosphere
15201,bfThiqDd9FA,"exactly, in vacuum it expand like a giant sphere."
15202,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon IS in our atmosphere. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to see it. Just like the stars are in our atmosphere. There is a firmament, as it is described in the Bible, which surrounds the earth and protects our atmosphere (and us) from various debris from other planets, although the Bible never confirms that there are any other solar planets. The earth's firmament is the reason why we can be certain that no one will ever actually be going to Mars or that we will never be invaded by aliens from another planet. 

This video is capturing a star crashing into the moon, in my opinion, and the Bible tells us that the stars are ANGELS. So, the moon would be where the fallen angels reside (on the dark side and inside). Many blessings on your journey to the truth of our existence. The truth is in the Bible, not in 'space,' as there is actually no such thing in my opinion. NASA is simply Lucifer, that adversarious fallen cherub's, brain child. 

There is a Creator and His angels, and there is Lucifer and his angels. And the latter are in control of the MOON, which is why humans have never been back to the moon since the (supposed only) moon landing. Question everything, my friend. Time is running out.🕊"

15215,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Redeemer_80 I believe facts, not fairy tales"
15216,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@Redeemer_80 I love how 
1. The bible never mentions the earth's shape
2. the bible never specified the moon is or isn't in space
3. people knew the moon was in space before NASA existed
4. people knew the shape of the earth before NASA existed
5. other religions exist"
15217,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Redeemer_80he Moon is not in space ?
And the Earth is flat ?

Sometimes I can’t believe it too ,364.000km and we can see details on moon with just looking in the sky.
It looks so near,but I think it’s the atmosphere,works like a telescope lens."
15218,bfThiqDd9FA,"Talking with flat earthers is a waste of time. They are lost in the Bible and afraid of the fact that we are a tiny roc orbiting the sun.. They are lost.
May the force of the universe forgive them 🙏😂"
15219,bfThiqDd9FA,Amen
15220,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments start with I love how.
15221,bfThiqDd9FA,because they're certainly by the admin itself😂 i love the way he writes each time
15222,bfThiqDd9FA,Stupid ppl making crap
15223,bfThiqDd9FA,"According to my calculations and angles, the dust blow  before the impact! 😂"
15224,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why is everyone saying ""i love how..."""
15225,bfThiqDd9FA,because they're certainly by the admin itself😂 i love the way he writes each time
15226,bfThiqDd9FA,"I absolutely love how this phenomenal event has impacted my life, causing me to live in a lunar hell, each time I step outside. 

Makes me want to bark at the moon, all day, every day."
15227,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that switching to geico saved me 15% on my car insurance
15228,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is united in sarcasm 😄
15229,bfThiqDd9FA,Cute video 🤭
15230,bfThiqDd9FA,"The main thing here is the sheer size of the object, considering our distance from the moon. There is no way on God's green Earth somebody made something that big and sent it into space."
15231,bfThiqDd9FA,This is faker than my girlfriend
15232,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a cloud
15233,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a cloud
15234,bfThiqDd9FA,Totally bull
15235,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how y’all say I love how

15239,bfThiqDd9FA,Somebody forgot about the laws of physics
15240,bfThiqDd9FA,Come balla però è affascinante.
15241,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the camera was pointing exactly where it needed to be and the exact time something completely random was about to happen
15242,bfThiqDd9FA,"I mean, if there really was a rocket part up there on its way to crashing on the moon, we'd know when and where to look because that's how we found out about it to begin with......critical thinking wasn't something your parents taught you, huh?"
15243,bfThiqDd9FA,Well to be fair if a super massive asteroid were headed towards the moon we'd probably know about it
15244,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
15245,bfThiqDd9FA,"Honestly, that was the most believable part about the video. Plenty of folk have access to decent cameras and cameras that attach to telescopes. Its not hard to imagine some of them record the moon all day."

15251,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's not really a random event because there are enough institutions that monitor meteorites, comets and asteroids every second because they could also hit earth. They're not only calculating where but also when these things could potentially hit."

15254,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many comments are on here starting with I love
15255,bfThiqDd9FA,Oops.
15256,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how dust cloud lagging (dual core cpu)
15257,bfThiqDd9FA,"OK 👍 Time for NASA to chime in on this one. I thought you couldn't 👀 a plume, on the moon as there's no air ? ."
15258,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is really happened guys, I find the article.
Part of a rocket, weighing three tons, is thought to have smashed into the far side of the moon at approximately 12:25 p.m. GMT (7:25 a.m. ET), moving at an expected speed of 5,800 mph. (Because of the location of the impact, it could take days or weeks to confirm with satellite images.)"
15259,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud hat like 15 frames per Seconds when expending

15270,bfThiqDd9FA,A 8 bits moon needs a 8bits colision
15271,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty cool tho. Good job
15272,bfThiqDd9FA,me pregunto porque esta la luna en el dia
15273,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is inside the firmament. We see it every day. The sun too. Here, we clearly see an attack on the moon to take it out of orbit, but God."
15274,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazzzzyyy
15275,bfThiqDd9FA,I just love how all the comments are about what people love.

15283,bfThiqDd9FA,Nothing
15284,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the cloud acts like its in an atmosphere
15285,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
15286,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice After Effects.
15287,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty bad after effects the camera shake does not look good
15288,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the explosion occurs at a different frame rate compared to the rest of the video
15289,bfThiqDd9FA,fakery supreme
15290,bfThiqDd9FA,"90% of the comments start with ""i love.."""

15294,bfThiqDd9FA,The fact that frame rate of the due cloud is slower than the rest of the video 😂

15313,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how beautifully it is edited 😍
15314,bfThiqDd9FA,As the star crashed on the moon a tree was formed.
15315,bfThiqDd9FA,nice photo shop
15316,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how large the moon is 😆 the camera is not zoom in because of the tree branches 😆
15317,bfThiqDd9FA,I went on the comments and I think that's why aliens still ignoring us.
15318,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice editing skills. If only you had put that talent and skill into something beneficial, as opposed that trying to fool people.  People ain't stupid dude. You da fool"
15319,bfThiqDd9FA,more like ''the moon farting video.''
15320,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how when it crashed into the side of the moon...bearing in mind, the sun and the moon can affect our weather patterns and our tide patterns the like, there was no fall out from this event!!
I also love like the camera guy was just standing there filming knowing what was going to happen!!
I also love the fact that we can do anything with CG I!!
Oh and that there was no notifications from NASA that a commet has hit the moon at such a force, that the blast and fall out could be seen from Earth!!
Oh yeah, and there was such clarity in this picture that one could assume people knew what was going to happen before the rest of the world!!
Oh and that the blast fall out did not linger or blow anything out from the moon into our orbit!! 🤦‍♀️"
15321,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how all the comments starts by ""I love how"" 😂"
15322,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how anyone can lie us.
15323,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves something about it
15324,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is visible at 1 PM
15325,bfThiqDd9FA,I love. I love love love love. Moon got what it deserves being out in the middle of the day.
15326,bfThiqDd9FA,too fast. or the moon is too small.
15327,bfThiqDd9FA,I love moon even better now.
15328,bfThiqDd9FA,Goku was micro sleep.
15329,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this is the first time I've heard about this.
15330,bfThiqDd9FA,i like the background sound
15331,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the tree in the corner has clearly been superimposed
15332,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I just randomly  stumbled upon this at 3am
15333,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama and Gaoru?
15334,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds had no care at all to what was going on and were just singing merrily!
15335,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you set your camera  before the ""impact"" occurs.  And I really love how bright the moon was in the middle of daylight. I just love everything! Especially your imagination and creativity, and it's a good thing. Don't let other people tell you otherwise."
15336,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this comment most of all!
15337,bfThiqDd9FA,Instead of the Minecraft movie we got this
15338,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the cloud is clearly pushing through a medium.
15339,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you have to say (I love how?) Before each comment.?
15340,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how...yes
15341,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I love things
15342,bfThiqDd9FA,This is why I don't like flying spaceships
15343,bfThiqDd9FA,The BS factor is bigger than Biden classified documents excuses
15344,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the dust cloud dissipates almost immediately, regardless of the vacuum of space. Very Sigma dissipation."
15345,bfThiqDd9FA,How come this wasn't on CNN? 🤔
15346,bfThiqDd9FA,UTTER BOLLOX
15347,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate how everyone in the comments loves.
15348,bfThiqDd9FA,Angle of the dust cloud and the moon are off
15349,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 nice try
15350,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon doesn’t have an atmosphere so the ‘plume’ would never happen
15351,bfThiqDd9FA,Esa nube de polvo que se se mueve a velocidades relativistas y sigue siendo blanco y frío 😂🤣 es una simulación nefasta.
15352,bfThiqDd9FA,"The smoke would be really flat on the ground of the moon, because he still has quite some grqvity"
15353,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everybody starting their comments with: ""I love"""

15361,bfThiqDd9FA,XD
15362,bfThiqDd9FA,That is crazy.
15363,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't know about the moon but the impact was catastrophic to around 14 million eyes who watched this video
15364,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he was filming the moon right when this happened
15365,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love Lamp
15366,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is visible and it's day time

15372,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how, ""I love how"", became a _typed_ meme for this vid.

15398,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG! I love how .....🤣🤣🤣
15399,bfThiqDd9FA,Low gravity and no atmosphere makes ejected matter trajectories much different. Photoshop 100%
15400,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you knew that was going to happen. Nice filming
15401,bfThiqDd9FA,"You won't get an Oscar for video editing, thats for sure 😂😂 Looks like the moon is farting FTL. Wish I had those capabilities. Oh man."
15402,bfThiqDd9FA,its waxing gibbous not new moon
15403,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh sure someone obviously holding the camera, mic is recording but zero reactions from the person filming😂😂😂😂"

15406,bfThiqDd9FA,the impact was so hard it crashed the fps of the dust
15407,bfThiqDd9FA,Earth is flat
15408,bfThiqDd9FA,🤭   someone doesnt know science.
15409,bfThiqDd9FA,Its like a Moon Durt
15410,bfThiqDd9FA,In 2009 nasa crashed a rocket into the moon to test for moisture. This has been done!! I'm sure not in this video. It was a cloudy day that 2009. But I remember a video from an observation satellite roaming around.
15411,bfThiqDd9FA,Video hai 30fps ka or rocket hai 10fps 🤣 Video pura fack hai. Kau ki main After effect chalana janta huu 🙂

g I love how?"
15419,bfThiqDd9FA,😅
15420,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
15421,bfThiqDd9FA,This is incredible! So weird how an asteroid comes close enough to hit the moon when it doesn't hold any life so it can take it but nothing like this happens on Earth where that's where all the life is.
15422,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the great editing
15423,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how you can see the full moon in plain day light…
15424,bfThiqDd9FA,Titi
15425,bfThiqDd9FA,Potty
15426,bfThiqDd9FA,I like it how it creates a mushroom cloud despite the fact that the moon has no atmosphere.
15427,bfThiqDd9FA,Good timing
15428,bfThiqDd9FA,such pattern shows moon must have thick atmosphere ...
15429,bfThiqDd9FA,I love chicken wings. But only if they’re not too spicy.
15430,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's a faked thing. You can't see such a small object some 384,000 km way by your naked eyes. You say as viewed from different location, how? It's just a single clip from one point? NASA doesn't have such a clip."
15431,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ich meine sogar, ich hätte den Einschlag gehört !"

15469,bfThiqDd9FA,LMAO good job
15470,bfThiqDd9FA,I❤️how moon dust fell from the sky and got in my eye giving me 30/30 vision but due to technology only being as advanced as 8K I had to drop a few drops of eye drop in my eye cause 8K looked like 720p
15471,bfThiqDd9FA,im truly sorry this thing effed up your eyes so bad. that sucks. csn maybe you get polarized or flip ups to help?

15492,bfThiqDd9FA,what thats telling you is theres supposed to be a volcano on the moon and since im telling you i expect you to put a volcano on the moon named after me
15493,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the birds chirping
15494,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart
15495,bfThiqDd9FA,you can easy see that its a animation
15496,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone else randomly video tape the moon for 43 seconds?
15497,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves it!!🤣🤣🤣
15498,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the creators on the moon make a 90's homer silhouette and the crash is his hat.
15499,bfThiqDd9FA,"Is this really happened there would be a glowing ""tail"" of white dust for probably 20iah years that would be 100% noticeable. The moon would look like a sperm."
15500,bfThiqDd9FA,Just how can you see the explosion which is millions of kilometer away clearly 😑
15501,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a lander from China actually
15502,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the the dust cloud is like 100 miles big and also how we can see the rocket that hit the moon
15503,bfThiqDd9FA,What is this garbage? If anyone actually believes this… get help.
15504,bfThiqDd9FA,Chinese military exercises
15505,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing someone just happened to be filming exactly when that happened!!

15514,bfThiqDd9FA,i was wondering what XD stood for. thanks.
15515,bfThiqDd9FA,Steven Spielberg would be proud I am sure!
15516,bfThiqDd9FA,It happened nine months ago but the bang has not yet been heard. Hahahahahahah

15524,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud becomes quarter of the moons size in just 1 second
15525,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
15526,bfThiqDd9FA,A quarter is a over statement
15527,bfThiqDd9FA,@Elmi Adam  big time. More like 5%.
15528,bfThiqDd9FA,@@mikeporter837 more like 20%
15529,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
15530,bfThiqDd9FA,My thoughts exactly: also no shockwave .
15531,bfThiqDd9FA,It's gas
15532,bfThiqDd9FA,@@cookie4009 no
15533,bfThiqDd9FA,@@cookie4009 It's not gas. It's bollocks.
15534,bfThiqDd9FA,Fascinating 😂
15535,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
15536,bfThiqDd9FA,"also with different frame rate, crazy space"
15537,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@ogmugarooo 25% IS a quarter.
15538,bfThiqDd9FA,Considering the moon is approximately as wide as the USA the dust cloud builds to 1/4 it’s diameter in a second… so the cloud alone is trans hypersonic. I mean that’s fast.
15539,bfThiqDd9FA,@@jordanrex4730 There wouldn't be a shockwave.
15540,bfThiqDd9FA,That was just Florida man flinging tater tots at the moon. He only ordered a 2 liter of Pepsi from domino's and they gave him tater tots instead.

15545,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@jordanrex4730thats a stretch
15546,bfThiqDd9FA,It could just be evidence that the moon is a lot closer than they want us to think it is...
15547,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@jordanrex4730 silly comment, the moon has a diameter of about 11 miles"
15548,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon Fart
15549,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my nightmares hit a new level after I watched this before going to bed
15550,bfThiqDd9FA,"youknow its scary when you start having nightmares before you go to bed. your in my prares, man."
15551,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@sustayne Thanks. Luckily, it does not happen every night."
15552,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone’s comment starts with I love
15553,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love that I came for the video, but stayed for the comments."
15554,bfThiqDd9FA,This would be believable if the moon was the size of a small city.
15555,bfThiqDd9FA,This video illustrates a similar problem seen in rogue one - that animators sometimes don’t understand the sheer scale of the things they’re animating…
15556,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the birds softly chirping in the background. It really adds to the realness of being on earth.
15557,bfThiqDd9FA,"Uh, I'm pretty sure your hearing moon birds, pal. Is it possibel you dont know this?"
15558,bfThiqDd9FA,Lolz
15559,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how someones face scrunches up in disgust when they bite into the chocolate covered peanut butter egg you gave them on Easter but it's really a chocolate covered hard boiled egg you made as a practical joke.
15560,bfThiqDd9FA,"It has been widely calculated that an object at the distance of the moon to be seen by the naked eye needs to be around 50-70 miles in size.  Thats a really big rocket we just saw ""hit"" the moon."
15561,bfThiqDd9FA,"but if you have a 10X zoom then it only haz to be 5-7 miles. still big, but a 100X zoom woyld probly take care of things"
15562,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds  are singing with zero f@ck given to this catastrophic event

15567,bfThiqDd9FA,"An impact so powerful, you can hear the thunderous impact from the vacuum of space in mere seconds."
15568,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon isn't as far away as claimed
15569,bfThiqDd9FA,@@MrJustesting evidence
15570,bfThiqDd9FA,"@MrJustesting  just because something appears close doesn't mean it is. The moon doesn't change its position based on conjecture. It may be hard to comprehend distances that far, but Eratosthenes did. In 276-194 BC Eratosthenes realized the Sun had to be directly overhead Syene, or at its zenith, on that day. He also knew the Sun was 7 degrees away from the zenith at Alexandria on the solstice (which happens to be about 1/50th of the circumference of a circle). Using simple geometry, Eratosthenes then showed that this implied that the distance from Alexandria to Syene was 1/50th of the Earth’s circumference. Using the rate that the average camel could travel, and the number of days that it took a camel to travel from Alexandria to Syene, he estimated that the distance from Syene to Alexandria was 5000 stadia. Since he had calculated this distance to also be 1/50th of the Earth’s circumference, then 50 times 5000 stadia yields 250,000 stadia for the Earth’s circumference. Now the stadium (singular of stadia) had different lengths in ancient times. Traditionally, it is assumed that there are 6 stadia in a kilometer (km), meaning that Eratosthenes found the Earth’s circumference to be about 42,000 km (26,000 mi.) The circumference of the Earth is just its average diameter, 7915 miles, times the number pi, where pi is 3.14159. This gives us about 25,000 miles for the Earth’s circumference. So Eratosthenes only missed the circumference by approximately 4 percent. This was truly remarkable precision for 2200 years ago."
15571,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro forget to say that it is speed up after the impact
15572,bfThiqDd9FA,It looked like wile E coyote ran into the moon
15573,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love how you tubers comments on this Video.

15580,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon doesn’t look so distinct like that in the daytime
15581,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust particle mov. Was a little too fast at that distance...made the moon looked like it was 20feet away. Slow it down on the precomp next time. Use easy ease key frames also. Graph editor.
15582,bfThiqDd9FA,Clouds in space? Yeah no.

15617,bfThiqDd9FA,"NOT A ROCKET - AN ASTEROID! That object was way too large to be a rocket it was an asteroid!  The diameter of the Moon is 2,159 miles; If we were to assume a rocket is 300 ft long and 25 ft wide, it's length would be 1/34,000th of the diameter of the Moon!  If the moon were the size of a basketball, the rocket next to it would be 1/50th of a millimeter long and 1/500th of a millimeter wide!  The length would be less than the width of the thinnest human hair! You wouldn't even see it! Human eye resolution is not that good!  This object was much larger!  More like 1/200th to 1/100th of a moon diameter or in other words ten to twenty miles in diameter!  Why are our NASA scientists and news media not stating the obvious, that this is not a rocket?  Also, eyeballing the velocity of this object it travelled one moon diameter in about 5 seconds which would mean it was moving about 2,159/5 miles per second (430 miles per second) or 1.5 million miles per hour.  The plume from this meteor impact rose about 500 miles in just seconds, an amazing event!"

This guy who was walking by that was Mute began telling people to call 911 so someone can investigate what happened. My uncle said that someone in a helicopter was near by and said  it was an asteroid that crashed on the moon. Luckily no one was hurt. My uncle said The guy on the helicopter was nice enough to sweep everything up and made sure the moon wasnt leaking any air or anything. God bless that guy in the helicopter. 🙏🚁"
15712,bfThiqDd9FA,that was me. your welcome
15713,bfThiqDd9FA,it is impossible because moon dont have an air .it is in  emptiness .that is vaccume and dust and sand in vaccume of air dont blowup
15714,bfThiqDd9FA,"What is this a natural occurrence or precision strike and you know there’s a war going on in the heavens between the evil Confederation and the righteous Federation of light, like Star Trek, Captain Curt is Jesus Christ,👆🏼😳🥳👑💫⚔️🌎🕎🥁💪🏼✌️🌎🌈🍻🥳🌞👑.          🖖🏻"
15715,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people don't realise that this was infact a booger that I flicked up at the moon 10 years ago.

15718,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how no serious astronomer has been hooked by the title and video thumbnail.

15722,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every Comment here starts with I love
15723,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon moves because of the crash force.
15724,bfThiqDd9FA,what? Do you think most of the time the moon would Not move after getting hit so hard? People are amazing. i know the rocket was not full of feul anymore buy the moment of impact but still. Think.
15725,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sustayne exactly. And very lucky for us.  A few extra pounds of feul 😉 would have knocked it away like a billiard ball.
15726,bfThiqDd9FA,wow it is perfectly edited
15727,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama

15739,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how we were able to see the rocket
15740,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how this is a behemoth crock of shit.  However, I did enjoy it.  Thanks!"

15749,bfThiqDd9FA,🙄🙄🙄🤔
15750,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like someone put baby powder on the moons butt hole…
15751,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how to watch this shit at this time in the night where people comments with I love how to...
15752,bfThiqDd9FA,Mais mentiroso que a mentira
15753,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice crash effect, what app did you used?"
15754,bfThiqDd9FA,This video is such unscientific bullshit that it should be used in a stand-up.
15755,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love video editing , you can bulshit anyone today"

15758,bfThiqDd9FA,cap bro look at the bottom left corner
15759,bfThiqDd9FA,What?
15760,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the comments on this video
15761,bfThiqDd9FA,rocket flying faster than moons orbit
15762,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not a single one of you mofos know anything about what it's like to land on the moon. You don't know how smoke acts on the moon.  You don't have a clue about the physics of the moon. You ain't been there, and you ain't going there. So quit acting like you know because you don't. Duh .."
15763,bfThiqDd9FA,What are you talking about? That people say that dust cloud is to big? It definitely is!
15764,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon has no atmosphere so the dust would fall back pretty quickly
15765,bfThiqDd9FA,That's not how this works 🤦🏼‍♂️
15766,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 so how it works?
15767,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jozkomrkvicka7607 it flys up and away, not make a cloud. Some of it would come down, but not after a long time."
15768,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@thecyanadon it depends on the Power of the Explosion if you do not reach escape velocity then it falls back. The moons escape velocity is ca. 8500km/h which was not reached, so it should fall down as quick as it went up."
15769,bfThiqDd9FA,"Space is amazing, look at that dust travelling at the speed of light almost - mind blown."
15770,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon farts.
15771,bfThiqDd9FA,Our first moon landing!
15772,bfThiqDd9FA,"Poor Millennium Falcon, turned out it was actually a moon... 🫤"
15773,bfThiqDd9FA,the dust cloud running at 10fps lmao
15774,bfThiqDd9FA,This defo is the most legit thing I’ve seen on the internet today
15775,bfThiqDd9FA,Rhat must of been a heck of an explosion.
15776,bfThiqDd9FA,How is that possible. There is not a single air molecule on space. :p
15777,bfThiqDd9FA,And?
15778,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 huh?
15779,bfThiqDd9FA,Is there anything more beautiful then a soft pair of butt cheeks?
15780,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Stand4Righteousness so cuddly? Hahaha
15781,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ravendude0507 are ur cheeks soft n cuddley?
15782,bfThiqDd9FA,@@BostonCream959 it can not make a cloud.
15783,bfThiqDd9FA,There would be a bright explosion like the shoemaker impact on jupiter. Also the reason for mushroom clouds on earth is our atmosphere. It would look more like firework on the moon.
15784,bfThiqDd9FA,I loved the smell of cheese in the air the next day !
15785,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes!!! All that time filming the moon for no apparent reason has finally paid off!!
15786,bfThiqDd9FA,"""Oh no, I forgot to turn on realism."""
15787,bfThiqDd9FA,the frames on the effect don't even line up with the rest of the video hahahahaha
15788,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how nobody can start a comment without saying ""I love how"""
15789,bfThiqDd9FA,Alternate title: Moon farts live on camera 📷
15790,bfThiqDd9FA,I have never witnessed so many stupid comments in one video!
15791,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the majority of commenters are following the unstated rule that their comment must begin with “I love…”
15792,bfThiqDd9FA,Edit
15793,bfThiqDd9FA,I think what we witnessed was the Coyote hitting the moon after the Road Runner shot him there with a giant sling shot.
15794,bfThiqDd9FA,I Hate this Clip
15795,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that 'rocket part' is several kilometers wide.
15796,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how love how comments are flooding this place 😴
15797,bfThiqDd9FA,😁 A non-atmospherically-choked explosion asset would have been more realistic.
15798,bfThiqDd9FA,Lolcool
15799,bfThiqDd9FA,I saw Russia from there.
15800,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he even saw the meteor that far away and knew to record this exact moment
15801,bfThiqDd9FA,He managed to calculate it was not behind or Infront of the big moon.
15802,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the cameramen 😂❤
15803,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like a fart
15804,bfThiqDd9FA,did the moon just fart?
15805,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom cloud in space?
15806,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice effect👍
15807,bfThiqDd9FA,video montaggio fatto bene ...peccato che se fosse vero  con un impatto cosi la luna avrebbe avuto un piccolo cambiamento di traiettoria molto pericoloso per noi
15808,bfThiqDd9FA,"Omg was that Ironman??
Oh and I love how I love him!"
15809,bfThiqDd9FA,I like turtles
15810,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice simulation
15811,bfThiqDd9FA,Not all the comments starting with “I love” 💀
15812,bfThiqDd9FA,I love love.
15813,bfThiqDd9FA,saitama crush the moon
15814,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait a minute. I thought the moon was about 283,855 miles from earth! Then how can you possibly even see something like this! We are not being told the truth!!!"
15815,bfThiqDd9FA,"You guys really love a lot of stuff, I love that"
15816,bfThiqDd9FA,Why tell us that was a rocket ???? The moon is coverd in creators from impacts of asteriods/comets so couldn't that of been a asteriod??? Its not a rocket why would we crash a rocket into the moon and who did it??? Also wouldn't a rocket come from earth I mean look at it it's hitting from the side of the moon from space ??????
15817,bfThiqDd9FA,Are you serious?! 😳
15818,bfThiqDd9FA,Is saitama in One punch man
15819,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣
15820,bfThiqDd9FA,That's pretty funny
15821,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a moon fart
15822,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ok so its a vacuum. There is basically no atmosphere on the moon, though it can be debated there is a tiny bit. The dust could in fact travel at insanely high speeds as there is no air, so nothing to slow even the smallest particles down. There would be no mushroom cloud though. Air causes the mushroom cloud to be able to form. It would look more like a giant splash. Like throwing a rock at a puddle."
15823,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how many people love so much about this clip... pity there wasn't  more love like this in day to day life.  With a love so great just think what we could do!!!    One love!
15824,bfThiqDd9FA,Total click bait
15825,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that Vegeta landing on moon?or Saitama?
15826,bfThiqDd9FA,How many I love how comments can u count ? Lmao
15827,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves something
15828,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone's such an expert on something like this beings it happens quite frequently
15829,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon [ IM GOOD NO WORRYS ITS JUST A FLY]
15830,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon's diameter (length from side to side) is about 3,500 km,
Therefore the rocket seen in here (something like a hundredth of the moon) should be 35 km wide"
15831,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess princess Luna got sentenced again!!
15832,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is talking about love ❤️
15833,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how a mushroom cloud formed in the vacuum of space
15834,bfThiqDd9FA,Why do you even post crap like this?.
15835,bfThiqDd9FA,One punch man 🤛
15836,bfThiqDd9FA,other videos show it circling the moon first- orbits the moon in 5 seconds- this one didn't at all?
15837,bfThiqDd9FA,What?!
15838,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how this video and my ex girlfriend tried to cheat on me.
15839,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket LITERALLY looked like a MICRO NUCLEAR BOMB  [lul]
15840,bfThiqDd9FA,"когда не осознаешь размеры луны и делаешь облако пыли в 500 км, летящее с околосветовой скоростью) вспышки, естественно нет, потому что на луне нет кислорода"
15841,bfThiqDd9FA,That poof was comical
15842,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that I enjoyed reading comments.
15843,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is united in their enthusiasm.
15844,bfThiqDd9FA,Haha
15845,bfThiqDd9FA,"And the cloud didn't disperse along the moon's surface, it just went up like a bomb that went off. Things like that don't even go that high up down here when they hit the ground unless it's a nuclear bomb."
15846,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice graphics but impossible!
15847,bfThiqDd9FA,To bad the ads pop up and block it
15848,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon at daytime.. wow. Where do you live 😂😂😂
15849,bfThiqDd9FA,That's actually possible
15850,bfThiqDd9FA,First undeniable evidence of legendary Moon Fart??
15851,bfThiqDd9FA,Is looks like Sentinel’s secret cargo plane landed over there but I’m not sure
15852,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how every comment starts the same
15853,bfThiqDd9FA,Интересно то что луна слишком близко
15854,bfThiqDd9FA,bro it's saitama crashes moon
15855,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣
15856,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we have not had any debris pass through our atmosphere. We should of had a significant meteor shower.
15857,bfThiqDd9FA,if this was in a game or something like tho it would be kinda heat
15858,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how there's no actual way dust could possibly travel that fast
15859,bfThiqDd9FA,Love nonsense and very common these days
15860,bfThiqDd9FA,"I also believe there is no way we would see a small rocket clearly hit the moon when the moon is almost 250,000 miles away. I’ve seen my fair share of launches and you can’t see the rocket anymore after a few minutes and considering it takes a few days to reach the moon I don’t think so."
15861,bfThiqDd9FA,A few days it takes 6 months to reach the moon from Earth
15862,bfThiqDd9FA,@@DreDre286 no it’s only 2.5 to 4 days to reach the moon with the current rocket systems. It takes 5-10 months with a 7 month average to reach Mars so you are mistaking the length of time to reach the moon with the length of time to reach Mars. Jupiter can take about a year and a half to two years to get to. They are much farther than the moon. Neil Armstrong and crew got to the moon and back in just a week.
15863,bfThiqDd9FA,@Call me by your name why would NASA kidnap some random people and hold them captive to film a moon video when they could just hire people and train them with their budget to not  reveal secrets and look scared on TV? What??
15864,bfThiqDd9FA,there is no air soo there should be no mushroom dust explosion or anything in the first place
15865,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@DreDre286um, no."
15866,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@DreDre286it's going from other side clearly not from earth
15867,bfThiqDd9FA,There was a storm in space with strong winds.
15868,bfThiqDd9FA,CAP
15869,bfThiqDd9FA,And………………….nope!
15870,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how realistic this looks…..
15871,bfThiqDd9FA,🤭 👍

15875,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all the comments start with I love how
15876,bfThiqDd9FA,Sorry for jerking off that hard.
15877,bfThiqDd9FA,I love sarcasm
15878,bfThiqDd9FA,"The gravity of the Moon is 1 sixth that of Earth's.   There is no atmosphere.  The resistance to the expantion would be miniscule.  
         The thing that makes obvious the video is faked is the mushroom cloud.
A mushroom cloud is formed after an explosion.   When the atmosphere rushes in, filling a vacuum  created by the explosion.   No atmosphere, no mushroom cloud.
  An impact would have a different signature cloud."
15879,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he/she edited this video😍
15880,bfThiqDd9FA,"I actually think it's pretty well done. I doubt that too many people would care to read that wall of text, though."
15881,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun stuff!!!
15882,bfThiqDd9FA,My favorite part about the dust cloud is that it’s more in focus than the rest of the moon
15883,bfThiqDd9FA,nice framedrops on the crash animation
15884,bfThiqDd9FA,Physics are way off. Looks like Wile E. Coyote and road runner are going at it on the moon...🤭
15885,bfThiqDd9FA,"Something if fishy
How come 99% of comments have same starting 😂"
15886,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody in the comments is writing I love how.
15887,bfThiqDd9FA,"many commenters here watch too many marvel movies, their mental line is blurred between reality and fiction"
15888,bfThiqDd9FA,"Too fast, the object is moving at 818km/s. The fastest man made orbiting object is 109km/s 
Too big, the object is 80km across. The largest man made object in space is the HSS which is 109m end to end.

To calculate the speed of the object; Object is moving 1 moon diameter in 4.25 seconds. Diameter of the Moon is 3475km divided by the time 4.25 seconds is 818km/s.
The diameter of the object is 43 times smaller than the moon(3475km), so that would make the object a massive 80km across.

If you want the speed of the cloud it is 434km/s, that's 0.144666667% the speed of light.
Moon diameter 3'475km
Dust cloud travelling 1/8th the diameter of the moon in 1 second 
1/8th diameter of Moon is 434km
That's 434km/s
Speed of light 300'000km/s"
15889,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon moved and he was able to see the object during the day.
15890,bfThiqDd9FA,Love easy
15891,bfThiqDd9FA,Mfw the dust cloud runs at 10fps
15892,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love to think that such an impact would make the moon fall apart in earth, bringing the end of times!"
15893,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone in coments says ""I love""!"
15894,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought the world was going to end
15895,bfThiqDd9FA,Gravity that can move oceans yet dust just flew off. Hmmm...
15896,bfThiqDd9FA,"Its an edit, the dust isnt expanding smoothly, it looks like a gif with only a few frames"
15897,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how....
15898,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how almost all the comments start with “I love how” 😅
15899,bfThiqDd9FA,🤡
15900,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is noticeably moving
15901,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love all these ""l love how..."" comments. 😅"
15902,bfThiqDd9FA,I love putting milk in the bowl first then my cereal.
15903,bfThiqDd9FA,I did not know that the stone I threw will impact the moon like this. This is heartbreaking.
15904,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the dust cloud is 1/10 the size of the whole moon
15905,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of BS
15906,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think the funniest thing about all of this s*** is how people actually believe they can see a rocket headed towards the Moon that close like really people????
So many people with no b******* if it slapped them in their face???"

15921,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon just farted
15922,bfThiqDd9FA,Was that a small meteor??
15923,bfThiqDd9FA,so thats how clouds are made......
15924,bfThiqDd9FA,Just so happens that the dust cloud is moving at around 10 fps while everything around it is 30-60 fps
15925,bfThiqDd9FA,Roskosmos - special landing operation on the moon. 🌚
15926,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon is not that close, This is just awesome visual effects"
15927,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does/ how does an object approach the moon from such a sharp sideways angle as opposed to colliding into the moon directly from above which is what any object would do under gravity. It would fall straight downwards and not travel downwards at an obvious sideways angle? This is bullshit unless the object was steered and propelled into the side of the moon which I think it was.
15928,bfThiqDd9FA,These videos are great!
15929,bfThiqDd9FA,No atmo on moon
15930,bfThiqDd9FA,I hate the fact YouTube removed dislikes because I'm the type of person who can't tell the legitimacy of this.

15951,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact is so small as compared to the intensity of the crash
15952,bfThiqDd9FA,Love what?
15953,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not only that but it's still so big you should've seen severe consequences on the surface of the moon with the crust turning molten where it struck and debris flying, yet you see none of that

But nah, huge object traveling at INSANE speeds toward the moon, crashes into it and causes an explosion not even half the size it should've but still strong enough to cause severe damage, and all you see is a plume of dust"
15954,bfThiqDd9FA,"People dont believe anything yet the same people are  so easly mislead they wont believe if god came down from the heavens they would say "" I love how the dust..... 😂"
15955,bfThiqDd9FA,One punch and
15956,bfThiqDd9FA,I love.
15957,bfThiqDd9FA,"Total crap,,,,,,,,,,"
15958,bfThiqDd9FA,"I luv how we forgot that China, Russia, and USA are going to war on Earth to fool the masses that we are enemies. Meanwhile, they are sharing technology and helping each other clone humans, build artificial moons to block the sun in near future. Remember USA saved southern China from Japan, Russia save Europe From Nazis, and the US, Middle East, Egypt allowed JEWS (JerusalemExiledWhiteSatanist) ""Flying carpet"". SMH, I pray the TRUE White brotherhood returns before they nuke us while they hide underground or on the moon."
15959,bfThiqDd9FA,jajajajaja. Did smoke form on the moon? . jajajaja
15960,bfThiqDd9FA,It's amazing that there are birds on the moon 🌚 🐔🕊️ 🐔
15961,bfThiqDd9FA,Jajajaja... que falso
15962,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can clearly see the “object” that hit the moon (like a plane or space shuttle) all the way down here on earth! 😮🙄
15963,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing
15964,bfThiqDd9FA,😁😁😁😁
15965,bfThiqDd9FA,The worst Photoshop I've ever seen
15966,bfThiqDd9FA,Clips like this prove we have some dumb people in the world that will fall for anything . They are the reason Satan exists. The truth about our world is NOTHING like you've been taught. All lies.
15967,bfThiqDd9FA,"This ""part"" has about 70km diament and speed 100000km/s. After this impakt Moon will evaporate."
15968,bfThiqDd9FA,"I always wondered if there was intelligent life out there,and now I know."
15969,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍 GREAT🤣🤣🤣🤣
15970,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it mushrooms in the moons atmosphere.
15971,bfThiqDd9FA,Why the moon is so big?
15972,bfThiqDd9FA,93.000 dislikes bravo!
15973,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
15974,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ahh yes the typical 17,000 miles per second dust cloud"
15975,bfThiqDd9FA,I LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE 😂
15976,bfThiqDd9FA,The point actually went behind the moon😁👍🏻
15977,bfThiqDd9FA,This is very bad CG.
15978,bfThiqDd9FA,the idea of providing a lie in the caption to get people to open it should not be allowed. IT is a shame that I have to even open it to notify you tube is wrong as it gives the impression that i am interested in this garbage
15979,bfThiqDd9FA,"The site is called ""ViralVideoLab"" for a reason..."
15980,bfThiqDd9FA,RIP moon.  🙏
15981,bfThiqDd9FA,Looney tunes landed on moon
15982,bfThiqDd9FA,Its a giant rabbit puffing on a vape
15983,bfThiqDd9FA,"What, no BOOM 1.5 seconds after impact?"
15984,bfThiqDd9FA,This is greenland like no night
15985,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon so big?
15986,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s a very good edit wow
15987,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just farted 💨
15988,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how everyone's comments start with ""I love how..."""
15989,bfThiqDd9FA,Stop lying you human!!!!! Next time make a better video because this is just insulting our sense with a poor TOM & JERRY clip
15990,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny
15991,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how 5 million people watched this
15992,bfThiqDd9FA,"A meteor landed on the moon i saw that
That's why it was a explotion there"
15993,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon farted
15994,bfThiqDd9FA,its sentinel prime
15995,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud is one frame per a second
15996,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how each comment starts with I love how
15997,bfThiqDd9FA,"No it's the re make of space 1999 .
 I hope to see a eagle interceptor
And moon base ALFA"
15998,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it also made the moon shift.  We all be freezing dead right now
15999,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted..
16000,bfThiqDd9FA,Comment section😂😂😂
16001,bfThiqDd9FA,kkkkkk very false because the moon does not appear during the day kkkkk dislikes for this video
16002,bfThiqDd9FA,Half of these comments basically use the same sentence. That being (i love).
16003,bfThiqDd9FA,Edit: (i love how)
16004,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing 😄😄😂😂
16005,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone loves how.
16006,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you guys love that
16007,bfThiqDd9FA,Lamo nice try chump
16008,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16009,bfThiqDd9FA,That must be a huge ass rocket if you can see it from earth hahaha even starlink flying in leo you can barely see it at night and lets not talk about the speed and the wrong angle of the dust cloud nice try tho
16010,bfThiqDd9FA,This is exzactly what we all watched on the news with the towers. Impossible to physics.
16011,bfThiqDd9FA,"Was that a supermassive nuke or something? I am not an idiot, there is no fucking way a small ass wannabe space junk rocket can cause such a big explosion."
16012,bfThiqDd9FA,"The dust cloud expands to 1/4 of the moons diameter in about 5 seconds.
That's roughly 175 km per second, or 626,000 kph (389,000 mph).
Even without an atmosphere, that seems a tad too fast."
16013,bfThiqDd9FA,bro there is no gravity in the moon
16014,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that I'm commenting here for no good reason.
16015,bfThiqDd9FA,After effects is good
16016,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon must have grown a much bigger atmosphere to hold that dust cloud in shape....
16017,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people see that thumbnail and go to see the video thinking is true.
16018,bfThiqDd9FA,I love this comment section
16019,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit though
16020,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakeness
16021,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the mushroom cloud is as big as florida
16022,bfThiqDd9FA,BRUH ITS WAY BIGGER THAN FLORIDA
16023,bfThiqDd9FA,i like how the cloud cuts in and out of frame. very realistic.
16024,bfThiqDd9FA,*love
16025,bfThiqDd9FA,xd Moon into te day
16026,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is loving and not hating in the comments section!  Happy holidays 😊❤️🎄
16027,bfThiqDd9FA,love how this video gets about 72% of dislikes.
16028,bfThiqDd9FA,"knowing that the moon is less visible during the day, this is definitely debunked. we are so far away from the moon, i highly guarantee we wouldn’t be able to see what’s happening on it"
16029,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the moon is so close
16030,bfThiqDd9FA,"great, they have contaminated the cheese."
16031,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon just sits there and takes it.
16032,bfThiqDd9FA,can you imajine if it moved out of the way at the last second? that would make me throw up .
16033,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@sustayne fax, but bro it's imagine 🤓🤓🤓"
16034,bfThiqDd9FA,I almost like it but 69 seemed so perfect for this comment
16035,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeap. Like your mom.
16036,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16037,bfThiqDd9FA,We all know that the moon is just the earth's bitch.
16038,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahaha😂
16039,bfThiqDd9FA,Like a good moon should
16040,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's why when you show your ass to someone, it's called a full moon"
16041,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is this my favorite comment so far?
16042,bfThiqDd9FA,"You speak truth and wisdom, kind Sir..."
16043,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
16044,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah sexy moon!!
16045,bfThiqDd9FA,"OK, this is the best comment! 😂"
16046,bfThiqDd9FA,@@FridayFroths .
16047,bfThiqDd9FA,Ha ha!Too funny
16048,bfThiqDd9FA,I dont think this was honey moon but both comments  & video are problably ai & yes its 1:11am central time but then i watch a lot of ufo $ or flying saucers on u tube
16049,bfThiqDd9FA,Like a boss.  What a legend.
16050,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you came up with that.
16051,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket that is the size of Rhode Island takes about 4 seconds to cover the diameter of the moon equating to roughly 2 million miles per hour.  Thats the fastest thing in the solar system by a couple orders of magnitude!
16052,bfThiqDd9FA,Fair point! Didnt think of that.
16053,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that how youtube's algorithm recommends the comments that have I LOVE THAT on top
16054,bfThiqDd9FA,Good montage
16055,bfThiqDd9FA,Best video editing ever seen
16056,bfThiqDd9FA,Which thing crashed wth moon
16057,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16058,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how these comments follow a theme.
16059,bfThiqDd9FA,bro GTA San Andreas goofy ahh moon 💀
16060,bfThiqDd9FA,Told ya the Moon is made of powdered sugar! 💋
16061,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice photoshop…..joke lib bs
16062,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is hilarious.  I genuinely cannot tell if this is actually meant to trick people for clicks, or just blatant trolling."
16063,bfThiqDd9FA,I was expecting an explosion sound...😂
16064,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cloud wouldn’t have looked like that and wouldn’t have disappeared that fast. This would have been all over the news and the size of that object would have destroyed the moon
16065,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust from the explosion suddenly vanished
16066,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice bullshit
16067,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try chump.
16068,bfThiqDd9FA,"""Just a another Normal day in ohio💀"""
16069,bfThiqDd9FA,Cmon guys. It's on the internet. It has to be true
16070,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how almost every comment begins with ""I love how""."
16071,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's pray
16072,bfThiqDd9FA,...bullshit...
16073,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how I actually clicked even though I knew better.
16074,bfThiqDd9FA,"🟩 A simple calculation of the size of the moon, and the proportions of the explosion, shows that the height of the ""mushroom of smoke"" was 980 kilometers.
My brother, even amateur cheaters wouldn't make such a mistake, so how can a professional cheater like you??!.."
16075,bfThiqDd9FA,"That was the hero for fun ""Saitama"", who's being kicked by Boros from his mother ship. 😉"
16076,bfThiqDd9FA,this is faker then the democrats
16077,bfThiqDd9FA,I love the default premire camera shake
16078,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon just farted
16079,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is so big
16080,bfThiqDd9FA,"Commander, the resupply ship just crashed.... the whole shipment of Moon pies has been lost! Damn it!"
16081,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's one big ""rocket part"" lmao...."
16082,bfThiqDd9FA,bro that’s just saitama from when he was fighting boros
16083,bfThiqDd9FA,Best editing 👌🏻
16084,bfThiqDd9FA,"Good VFX, but poor physics knowledge."
16085,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
16086,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
16087,bfThiqDd9FA,gmafb
16088,bfThiqDd9FA,Hay un poco de video en esa edición.. 😂
16089,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted!
16090,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that saitama landing on moon
16091,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart
16092,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice but since there is no atmosphere on the moon I think the mushroom debris cloud would be of different shape
16093,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
16094,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how we all keep saying I love how
16095,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud vanished as fast as it formed.
16096,bfThiqDd9FA,Good one... yeah right.
16097,bfThiqDd9FA,1. This had a completely different event that the other video 2. the puff of debris is not possible. 3. the other video was taken at night after dark.
16098,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how were all coming together to collectively roast this individual
16099,bfThiqDd9FA,Fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-FUHAAAAAAAAKE!
16100,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you all say I love how.
16101,bfThiqDd9FA,Only in ohio 💀
16102,bfThiqDd9FA,Yep... that's enough YouTube for today
16103,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people uses “ilove how…” for infinite times😂
16104,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it resembles a Jules Verne film clip.
16105,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how sometimes late at night it’s dark outside.
16106,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in this comment section are astrophycisits and professional video editors.
16107,bfThiqDd9FA,WOW! Phenomenal footage.
16108,bfThiqDd9FA,looks like moon farted
16109,bfThiqDd9FA,AND YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT MOON IS SO FAR AWAY 🤦‍♀️
16110,bfThiqDd9FA,Huh?
16111,bfThiqDd9FA,it is this is an animation
16112,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how huge the object crashing is.
16113,bfThiqDd9FA,There's no mushroom clouds in space.
16114,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
16115,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that the moon was full in the video even though 4th of march 22 the moon wasnt visible
16116,bfThiqDd9FA,check the 22th of March '04
16117,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@sustayne yes, it was not a full moon day, go check if im wrong or not 💁‍♂️"
16118,bfThiqDd9FA,The person who made this has absolutely 0 sense of scale
16119,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the dust cloud is in laggy 20 frames per second, and the rest of the footage is 60 frames per second."
16120,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love I love I love I love I love I love I love, is that all anybody knows how to start a sentence? Or are you all just copycats? No originality!"
16121,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oooh I saw this movie, it was transformers 3 Dark of the moon😂😂"
16122,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
16123,bfThiqDd9FA,Луна это космический корабль-лаборатория!
16124,bfThiqDd9FA,🛸💥🌛😱‼️
16125,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how meteor passed through the cloud hits blue sky and some how  disappears .
16126,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the Honey Badger beat Elon Musk to the Moon.
16127,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how “I love how” is so hot right now
16128,bfThiqDd9FA,Платонова
16129,bfThiqDd9FA,Es la misma nube que da el efecto visual con la luna .
16130,bfThiqDd9FA,That would have been a piece of a rocket that was roughly 30 miles long by 30 miles wide. Gee golly I’ve never seen any man made aircraft or spacecraft that big.
16131,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can hear the echo of the impact....
16132,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everybody loves to start their comment with I love how
16133,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't knew frame skipping was something nature could do.
16134,bfThiqDd9FA,Lots of love in these comments
16135,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts with ""I love how [obvious flaw]"""
16136,bfThiqDd9FA,Asteroid
16137,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon “reflects” light from the sun when the earth is in the way.
16138,bfThiqDd9FA,What?
16139,bfThiqDd9FA,There is something called a Lunar Eclipse where the Earth actually Does block out the light from the Sun to the Moons' surface.
16140,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the video has no dislikes 🖐🏿
16141,bfThiqDd9FA,What planet are you taking this video from? 😂
16142,bfThiqDd9FA,Монтаж
16143,bfThiqDd9FA,"According to Stormy Daniels, trump's penis has the same shape as that dust cloud... coincidence? I don't think so!"
16144,bfThiqDd9FA,I how love can moon be so cool
16145,bfThiqDd9FA,only in Ohio
16146,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you all love how! How lovely.
16147,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm surprised the moon didn't shift in position after a crash like that.
16148,bfThiqDd9FA,im sure it did move a little bit but buy now it probly moved right back. its so big.
16149,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sustayne I was being facetious
16150,bfThiqDd9FA,A lot of people love how
16151,bfThiqDd9FA,:D :D :D :D
16152,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that my cat 🐈 purrs in my ear and makes me feel unusual.
16153,bfThiqDd9FA,Guy got 5.1 mil are we stupid or is he smart
16154,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the meteor was able to be seen and looks massive. If it was that big the “cloud” would have been much bigger
16155,bfThiqDd9FA,It says it’s supposed to be a rocket
16156,bfThiqDd9FA,Astroids are outside Earth's atmosphere. Meteoroids are inside.
16157,bfThiqDd9FA,Why do so many comments start with I love how
16158,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh moon in day time 👀😯
16159,bfThiqDd9FA,Day and mooooooooon????
16160,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
16161,bfThiqDd9FA,It's on the internet so it has to be true
16162,bfThiqDd9FA,"Your scale is off mate, but nice work"
16163,bfThiqDd9FA,Lemme guess. A site for Resident Brandon’s fangirls?
16164,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cheeseburgers
16165,bfThiqDd9FA,nice edit though
16166,bfThiqDd9FA,How convenient that a camera was there to catch it all so perfectly.
16167,bfThiqDd9FA,Logic.
16168,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s wonderful
16169,bfThiqDd9FA,Face the moon is never that big in the day time
16170,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like Millennium Falcon missed the death star approach
16171,bfThiqDd9FA,Laughing.. kids everywhere will believe this C**p.
16172,bfThiqDd9FA,Very good editing
16173,bfThiqDd9FA,HA!  That's awesome... fun!!
16174,bfThiqDd9FA,I love that the opacity of the mushroom cloud reduces to 0% at about 10fps
16175,bfThiqDd9FA,How can moon crash it's still there
16176,bfThiqDd9FA,"Pov the rocket before it hits the moon:Ok deep breath,before i do this,ALAUH HU BARRRRRR"
16177,bfThiqDd9FA,Montage vidéo
16178,bfThiqDd9FA,Just my dad going to school
16179,bfThiqDd9FA,😂 photoshop vedio big layer how u see that and no one another see mabe nasa sleeping this time 🤣🤣
16180,bfThiqDd9FA,Damnit rick
16181,bfThiqDd9FA,lol he shot a wooden sign and it blew up kinda effects. The space smoke went away way to fast
16182,bfThiqDd9FA,Shopped
16183,bfThiqDd9FA,saitama vs goku
16184,bfThiqDd9FA,This supposed rocket scales out to be over 50 miles long
16185,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they put it on the news and show two different views and showed both sides of the Moon being lit up at the same time
16186,bfThiqDd9FA,"so like you mean a new screw somewhere elce on earth recorded the same event and managed to see how it all looked on the far side?  Wicked.

when they played both at the same time did it look 3d?"
16187,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@sustayne one video shows something coming from the right side and the other video shows som9ething coming from the left side. It's supposedly the same thing so that means both side of the moon is lit up at the same time, but it's not supposed to be that way, its supposed to be dark on one side and lit up on the other"
16188,bfThiqDd9FA,NASA did it
16189,bfThiqDd9FA,I love reading the comments
16190,bfThiqDd9FA,Reasonable explanation: someone was playing bo3 zombies on der eisendrache and accidentally launched the rocket instead of letting it do its test and launched it.
16191,bfThiqDd9FA,They were listening to the Free Bird Guitar Solo while landing (FBGS means there is no slowing down)
16192,bfThiqDd9FA,That must've been one big explosion for the fact that you can see it from that far-
16193,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'm still wondering how a less than 1 mile piece of shoemaker made an earth sized fireball and scar on Jupiter even as it only hit clouds and impacts on earth of that size didn't even do that....

What if it had hit Earth?"
16194,bfThiqDd9FA,Morons
16195,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice effects.
16196,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😅😅😅😅
16197,bfThiqDd9FA,u forgot about nuke in this animation
16198,bfThiqDd9FA,"The dust cloud of the Moon appears to be done in ""time lapse"" as the clouds in the sky travel smoothly. Whoever made this video is an amateur 😂😂"
16199,bfThiqDd9FA,Looked like a mushroom cloud! WTF!
16200,bfThiqDd9FA,So please tell me if the moon is in outer space how can we see this so clear?
16201,bfThiqDd9FA,Nd the moon ain't that big
16202,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing btw
16203,bfThiqDd9FA,Nope.
16204,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how nearly half of these comments start with “I love how.”
16205,bfThiqDd9FA,Not true hahahahahahaha
16206,bfThiqDd9FA,"Science tells us that there would be no explosion at all.  The meteor would have simply penetrated quietly, as we all know the moon is made of cheese!"
16207,bfThiqDd9FA,So....im guessing that was the mission to colonize the moon....oops!
16208,bfThiqDd9FA,That was when Simon forgot to hold hold space to slow down
16209,bfThiqDd9FA,Why everyone starts with I love in these f#@£& comments. Weird F@#£& robots. And this is just vid editing dummies
16210,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is farting😅😂
16211,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahi la Luna se tiro un gran pedo😅
16212,bfThiqDd9FA,More BS..
16213,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16214,bfThiqDd9FA,How cloud expand so much ...good editing
16215,bfThiqDd9FA,Cant even look at the moon at ohio. *sighs*

16222,bfThiqDd9FA,What a fraud!
16223,bfThiqDd9FA,Flouridated
16224,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how ......
16225,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone is saying what they love about this video
16226,bfThiqDd9FA,Bad editor……😅😅😅😅
16227,bfThiqDd9FA,Some are so gullible.
16228,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s no moon….
16229,bfThiqDd9FA,Hilarious! Dust doesn't bloom like that in an airless environment! Yet you alone saw it and filmed it!
16230,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud had to be at the exact perimeter of a round object as if this was a 2d reality. Just so the background of the sky could make the dustcloud stand out
16231,bfThiqDd9FA,Love?
16232,bfThiqDd9FA,"Woahhh,Didn't realize explosion clouds had a lower framerate than the actual video"
16233,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud still float
16234,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cannot disappear in seconds.
16235,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s funny how there’s smoke in space .
16236,bfThiqDd9FA,After Effects!
16237,bfThiqDd9FA,Its ohio view dude stop fricking out
16238,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😅
16239,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice effect & pretty realistic as well!
16240,bfThiqDd9FA,"Realistic in a vaccume? No way Jose. The energy released would've made a bright flash of light. Yet we see only mushroom shaped dust cloud, reacting as if in an atmosphere."
16241,bfThiqDd9FA,@@michealtaylor7745 That's why i say pretty in the sentence my friend.This surely is not the effect that would had something like that i understand that.
16242,bfThiqDd9FA,Blue out the picture window on my neighbers house. No lie.
16243,bfThiqDd9FA,To be the one non complaining brown nose smart ass: Really nicely done and looking cool! Nice work.
16244,bfThiqDd9FA,This is so poorly done
16245,bfThiqDd9FA,ឈប់បោកគេទៀតទៅពូកអាថោកទាប😂🎉
16246,bfThiqDd9FA,"Interesting, you could totally see from the naked eye, the rocket's instant impact, so close to the moon's 10,917 kilometres circumference from 238,900 miles away from Earth. Definitely not Steven Spielberg's work but it's pretty imaginative for the movies though."
16247,bfThiqDd9FA,Well China did test a nuclear missile on the moon this year in 2022
16248,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the I love how trend in the comments just kept going
16249,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud is a mushroom when there is no atmosphere
16250,bfThiqDd9FA,"Weaponized Earth

Do NOT talk to the earth!! Its slave trading with aliens and kidnapping the strong, women and kids to get revenge on people without true reason!

It also paraphrases and bullies the person into depression and desperation for fun and to make the person vulnerable to alien abductions.

The planet earth has now become a biological retard due to space junk and indoctrination. It may even be prematurely retarded as to it becoming a weaponized tool."
16251,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
16252,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon farted
16253,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks smooth nice job
16254,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love all the comments that start with, ""I love"""
16255,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess we should be able to see the space station with the naked eye too or all the rocket that we blast off
16256,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how Chuck Norris plays golf
16257,bfThiqDd9FA,No way…it was only a fart 🤪🐝💨
16258,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how you can see the rocket part
16259,bfThiqDd9FA,"Just the name ""ViralVideoLab""  tells it..  :P"

16261,bfThiqDd9FA,nice try edit
16262,bfThiqDd9FA,Can you see the crash? I don't believe you.
16263,bfThiqDd9FA,"I really wonder why a cloud would form (mushroom) in such a way in a vacuum and low gravity. :) And the speed of the cloud .. i would like to say that it was a nice job, but sorry, too many mistakes."
16264,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the explosion has a mushroom cloud that is only possible on a object with a atmosphere
16265,bfThiqDd9FA,Guess sounds travel faster in zero gravity.
16266,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit!!!
16267,bfThiqDd9FA,"i like the bird song..  (is like a warning.. or alarm call maybe?) 
blackbird??"
16268,bfThiqDd9FA,Ah yes… like a mushroom cloud because the moon has an atmosphere like Earth.
16269,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts with "" i love how "" 🤣"
16270,bfThiqDd9FA,I don’t think rockets doesn’t go that fast because of gravity
16271,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the most...excuse the pun: IMPACTFUL...word in these comments is....

Wait for it....

LOVE!  ❤

LOVE IT, and check it out...!😊"
16272,bfThiqDd9FA,"With such little gravity, the dust cloud would've stayed high for a long time. I really hope nobody actually believes this. Plus...moon is unusually bright during the day, on this day. Uncanny how he just so happened to be taking video at that moment."
16273,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how all these comments cracked me up...😂
16274,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow !!!!! Flakiest video I’ve ever seen. Like when the RoadRunner tricked the coyote over the cliff and alls you see is a puff of smoke when he lands. Very very funny
16275,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket was carrying all the missing Trump ballots.
16276,bfThiqDd9FA,Recontra falso 👎
16277,bfThiqDd9FA,Another illuminati video
16278,bfThiqDd9FA,Horrible
16279,bfThiqDd9FA,Ni el amor que me juró mi ex fue tan falso
16280,bfThiqDd9FA,Too big effect for a rocket part. Retry.
16281,bfThiqDd9FA,This moon is so big or is so close?
16282,bfThiqDd9FA,Can you hear it tho??
16283,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker Will Smiths apology!!!!

16286,bfThiqDd9FA,I love daylight moon
16287,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how he edited the video
16288,bfThiqDd9FA,😅
16289,bfThiqDd9FA,Unrealistic
16290,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it moves the moon to the left on impact and then the moon bounces back into position.
16291,bfThiqDd9FA,Gotta love how in-focus the stock footage dust cloud is at the same (blurry) focal plane of the moon.
16292,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow this is where all the nerds are. I love how all the comments begin with I love how
16293,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
16294,bfThiqDd9FA,hahaha this is funny :D
16295,bfThiqDd9FA,This is 👨‍🚀one small Clip on the Phone ..one giant Leap of editing 👨‍🚀
16296,bfThiqDd9FA,"I was googling ""Moon fart"" and got directed to this video 💩"
16297,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how much everyone seems to love this
16298,bfThiqDd9FA,Imagine the moon is in our atmosphere...and is closer than we are told...and every thing we are told by the media is a lie.
16299,bfThiqDd9FA,"Rest in peace all people who passed away in this tragedy.

⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️"
16300,bfThiqDd9FA,That's ok we will be up there in a few years. We can see if there were any survivors.😲🤕
16301,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there was nothing on the news about this catastrophic event and also I love that it didn't mess up our tides or anything. What a day!
16302,bfThiqDd9FA,合成？
16303,bfThiqDd9FA,feak
16304,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope the people living there were unharmed.

16314,bfThiqDd9FA,The glitchy explosion doesn't help your case.
16315,bfThiqDd9FA,What a joke
16316,bfThiqDd9FA,We can assume the person faking this video doesn’t understand physics.
16317,bfThiqDd9FA,You need to learn about FPS before using after effects.
16318,bfThiqDd9FA,People are getting dumber  all the time ...GOD help us all to survive the abject stupidity   that is infecting the Human race 🙏
16319,bfThiqDd9FA,Nasa there funny
16320,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow amazing thing to witness
16321,bfThiqDd9FA,Big shite moon.
16322,bfThiqDd9FA,"Can you imagine the size of the actual object hitting the moon for us to be able to see it  like that with naked eye? 
And also... What happened to the crater now? Why can't we see a new crater on the moon?"
16323,bfThiqDd9FA,cause the crater is rigjt on the edge. our angle is wrong tp see it good.
16324,bfThiqDd9FA,I Love that photoshop....its not betterthan mine.😄
16325,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the ""rocket part"" is about 50 km long so that we can see it clearly from earth"
16326,bfThiqDd9FA,Only in ohio☠
16327,bfThiqDd9FA,This tells me they're building underground bases on the moon as we've always thought
16328,bfThiqDd9FA,None of the commenters are taking into account the physics associated with a flat earth moon.
16329,bfThiqDd9FA,"Han Solo is coming our of Warp speed to take Princess Leah home to Alderaan but The death star blew it up. And now Vader is gonna blow up our moon.
This could get messy!!😁"
16330,bfThiqDd9FA,Debris could not be thrown out that fast from an impact
16331,bfThiqDd9FA,says you.

16333,bfThiqDd9FA,Falso
16334,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool edit!

16336,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
16337,bfThiqDd9FA,Down in Ohio
16338,bfThiqDd9FA,"RIP, The moon farted at the speed of light, now it's gonna become a trend between the Astro TikTok and when the sun do this they'll say it's china's artificial sun"

16340,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how you guys are all saying ""I love how."""
16341,bfThiqDd9FA,Didn't knew a part of a rocket can cause explosion equal to 4000 Megaton TNT.
16342,bfThiqDd9FA,This is visible because the universe is only 500 miles long.
16343,bfThiqDd9FA,"For something like this to happen it would have to be an object at least several miles wide, it would have to hit the Moon at a perfect angle like in the video and the material from the collision would rise up much slower and it would look very different."
16344,bfThiqDd9FA,bro wtf is day and there is the moon wtffffff
16345,bfThiqDd9FA,IT IS A GOOD GRAPHICS.   IT IS DISSELECTED BUDDY....BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
16346,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow we were so lucky the moon saved us from an extinction level collision event with that asteriod.
How come no one else saw the asteroid coming towards us, and the velocity of the asteroid, must have been a significant fraction of light speed."
16347,bfThiqDd9FA,😅🤣😂😆😅😂🤣😂🤣😂
16348,bfThiqDd9FA,Some fool just fired a nuke at the Moon. That's not a regular strike like a meteor which has a different ejecta pattern.
16349,bfThiqDd9FA,At least you tried to make it realistic

16355,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how some people are so gullible, that they believe everything they given without questioning."
16356,bfThiqDd9FA,What just hit to the moon
16357,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, the moon is so close it's in the Earth's atmosphere, huh? Forget the fire trail it's not leaving as it blazes along at what must be tens of thousands of MPH/KPH (too tired to do the math). That's a minor thing. If the moon and earth were orbiting each other that closely, tidal forces would tear both of them apart. Nicely rendered, though."
16358,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing how small and near the moon appears. Amazing that you had camera on the ‘event’ at the right moment. “Amazing.”
16359,bfThiqDd9FA,How can the moon appear small & near? Nearer & bigger maybe.
16360,bfThiqDd9FA,@@michealtaylor7745         Looks near due to impact material dispersal rate - hence smaller moon as well.
16361,bfThiqDd9FA,Did you love that though?
16362,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tardymo  Yeah.  Creative hoofrah keeps the world wide.
16363,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how somebody was videoing the moon that particular second…
16364,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there is no flash and there is no visible heating

16366,bfThiqDd9FA,😀😃😆😅🤣

16378,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like how the moon's atmosphere causes the cloud to form a mushroom just like on earth...
(The moon has no atmosphere.)"
16379,bfThiqDd9FA,i THOUGHT the moon was hollow so if something hit it we would have heard a ring....right?
16380,bfThiqDd9FA,"Your clearly dumb. First off, no the moon is not hollow, second, sound cannot travel through space so we would not hear it and it’s way too far away anyway."
16381,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hehe, yeah, you don't get a mushroom cloud on the moon where there is no atmosphere. :P"
16382,bfThiqDd9FA,That's how moon fart
16383,bfThiqDd9FA,A Lotta love here! 😄
16384,bfThiqDd9FA,Great timing that rock was bigger than the dinosaur killer how long ago was that cause we should be getting the best meteor shower in history.
16385,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how there was no sound.
16386,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the British government has sent the first load of illegal immigrants to the moon to colonise and take over there also.
16387,bfThiqDd9FA,This so stupid 😂
16388,bfThiqDd9FA,Such bogus bullshit 😢
16389,bfThiqDd9FA,Parece falso porque el humo se ve a baja velocidad y con menos fotogramas que el resto del video

16406,bfThiqDd9FA,Stupid shit!
16407,bfThiqDd9FA,Yea that dust went up way to fast.....slow it down about 1000x and it will look more realistic
16408,bfThiqDd9FA,Even worse -- you do not get a mushroom cloud if there is no atmosphere. :P
16409,bfThiqDd9FA,This n**ga about to crash into earth
16410,bfThiqDd9FA,Kkk ridículo
16411,bfThiqDd9FA,Falso

16414,bfThiqDd9FA,Video falso
16415,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how no one else knew about this event and this guy knew exactly when and where to record but the media did not even know about this? Hmm
16416,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all how does the moon show up on the day and second of all how does the astroid doesn't reach the speed of light anyone with me ?
16417,bfThiqDd9FA,"Have you seriously never seen the moon during the day? It obviously couldn't be a full moon, but you can often see the moon during the day."
16418,bfThiqDd9FA,Anything that size traveling that fast would of shattered the moon
16419,bfThiqDd9FA,Love the way he captured Saitama on camera

16434,bfThiqDd9FA,Why tf are they bombing it?
16435,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the sound traveled through the vacuum of space almost immediately
16436,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait, you could *hear* it? I couldn't on my laptop. Time isn't even a factor-- sound can't propagate *at all* through the near vacuum of space."
16437,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@richardmoore6137 yeah, the dummy left the sound in"
16438,bfThiqDd9FA,"sound is movement, literally everything moves, therefore sounds travels through space, albeit slowly, however this proves how little you know about physics"
16439,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno Sound needs a medium-- molecules to vibrate and pass along that movement. The only place in space where this is possible is in dust clouds, where there are enough particles per cubic meter to transfer that sound. But even there, the soundwaves are too low for human ears to hear. So the sound in this video would be impossible. What were you saying about physics, Mr. Pedantic?"
16440,bfThiqDd9FA,Or you know. The fact that it traveled at all.
16441,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno lmao. ""therefore"". ""albeit"". Really trying hard while you're wrong."
16442,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dallassegno sound is an energy not a movement 💀
16443,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@scythalyst533 don't agree with the guy, but those two terms are kind of the same thing, atleast in this context"
16444,bfThiqDd9FA,Ben is in love everyone 💕 ❤ congratulations Ben 👏 for coming out
16445,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah that settles it, this comment section is full of bots."
16446,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@scythalyst533 It is both being that energy is an oscillating wave.   In the case of sound that energy wave is mechanical or caused by matter passing through matter.  Therefore it can't be energy if it is not also ""moving""."
16447,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno No, Sound is a mechanical wave.  A mechanical wave is oscillating molecules (matter) moving through matter.  Sound can only move through a vacuum in the form of radio waves, which are electromagnetic waves, that can then be transferred into mechanical waves once they pass through matter.  So, it is not sound moving through space, it is light that is then transferred into sound.  Basically, the opposite of Sonar, using sound to see."
16448,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dallassegno there's nothing in the void of space to carry the sound. Sound needs something to vibrate like air.
16449,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno You apparently don’t know how physics works. Sound is a mechanical wave/energy, thus requiring a medium to travel or transfer energy. Sound cannot travel through space because it is a vacuum, which means there are no particles of matter in contact to transfer mechanical energy waves like sound."
16450,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dallassegno sound is molecules vibrating dinglenuts… if there is no fluid such as air or water there is so sound…ask any physicist or astrophysicist. There is NO sound in the static vacuum of space.
16451,bfThiqDd9FA,Sound can't travel through a vacuum!  That's why I can't hear the phone ring when my wife is vacuuming the carpet! (joke borrowed from my brother)!🤣
16452,bfThiqDd9FA,I hear nothing but birds chirping
16453,bfThiqDd9FA,I listened to this at max volume with noise canceling headphones. There is no sound
16454,bfThiqDd9FA,@@D3THL0CKE the coward probably removed the sound after reading this then
16455,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno if sound was able to move through space, we would probably be hearing the sun roaring like a chainsaw right by your eardrums"
16456,bfThiqDd9FA,I heard it in stereo.
16457,bfThiqDd9FA,@@matimus100 What is it with you and suggesting everyone in is love. Weird.
16458,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno So, you showed how little you know about physics while trying to show how someone else doesn't know about physics... must be hard being this dumb"
16459,bfThiqDd9FA,I can hear the wind whistling eagerly at the particular moment
16460,bfThiqDd9FA,There's sound? Ouch
16461,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno I think it’s you who doesn’t understand how physics work. Space is literally defined by a lack of “stuff”, if you will. And let’s say sound could travel through space, it would need to travel 238,000 miles, and it would have dissipated a long time before it reaches earth. And let’s say through all of that, if we could hear the sound of impact, it would take approximately 14 days for the sound to reach earth."
16462,bfThiqDd9FA,Space is not a vacuum

16465,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ngl, I raised the volume right before impact"
16466,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@dallassegno How can sound travel through a lack of material? Sound reverberates through air, bounces off objects, as it bounces its waves lengthen out until the point of dissipation. There's absolutely no way anyone would audibly hear the impact."
16467,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how silly humans could be
16468,bfThiqDd9FA,Kinda cool how the cloud formed a heart like it was meant to fall in love with the moon
16469,bfThiqDd9FA,How the hell is there a moon during sun light??
16470,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that real.
16471,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats 1 day after my birthday..
16472,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just farted !
16473,bfThiqDd9FA,How is no one talking about how the moon is even photoshopped in…  like they couldn’t just wait until it was showing and then photoshop in the “explosion”
16474,bfThiqDd9FA,"Crazy, I swear I’ve seen stock footage of that exact explosion but with no background!"
16475,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone didn't notice that except him

16477,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my butt's been wiped!
16478,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket disappears behind the very thin layer of cloud.
16479,bfThiqDd9FA,Pennsylvania north america heard it late evening only in one of its stage cycles november 2022 mid month end week 2nd of Nov. 2022 sounded like something exlpoded on our world and blacked it out with oil
16480,bfThiqDd9FA,Not sure what stage cycle moon phase it was calendars dont show it anymore around here
16481,bfThiqDd9FA,So sad and demolishing for such a young world those things could ruins us if that was purposing seemed abit largely menacing whatever crashed your way in march and we only heard it mid november 2022
16482,bfThiqDd9FA,Whatever it was a satellite or something could be giving us a major incline of global warming knowing the moon keeps us cool and we dont want much volcanic erupts or inserts for how great a world it was...
16483,bfThiqDd9FA,Does anyone know which moon it was looks like jupitor or pluto
16484,bfThiqDd9FA,Might be neptune or mars though i cant tell by the face or 'surface imprints'

16491,bfThiqDd9FA,"also one more thing; if the dot hitting the moon is an object visible at this distance, it is rather big. a few times the mount Everest at such velocity, the effect would be quite different. 
physics in space is a bit my field. Yes the gravity of the moon would bring dust back down but more like a bubble of dust, and one that is just fading very, very slowly."
16492,bfThiqDd9FA,fabricated and homosexual
16493,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow the live action WALL-E movie seems to be going well
16494,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, the dust comes up from hundreds of miles apart from the impact ?"

16497,bfThiqDd9FA,"Cool animation, nice job!"
16498,bfThiqDd9FA,"Before. 14 thousand centuries ago. This event was mentioned in the Holy Qur’an in Surat Al-Qamar: I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan, in the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. {The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split asunder [1], and if they see a sign, they turn away and say continuous magic} This is only one of several signs that God exists and that the Day of Resurrection has come very close and it is at the gates... As for this, it is not true because it really happened several centuries ago.. . and people stay not believe ."
16499,bfThiqDd9FA,Bruh why the fuck is this moon so damn big
16500,bfThiqDd9FA,"Apparent speed of the impactor: 3500 km/5sec = 42.000 km/h
Apparent diameter of the impactor: 250 km

Estimated energy of the impact based on speed and size: 1.8 * 10^28 joules or about 4 * 10 ^15 tonnes of TNT or about 70 million czar bombas
Estimated height of the ejecta: 1200 km
Somehow the impact seems to have caused an immediate 1200 km atmosphere forming a mushroom cloud

strange event.... !"
16501,bfThiqDd9FA,First of all the moon is not that close to the earth and second. This dust cloud would not have been visible as the atmosphere would have just spread the dust all over the surface of the moon
16502,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people like start their comment with I love how…
16503,bfThiqDd9FA,Learn about physics again dude
16504,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of shit.
16505,bfThiqDd9FA,I love it when the moon starts farting

16507,bfThiqDd9FA,wow the dust cloud goes at 5 frames per second wow
16508,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how there is almost a full moon in broad daylight
16509,bfThiqDd9FA,thankfully it dint happen after sunset cause we would never seen it.  or if it was cloudy on the moon.

16511,bfThiqDd9FA,BS 😂
16512,bfThiqDd9FA,how would you see the moon  so clearliy at day time?
16513,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocker that actually hit the moon on this date was traveling at 5800 mph. The moon's diameter is 2159 miles. Figure it out. If you can.
16514,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud mushrooms like it's being pulled downwards by hot air
16515,bfThiqDd9FA,I love turtles.
16516,bfThiqDd9FA,Crap
16517,bfThiqDd9FA,The Eiffel Tower looks smaller than that from 3 miles away.  The moon is approximately  240k miles.  The rocket would have had to been about 15 miles tall.  Over twice as high as the typical commercial plane flies.  Why is everyone talking about the dust?  haha
16518,bfThiqDd9FA,HAHAHAHA !!!!!

16528,bfThiqDd9FA,"That is hilarious that people think you'd see the aircraft from that far away. 
You would not be able to see any space shuttle we own from the earth if it was close enough to the moon to crash into it  Nice try though!"
16529,bfThiqDd9FA,Did You get fired from DreamWorks productions?

The moon has always been Earth's protective shield. 
In ancient times, shortly before the birth of Rome, a legend speaks of the birth of Venus, apparently following a celestial collision between Jupiter and an unknown star. 
There was then a great game of billiards between the planets before they stabilized at their current locations. 
The ancients speak of a titanic battle between Venus and Mars which came dangerously close in its new elliptical course to such an extent that the mood of the populations at each approach of the star was modified at its approach to such an extent that the woman was fighting against her husband, brother against brother, Nations against others.. 
Then one day, when Mars was getting dangerously close to the Earth, Athena or Venus (?), used the Moon as a Shield . The shock was terrible, and Mars was sent to its current trajectory. 
It would seem, still according to the ancients, that gigantic lightning struck the Earth in such a way that the places where they raged literally melted and that a city entire state was totally vitrified in an instant. (Legend of the destruction of Sodom? ) 
Anyway, since then Mars has become the planet of War and Venus that of love. 
This is what I have been able to find from my research in ancient writings .. .

La lune a toujours été le bouclier de protection de la Terre. 
Dans les temps anciens, un peu avant la naissance de Rome, une légende parle de la naissance de Vénus, suite semble-t-il d'une collision céleste entre  Jupiter et un astre inconnu. 
Se trama alors une grande partie de billard entre les planètes avant qu'elles ne se stabilisent à leurs emplacements actuels. 
Les anciens parlent d'un combat titanesque entre Venus et Mars qui se rapprocha dangereusement dans son nouveau parcours elliptique à tel point que l'humeur des populations à chaque approche de l'astre en fût modifié à son approche à tel point que la femme se battait contre son époux, le frère contre le frère, les Nations contre les autres.. 
Puis un jour, alors que Mars se rapprochait dangereusement de la Terre, Athéna ou Venus (?), se servi de la Lune comme Bouclier. Le choc fût terrible, et Mars fût envoyée à sa trajectoire actuelle.. 
Il semblerait, toujours d'après les anciens que des éclairs gigantesques frappaient la Terre de telles sorte que les lieux où ces derniers sévissaient fondaient littéralement et qu'une ville état entière fût totalement vitrifié en un instant. (Légende de la destruction de Sodome ? ) 
Quoiqu'il en soit, depuis lors Mars devint la planète de la Guerre et Venus celle de l'amour. 
Voilà ce que j'ai pu relevé de mes recherches dans les écrits anciens.. ."

16704,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool video what editor did you use to make it
16705,bfThiqDd9FA,The mysterious object must have been really huge because you can see the dust
16706,bfThiqDd9FA,"We hope the cameraman survives, oh wait… he always survives 😂"
16707,bfThiqDd9FA,maybe we should record him crashing into the moon then talk about his dustcloud
16708,bfThiqDd9FA,Tbh I’d steal a chick to keep as my own
16709,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the body crashing into the moon is so large you can see it with the naked eye.
16710,bfThiqDd9FA,I love watching this shit while waiting for my pizza to show up.
16711,bfThiqDd9FA,Edit
16712,bfThiqDd9FA,Transformers.
16713,bfThiqDd9FA,the explosion's framerate is like twice as little :/
16714,bfThiqDd9FA,This is really how Space 1999 got started.
16715,bfThiqDd9FA,And how can the moon move that fast in the morning?!
16716,bfThiqDd9FA,That was the clouds moving idiot. Also what difference does the time make?
16717,bfThiqDd9FA,Cause it looks like your so close to the moon
16718,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edition
16719,bfThiqDd9FA,I heard the explosion on 4th of march 2022 and saw it through my window
16720,bfThiqDd9FA,DEEPFAKE
16721,bfThiqDd9FA,ahh yes the normal frame drops of reality
16722,bfThiqDd9FA,I love  those BIRDIE WARNING CHIRPS.
16723,bfThiqDd9FA,Хороший монтаж 👍
16724,bfThiqDd9FA,cpuld not have said it better.  or worse.
16725,bfThiqDd9FA,"it looks like they are fighting , it's like goku"
16726,bfThiqDd9FA,"When you render the video, make sure you render it at the fps of the lowest thing in it so it’ll look less noticeable"
16727,bfThiqDd9FA,What state are you in that you filmed this ?
16728,bfThiqDd9FA,an altered state
16729,bfThiqDd9FA,Quite interesting
16730,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the rocket some how made a mushroom cloud and had a big enough impact to be seen from the earth
16731,bfThiqDd9FA,Sizin bütün videolarınız belədir 😂😂😂
16732,bfThiqDd9FA,Joli montage.
16733,bfThiqDd9FA,Mdrrrr
16734,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah, yes, the old hypersonic dust cloud behaving like a heated updraft in an atmosphere. Love it when I see those on romantic walks at night with bae.
Might want to check out the video from the DART mission and reanimate this."
16735,bfThiqDd9FA,you should make the explotion clip little blurry
16736,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice graphic,, PS5"
16737,bfThiqDd9FA,4.4 miĺlion views they got what they were after just click bait.
16738,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust from explosive fps is way lower :D
16739,bfThiqDd9FA,😂people will fall for anything 🤣 🙄🤷🏻
16740,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon is a filter to hide Aliens bodies on earth. If thé Moon was not there the aliens who live on earth with human bodies would be Seen in true alien form.
16741,bfThiqDd9FA,How did you saw the moon the this broad daylight? 🤔🤫
16742,bfThiqDd9FA,Have you never been outside before?
16743,bfThiqDd9FA,@@JohnHazenhousen  Yes I have but it's very hard to see moon in the daytime from where I am due to the heavy pollution. I'm not saying it's impossible it was just a random question. Duh!
16744,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice editing 🙄, which program has made this ?"
16745,bfThiqDd9FA,if it were to really happen it would be trouble. Fortunately it is only a PC processing ..😅
16746,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how it mushrooms even in space lol
16747,bfThiqDd9FA,Cute kittens exploding videos...
16748,bfThiqDd9FA,You forgot when things go bang on the moon the debris goes straight up not like a bomb exploding in a atmosphere
16749,bfThiqDd9FA,Hoax 😎
16750,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh, bosh. Try harder."
16751,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see the dust cloud before the rocket may impact
16752,bfThiqDd9FA,The significance of this event is astounding!
16753,bfThiqDd9FA,"People up here giving all these facts about the moon like they been there to see the surface for themselves, measure distance for themselves or know the atmosphere for themselves and etc....
We only know what we've been taught. Period. Can't say everything with certainty!"
16754,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦‍♂️
16755,bfThiqDd9FA,"You only one who seen this 
Millions on people miss this I be damned"
16756,bfThiqDd9FA,👎👎
16757,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the Moon farts 💨
16758,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how every comment starts wi4h ""I love how """
16759,bfThiqDd9FA,"Could be a multimedia project for like highschool or college, but instead its spam/misleading content."
16760,bfThiqDd9FA,In order to see that from that far away that explosion has to be insanely huge 😅
16761,bfThiqDd9FA,Well it was. How else would you be able to hear the sound of it within seconds. It was enormous. I'm sad I missed this once in a lifetime sight in person. I'll never forgive myself.
16762,bfThiqDd9FA,"They should have had the little Martian from WB with a sign that said, ""This means war"""
16763,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh wow a moon at the morning no wonder why it’s so close
16764,bfThiqDd9FA,You realise you can see the moon during the day right?
16765,bfThiqDd9FA,Its not even night😂
16766,bfThiqDd9FA,Have you never been outside before?
16767,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is a shake in the footage but the ""object"" doesn't follow that. It's faked."
16768,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s cool
16769,bfThiqDd9FA,What a crock. Moon is 2D. Crash not possible
16770,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does this video exist?
16771,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow the speed of light sure is slow
16772,bfThiqDd9FA,"Funny little video, other have already pointed out the many MANY flaws in this so I'm just gonna get a laugh at it."
16773,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂
16774,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can hear the collision and the fact that you hear it 10 seconds later
16775,bfThiqDd9FA,I love these comments
16776,bfThiqDd9FA,moon's fart.
16777,bfThiqDd9FA,A moment of silence for all the moonmen who parished in this tragedy.
16778,bfThiqDd9FA,Remember when we came here on the lunar space ark and were sworn not to tell the plebs? Oh damn...
16779,bfThiqDd9FA,Another MapQuest user bites the dust.
16780,bfThiqDd9FA,"In fact, the moon farted😁👍👍👍"
16781,bfThiqDd9FA,"Interesting how an impact didn't make light.

Where is the plasma resulting of such a massive object impacting at that speed?

It would be nice to calculate the size, the speed, inclination and mass of the object.

Moon Radius: 1700km
Covers half of the moon in 1 second
Speed: 800km/s = 0.3% velocidad de la luz

Just for you to know there was such an event long time ago and was recorded by people of the era, they described it as a big flash of light not a smokey thingy."
16782,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice Edit
16783,bfThiqDd9FA,You are a total and complete dumb fuck for putting shit out like this there are some stupid people in this world
16784,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is in our atmosphere.
16785,bfThiqDd9FA,That's look 🧢
16786,bfThiqDd9FA,Did the moon fart?
16787,bfThiqDd9FA,I need telescopic eyes!

16790,bfThiqDd9FA,When did this happen? 🧐 🤔
16791,bfThiqDd9FA,This is total cap
16792,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah that was just fart
16793,bfThiqDd9FA,Did the moon just fart
16794,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of crap
16795,bfThiqDd9FA,"How did the moon appear to earth during day time 🤔
and how the hell did ur cam caught this ?
we can see by telescope only 
dose ur phone have any new technology?"
16796,bfThiqDd9FA,"while you are all criticizing the many technical (valid) flaws of the video, he got over 4M views, which was the only point of all this 😊 💥"
16797,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon massive
16798,bfThiqDd9FA,What's is that is like a meteor?
16799,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn it ET did it again!
16800,bfThiqDd9FA,That was saitama.
16801,bfThiqDd9FA,Why was this not on the news 🌚😳
16802,bfThiqDd9FA,the lighting for the smoke should not match our atmospheric light
16803,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
16804,bfThiqDd9FA,No idea this existed..
16805,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bottom line is Why are they waging war against the Heavens , if they read Bible they'd know God wins am I rite I say."
16806,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon looks so big during the midst of the day. So close you could almost touch it.
16807,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ik it's editing, but so cool."
16808,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket must have been big as the size of Florida
16809,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how clearly we can see this object impact the moon from his smart phone
16810,bfThiqDd9FA,hrub bruh
16811,bfThiqDd9FA,Haha well done ✌️😅
16812,bfThiqDd9FA,Well the next crash is certainly going to be at my house 😜
16813,bfThiqDd9FA,This show how they are trying to destroy Earth
16814,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can hear the sound of the impact in seconds.
16815,bfThiqDd9FA,Just the fact you can hear it
16816,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ctforants6246 Exactly. 😆
16817,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you can see the rocket itself.

16825,bfThiqDd9FA,what....... 😯
16826,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud was able to expand at about 9% the speed of light.
16827,bfThiqDd9FA,G 😆
16828,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
16829,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16830,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you calculated 🤤
16831,bfThiqDd9FA,I agree how a dust can expand at that much speed in space
16832,bfThiqDd9FA,0.9% speed of light
16833,bfThiqDd9FA,Ha ha ha ha I now have coffee all over my truck
16834,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
16835,bfThiqDd9FA,@@DemandAlphabetBeBrokenUp did you get it cleaned up?
16836,bfThiqDd9FA,@@smartfck4 wrong
16837,bfThiqDd9FA,"We are testing photoids, weapons that can destroy stars with a single shot. This was proof of concept."
16838,bfThiqDd9FA,That's the first thing I thought. But would it be possible with the differences in the atmosphere and gravity. I'm goin to ask my genius astronomy professor tomorrow.
16839,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahhh yea bro wtf ae like the size of half the moon in seconds
16840,bfThiqDd9FA,"You are seriously misjudging just how fast light travels.  Light travels at 299,792 km/s. The moon is 3470  km in diameter.  That means light could travel the length of 86 moons in one second. So. dust travelling 9% the speed of light would take 1 second to be the distance of 7.74 moons. Clearly that is not the case. By my guess by eyeballing this footage in 1 secondsthat gets about 1/20th the diameter of the moon, or 174 km/s ROUGHLY.  Or 0.057% the speed of light. Which is still hecka fast, but not relativistic 9% of the speed of light fast."
16841,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shayneoneill1506 bro your too serious,what is with you people these days, it's called a figure of speech you know....""the fish was this big"""
16842,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shayneoneill1506 you seriously misjudged how serious my comment was. You should try having some fun in life. Read some of the other comments on what everyone loves about this video for context.   Also, I love how much of your time I wasted with a simple joke."
16843,bfThiqDd9FA,You beat me to it. LMAO
16844,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shayneoneill1506 Of course, you calculated completely correctly and kudos to you for not accepting any information easily,, but there is one more simple one: if we compare the speed of approaching the object to the surface of the moon with the speed of rising ash, then we will realize that the speed  The ash is less than the speed of that object and the speed of that object is finally 300 km/s"
16845,bfThiqDd9FA,Someone got creative in a studio
16846,bfThiqDd9FA,@@farhadkohkan711 wrong.
16847,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO! I almost spit coffee out across the room.
16848,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂
16849,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not only is the video clearly presented as edited, but your math is WAYYY off. It took about 4 seconds for the dust to expand a quarter of the moons diameter, or about 600 miles. 600 miles in 4 seconds is 540,000 mph. The speed of light is 671,000,000 mph, and 9% of that is 60.39 million."
16850,bfThiqDd9FA,@@smartfck4 closer to 0.08% actually. I did the math unlike this guy
16851,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@12lbbluefish3 not only was what I said clearly a joke, but you are waaaaayyyyy in deperate need of a sence of humor."
16852,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think it’s possible, but the moon should be break into pieces"
16853,bfThiqDd9FA,No atmosphere and no gravity on the moon. For every action in space there is reaction in space without earth's usual variables.
16854,bfThiqDd9FA,or how the *spacecraft* is going 10000km/s or mach 300
16855,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jaybee7075 last I checked the commenter said "" at about 9%"" which would qualify this statement as an estimation. An estimation that is likely wrong Mr. Big Brain."
16856,bfThiqDd9FA,@@SHREDTILLDEAD what the hell does that have anything to do with what I said Mr big brain
16857,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂
16858,bfThiqDd9FA,"9% the speed of light is about 16,765 miles per second.
The diameter of earth is about 7958 miles.
The moon is significantly smaller than the earth, 2,159 miles.
If he cloud was expanding at .09c it would expand over 7 times the diameter of the moon in one second."
16859,bfThiqDd9FA,@@jackpresnull3818 none of you are factoring in that my 9% the speed of light claim is based on the frame rate of the dust cloud. My math is dead on. You guys just too busy basing your math on the frame rate of the rest of the video.

16861,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@derpskipfukington6578 I don't need to worry about frame rate if video playing at normal speed,  I only worry about time"

16864,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jackpresnull3818 as in look deeper, I meant check how everyone's comments are jokes. Including mine. As I said previously. Maybe you're too deep. Because this all went right over your head."

16870,bfThiqDd9FA,@@derpskipfukington6578 its pretty funny the analysis offended you. But what does that mean?

16951,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahaha
16952,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you imagined to fool around.
16953,bfThiqDd9FA,that's why it's at 9 fps bruh... Basic physics
16954,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao
16955,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16956,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂
16957,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😅
16958,bfThiqDd9FA,90%
16959,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@12lbbluefish3 I actually ran a quick n dirty and figured it went about 1/4 the diameter of the moon in 9 seconds which is about 60 miles per second or around 0.03% of the speed of light.  Thats still pretty fast for dust...but thiz guy did his homework before he made this thing.
16960,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@jackpresnull3818 i calculated 0.03c or 60 miles per second which is basically what was shown as the initial velocity.  The cloud went about 540 miles in 9 seconds.  Now the question is, would it just fall right back down at that point??? And how fast would it fall right back down."
16961,bfThiqDd9FA,"The issue is more in this shape . It looks like an atmosphere like explosion.(convection shape) however there is no atmosphere on the moon . It should be more like a v cone shape if you want, plus there is no reason of the cloud to disappear. It should coming down or be expelled out in space drifting away from the moon."
16962,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people still believe moon to be a solid object 😅
16963,bfThiqDd9FA,"Also how the same impact is not only filmed from different locations, but also with different moonphases"
16964,bfThiqDd9FA,"@S once you play the dust cloud at the same frame rate as the rest of the video, it becomes 9%."
16965,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16966,bfThiqDd9FA,"i like how the cloud interacts with moon's atmosphere. awesome !! i always knew, there must be life."
16967,bfThiqDd9FA,And not only this... The mushroom effect like there is air
16968,bfThiqDd9FA,When Wile E. Coyote crashes into the moon while strapped to his ACME rocket:
16969,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@Derpskip Fukington  I happened to love your comment and simultaneously loved how it was mathematically exaggerated. I do want to push back on the ""having some fun in life"" reply you made though. For us whirly bird nerds measuring reality and building possibilities theoretically with mental models and computations... that is our fun with life. We are immersed in our joys too, they are just cerebral. I think he was just sharing his own life fun with mathematical justifications for what his mind saw as your comment.

16972,bfThiqDd9FA,@@brianpoulsen7373 see my frame rate comment.
16973,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16974,bfThiqDd9FA,My God reading this thread had me rolling!! It's from viral video labs.... lmao!!!!
16975,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jaybee7075 It didn't sound like hyperbole, it sounded pedantically pretentious."
16976,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
16977,bfThiqDd9FA,But still less than 30 frames per second 😞
16978,bfThiqDd9FA,The scale was sooo off & yeah it suddenly became slow motion. hahaha The old video with the fighter jets escorting a flying saucer was more convincing. hehe
16979,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's actually more like 50km/second, still far faster than a 'normal' mushroom cloud; at the proposed 9% of lightspeed, ie 30,000km/second, the cloud would literally disappear in the blink of an eye; it'd be out of frame in under a frame."
16980,bfThiqDd9FA,"...and the Moon, with no atmosphere, welcomed the quick return of all the parent particles."
16981,bfThiqDd9FA,Npc
16982,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@smartfck4He said 9%.. is this to be more accurate by saying it was slower, or is it a confusion with how percentages are written?"
16983,bfThiqDd9FA,@@govind315Ayoo
16984,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@shayneoneill1506still the rocket went with about 1% the speed of light, which is wayyyy to fast."
16985,bfThiqDd9FA,That wouldn't even be close to 9% lightspeed.
16986,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ominous-omnipresent-they recheck your math. Apply the differences in framerates. Once you account for that you get 8.627483658359572LGBTQ586932 percent the speed of light.
16987,bfThiqDd9FA,"Also, there seems to be an atmosphere 😂"
16988,bfThiqDd9FA,It is not impossible for a dust cloud to expand at any speed slower than c in principle.
16989,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
16990,bfThiqDd9FA,I also quite like how it took about 5 seconds to disperse when there's no atmosphere and therefore no wind.
16991,bfThiqDd9FA,It expands or rises that fast because of the anti gravitational directiods ejected during donald trumps last attempt at making sense.
16992,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the cloud just vanished without a atmosphere
16993,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people can do such complicated calculations with just their eyes. Maybe you should replace some of the high-tech optics NASA is paying so much money for??
16994,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@smartfck40.0009% I am a YouTube scientist. Ask anyone. 😂😂😂
16995,bfThiqDd9FA,And billow into a mushroom in the lunar atmosphere….oh wait. 😂
16996,bfThiqDd9FA,it also expended as if the Moon had atmosphere
16997,bfThiqDd9FA,people do not understand how far away the Moon is and how ridiculous this looks lmao
16998,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@scmcgevery single one of you nerds who has come in to be like well actually has come up with a different  answer lmaooo

17004,bfThiqDd9FA,Same bro
17005,bfThiqDd9FA,Looked like to me. The Moon was spinning? Dragging dust cloud like a tail? Right after it disappeared.. towards end?
17006,bfThiqDd9FA,impossible !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
17007,bfThiqDd9FA,"And it behaved like ejecta traveling through an atmosphere rather than through space, staying in a confined area and forming a ball shape, as if following the heat column of a nuclear detonation."
17008,bfThiqDd9FA,And how the moon was way bigger scale..
17009,bfThiqDd9FA,Your probably a dumb ass believer 🤤🤤🤤🤤​@@govind315
17010,bfThiqDd9FA,Indeed shadows can move faster than light.
17011,bfThiqDd9FA,At the speed of light 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮BLOODBATH!
17012,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not even to mention the ""out of control rocket"""
17013,bfThiqDd9FA,Also I like how it made a mushroom cloud shape like it would in Earth's atmosphere. 😂 Ohhh kids.
17014,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon dust don't fuck around
17015,bfThiqDd9FA,But only if the moon is as far away as they want you to think it is...
17016,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nowhere near 9%, but yes still too fast for what we’re seeing"
17017,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the framerate on the explosion differs from the rest of the video
17018,bfThiqDd9FA,And almost became the size the moon should actually be 😆
17019,bfThiqDd9FA,@@DemandAlphabetBeBrokenUp I got truck all over my coffee 😪
17020,bfThiqDd9FA,What I thought
17021,bfThiqDd9FA,And also how the dust cloud has air resistance... in space 🤣
17022,bfThiqDd9FA,Have you not seen the Beirut blast
17023,bfThiqDd9FA,@@richardturner9755 that blast was freaking slow in comparison to light speed. Light travels around the earth nearly 8 times in just one second.
17024,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wouldn’t that be 16,740 miles per second?  🧐"
17025,bfThiqDd9FA,and I am just curious why the sound took so long to reach that it never reached Earth.
17026,bfThiqDd9FA,@@crewrangergaming9582 There is no sound in a vacuum
17027,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@jaybee7075that's not what a figure of speech is.
17028,bfThiqDd9FA,@@isaiahayers1550 so what is it then?
17029,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jaybee7075  things like metaphors, hyperbole and exaggeration. ""I've seen it a million times"" is a figure of speech. ""It's raining cats and dogs"" is another. ""About 9% the speed of light"" is not a figure of speech. It's a miscalculation."
17030,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@isaiahayers1550 oh, did not look at it that way ,well well well than it was a mere huge miscalculation"
17031,bfThiqDd9FA,This also happens when I fart. Ever seen half a continent smoked like that?
17032,bfThiqDd9FA,Sun is out
17033,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust goes so fast up from the moon because gravity is way lower than on earth.
17034,bfThiqDd9FA,At 10 fps!
17035,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I'm autistic of course I fact check every joke""  wow way to many of you. I'm lucky I'm not that level of autistic   azzbrgrz ftw"
17036,bfThiqDd9FA,"the speed is not exact, but that's not important, the rest looks very well made, since the moon has no atmosphere, don't know if you knew that, the expansion happens much faster as on earth and the altitude was even more impressive as your ""9% speed o. light"""
17037,bfThiqDd9FA,or how the video is in 30fps and the cloud expands in what feels like 10frames per second 😂
17038,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@derpskipfukington6578  some people take things very literally, especially when it comes to information that they have knowledge in. This person didn't mean anything rude. They were merely educating us. I appreciate this. I also appreciate a good joke, like yours. Peace and love, folks."
17039,bfThiqDd9FA,@@govind315 I love the comments that love the comments that love the video.
17040,bfThiqDd9FA,Lower gravity and no atmosphere means particles can accelerate to almost light speed with no restrictions on their motion. 🫡
17041,bfThiqDd9FA,And mushrooms up like the moon has an atmosphere
17042,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s 100 miles per second or so. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. So, .05% C."
17043,bfThiqDd9FA,@@govind315he didnt. I did. It .05%
17044,bfThiqDd9FA,@@shayneoneill1506i got .05% so i was close.
17045,bfThiqDd9FA,More people need to know what things actually look like at astronomic scales.
17046,bfThiqDd9FA,Despite it being a vacuum
17047,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao
17048,bfThiqDd9FA,Also the size of the astroid. It must have been a monster seeing as how you can see it with a naked camera.
17049,bfThiqDd9FA,@@robertmaxwell4056 Did he just say that there's no gravity on the moon?
17050,bfThiqDd9FA,Flat earth brah!!  Moon aint that far away XD!
17051,bfThiqDd9FA,At 7fps:)
17052,bfThiqDd9FA,Its general zod😂
17053,bfThiqDd9FA,Also how the camera captures the clouds in 60fps while selectively filming the crash in 10fps
17054,bfThiqDd9FA,"Almost 12 million views.....Houston, mission accomplished"
17055,bfThiqDd9FA,"I may be wrong here but, since were behind in time with the time light takes to travel. Wouldn’t we still see the event normally? But about, 6-9 minutes or whatever after it takes light to travel to the moon to see it? Or were you saying something else?"
17056,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shanks0307 No.  The single second delay light takes to travel the distance from the moon to Earth would not result in the effect we see here so lightspeed is negligible. What we see in this video are dust particles traveling a quarter of the diameter of the moon in under 10 seconds.  That would mean these particles are traveling at 87 kilometers per second while they could only travel upwards at about 1/kps while taking into account the lower gravity of the moon.  Long story short, this video of the dust cloud on the moon would take about 15 minutes to fully form for an observer on Earth."
17057,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactamente
17058,bfThiqDd9FA,"I would estimate it as few hundreds km/sec., thousand times slower then the speed of light."
17059,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@govind315 he didn't.
17060,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@shayneoneill1506😮
17061,bfThiqDd9FA,Or the moon is about 2 km in diameter.
17062,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@shayneoneill1506 the initial ""debris speed"" directly after the impact was several times higher - so more than 0.1c ... Something so large that it was visible during day impacting at 0.1c would be at least a fraction of kilometer in size, so the energy released would cause a fireball brighter than the sun. The energy released would be ~a billion of Hiroshima bombs or about 1/20 of the one-second energy output of the Sun (in all directions) - so the surface brightness of the blast would be many times higher than surface of the Sun."
17063,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
17064,bfThiqDd9FA,And desapear so fast
17065,bfThiqDd9FA,And then it slows down rapidly due to the drag caused by the atmosphere on the moon. Oh wait
17066,bfThiqDd9FA,@@shayneoneill1506That would be around the speed of comercial airlines average speed. Are you sure?
17067,bfThiqDd9FA,with 30 frames per secound
17068,bfThiqDd9FA,@@derpskipfukington6578lol its ironic how serious you guy’s got after he was just more detailed about the speed. He could have been joking. Meanwhile you guys got super serious telling him not to be so serious. The irony.
17069,bfThiqDd9FA,"1/15 diameter of moon in 1 second = .0666 x 2,159 mi = 144 mi/s ÷ 186,000 mi/s = .000773 or .0773% speed of light - ballpark.

Ejecta from impact is likely going to be 3 mi/s, not 144 mi/s.

""meteorites from the moon and the strong probability that the 8 SNC (Shergottite, Nakhlite and Chassignite) meteorites originated on Mars indicate that large hypervelocity impacts eject some solid debris at very high speed (more than 2.5 and 5 km/sec in the above cases). The.."""
17070,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@derpskipfukington6578 then say half or a third speed of light. Specificity like 9% activates the nerd legion.

17074,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@derpskipfukington6578  His brain calculated everything very close to he speed of light.
17075,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@S.E.T.4Life I increased the frame rate of the explosion to be equal to the frame rate of the rest of the video. Premier tells me it's 30fps. Which increased the video on the moon by about 48%.

17137,bfThiqDd9FA,I have seen that too. I was landing on the moon that time.
17138,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s very cool how the moon is very big and how the dust cloud is the size of the tzar bomba
17139,bfThiqDd9FA,What a waste of time making this kind of videos
17140,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest thing ever
17141,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact formed a dust cloud thats almost the size of an entire continent in just under 3 seconds and then casually disappeared
17142,bfThiqDd9FA,i dotn believe this becuase the moon isnt that big usaully..and its day unless if there looking threw a telascope also it does kinda look photo shoped to meh
17143,bfThiqDd9FA,Must been a North Korean missile test.
17144,bfThiqDd9FA,That object would have to be ? miles across to be seen by the naked eye
17145,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂🤣
17146,bfThiqDd9FA,Hilarious 😂
17147,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah Yes, I'm Dead and this comment is just an Illusion."
17148,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahhaa that is so not what it would look like do you know anything about gravity and orbital velocity?
17149,bfThiqDd9FA,So we can see a mushroom cloud but no other features? Cmon man. I believe this as much as I believe Sleepy Joe won!
17150,bfThiqDd9FA,That clip is totally edid
17151,bfThiqDd9FA,You gotta admit this is pretty cool work for most people
17152,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they just happened to be filming the beautiful moon on the moment of impact.
17153,bfThiqDd9FA,nice Animation but you failed in Smoke effect
17154,bfThiqDd9FA,Just about every comment but the one pinned was based on wisdom and humor.
17155,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow a pure computer graphics good job bro
17156,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the birds are chirping and how the moon dust resembles a trains choo choo

17158,bfThiqDd9FA,"Y la estela, como sube tan rápido el bueno digamos polvo lunar y un sin número de etc, más??"
17159,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how clearly you can see the moon during the day
17160,bfThiqDd9FA,Ikr I see it all day
17161,bfThiqDd9FA,definitly easier if theres no clouds or lots trees around
17162,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust particles covered 1300 km distance in just 3 sec 🤣🤣🤣
17163,bfThiqDd9FA,Some people will ask me how do you know -- its simple radius of moon is approx 1700km and dust particles covered around three forth of the Radius
17164,bfThiqDd9FA,@@aniketsachan200 u still don't know how much tho
17165,bfThiqDd9FA,@@fathergascoigne2450 then tell me professor 🙂
17166,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit man.. keep it up 👍 next time don't forget to add Physics to it!
17167,bfThiqDd9FA,Stupid people believe stupid shit.
17168,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope who ever or whatever crashed on the moon is ok
17169,bfThiqDd9FA,love how most comments start With i love how

That was a nuke with a led light on the front from another side of the world that isn’t round or flat.."
17176,bfThiqDd9FA,"Here’s some things these moon crash videos always mess up, there would be no mushroom cloud, the moon has no atmosphere, so there’s nothing to pick
The dust up, in reality, the dust would just fling across the moon’s surface"
17177,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom shape?
17178,bfThiqDd9FA,I never seen this before
17179,bfThiqDd9FA,Happy it wasn't at us
17180,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon just farted
17181,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon that big…
17182,bfThiqDd9FA,You tell me.
17183,bfThiqDd9FA,!   !   !

17189,bfThiqDd9FA,You can almost see Wile E. Coyote smashing into the moon after that Acme rocket launch....🤣🤣🤣
17190,bfThiqDd9FA,Congratulation to tree branches for their acting performance
17191,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s the most impossible thing I’ve seen
17192,bfThiqDd9FA,The smoke and dust just went up in space as high as half the diameter of moon in nust 2 seconds. Gravity🤣🤣
17193,bfThiqDd9FA,How did the knew that was going to happen and he recorded this
17194,bfThiqDd9FA,Why would someone waste their valuable time making this obviously bs video?
17195,bfThiqDd9FA,seems legit
17196,bfThiqDd9FA,Just stop!
17197,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is vacuum so it will not develop a mushroom cloud
17198,bfThiqDd9FA,It's not a mushroom cloud dose the moon have clouds?
17199,bfThiqDd9FA,@@fathergascoigne2450 no moon doesnt have atmosphere thus it does not have clouds or anything
17200,bfThiqDd9FA,@@blixerr2668 I already know bro
17201,bfThiqDd9FA,Great photoshop.
17202,bfThiqDd9FA,mmmmm the moon has earth gravity now?
17203,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how everyone in the comments section loves something or the other.
17204,bfThiqDd9FA,lmao
17205,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon wouldn't show that bright in the day time
17206,bfThiqDd9FA,People are starving and things are corrupt.this is what you do with your time America?!
17207,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't think dust clouds would have a mushroom shape in a vacuum
17208,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah that not what would look like at all.   A plume that size would have created a flash bright enough to see in the day time.
a plume moving at that speed would also have giant boulders and lava being thrown out from the impact. 
That impactor would have changed the moons orbit. 
But the editing was great.   We’ll done."
17209,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how
17210,bfThiqDd9FA,Did you record this on a toaster?
17211,bfThiqDd9FA,"the moon is getting high, love it"

17224,bfThiqDd9FA,That proves the moon has air and is not far away.
17225,bfThiqDd9FA,Now how can you see a crash on the moon? And what kind of crash throws smoke that high? The moon ain’t no solid rock like a cookie. It has a surface. Idiots!
17226,bfThiqDd9FA,Matter couldn't physically erupt that fast from the moon.
17227,bfThiqDd9FA,it's easy to find people these day.

17277,bfThiqDd9FA,"Imagine that was a sonic boom from the moon at 240, 000 miles to Earth, we would hear it as a kaboom"
17278,bfThiqDd9FA,We would hear nothing because sound doesn’t have anything to travel through in space.
17279,bfThiqDd9FA,"Cool special effects, but it is grossly over-exaggerated. In order for the object to appear that large from the distances involved, It would have to be the size of dwarf planet Ceres to have caused the impact shown. And the ejecta blasted from the surface of the Moon in this proportion would probably spell our Doom. Because in all likelyhood,  the Earth's gravity would capture that debris which would result in a catastrophic impact on Earth. But very cool special effects!!!👍"
17280,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
17281,bfThiqDd9FA,😂

17307,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahaahahahahaahhahhahaha
17308,bfThiqDd9FA,This proves that the moon is only about 30-50 miles from earth.
17309,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud disappears after a few seconds.
17310,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the rocket impacts exactly at the visible edge between surface and sky.
17311,bfThiqDd9FA,Not fishy at all. Pure coincidence right?

17351,bfThiqDd9FA,Almost as believable as the moon landings....Almost.
17352,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 I can’t tell if you are being ironic or you are being serious with that
17353,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss  If your asking if I believe we put a man on the moon the answer is no.
17354,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 bruh
17355,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss  I would appeal to your  open mind to look at the work of Bart sibel. The fact it would be impossible to take pics on the moon due to the high levels of radiation let alone survive the journey through the van Allen belt. Just 2 reasons of many.
17356,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 the radiation on the moon is not harmful in short periods only in long terms and that means the moon is safe to explore also the van allen belts is also safe to pass through as long as you don’t stay in there for a long time…
17357,bfThiqDd9FA,@Jakethemoss Then whys nobody been back since? You cannot take pictures on the moon and expect them to develop so clearly. Especially on the light side. It was all faked. Have you seen Bart sibels channel? Or the work of Richard Hall? The moon rock being petrified wood?
17358,bfThiqDd9FA,@@AllOuttaBubblegum123 why nobody has been back? Cuz it wasn’t something that was going to happen but it is being talked about again also yes you can easily take pictures on the light side of the moon if it was on the dark side we couldn’t see anything at all also if it was faked then why is it you can see the American flag with a just a good telescope you need a good one like very expensive ones but you can see it up there there is no way that can be there for no reason
17359,bfThiqDd9FA,"@Jakethemoss  OK. It's nice to have a polite debate with someone. Show me a picture from a telescope that shows the flag. There isn't one. It's a myth. Don't you find it awfully convenient that Kennedy promised the landing before the 60s ended and it just so supposedly happened in 69? Have you look at my suggestion of the channel Bart Sibel or the documentary ""a funny thing happened on the way to the moon"" There is an interview with Nasa from not long ago where they state with not gone to the moon as we have forgotten how or don't have the technology. I was like you for decades then I did some independent research. The analysis of the astronauts interviews by Peter Hyatt is also very telling."

2. The diameter of the moon is 2,100 miles.  this thing travels over 5 times  it's  diameter  in 13 seconds. 

Let's work the math:  10,500 miles in 13 seconds = 48,000 miles per minute, which equates to  about 2.8 million miles per hour, which equates to give me an effing BREAK lolol"

17407,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well, hypothetically irl, that ejecta would be expanding for hours or probably days... but it would be more of a punch bowl-shaped cone as space doesn't billow things into mushroom clouds. It would probably consist of glowing magma too as that's a HUGE impact... like probably a crater the size of Texas. This hypothetical scenario would probably be bad news for us... I assume it would be... if the moon got nudged into a more eccentric orbit or something."

17417,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought that too but ufos happen so randomly that we get these shakey blurry images! But this is in 100% focused and in detail.. plus the size difference that rocket would have to be HUGE to see from earth

17435,bfThiqDd9FA,Trick photography
17436,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm not an expert but I'm thinking that the dust debri cloud would take way more amount of time from our distance from earth to reach that amount of plummage. That sucker looked miles high from the moons surface.
17437,bfThiqDd9FA,In regards to comments I have read. I did not account for lack of gravity as well and how it would affect its expanding trajectory dispersal.

17444,bfThiqDd9FA,What makes the mushroom cloud form and shape on earth? The atmosphere. The ejection debris on the moon would have taken the form of a cone with the moon’s  gravity causing the top edges to curl outward IF it was a direct hit. The visual appearance of the object would have made it over 3 kilometers long and 1 kilometer in diameter.  SO….BUSTED!!!
17445,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how my butt jiggles.
17446,bfThiqDd9FA,"if something is big enough to be visible drom day at the distance of the moon than its at least 50km and this is am MINIMUM and at such speeds that it is visibly moving like that, your moon would have been destroyed and you too with it"

17486,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@clarezajac3276 I didnt say ""visibility"". I said the moon doesn't COME OUT during the middle of the day. Meaning the moon should have already been set at this point of the day, not at the top of the sky where it is at in this video. The position in which the moon is here, the sun would have had to be accenting or rising. But the sky is too bright for sunset or sunrise. Do you understand?"

17544,bfThiqDd9FA,At first I thought moon was gonna crash to Earth
17545,bfThiqDd9FA,"4 seconds to  cross moon diameter of 2000miles - so 500miles/sec  -. That is x42 faster than Chicxulub asteroid impact that wiped out dinosaurs and most of life on earth - so kinetic energy would 42^2=  147 times more (if same mass).
But that looks to be at least 25mile across (definitely not a rocket! 😆🤣).Lets assume an asteroid  3 times size chicxulub so mass estimated = 3^3 ~9x .
  All in all impact energy =147x9 =1,323 more than a thousand times the energy than what nearly wiped out life on Earth.

Just checked numbers  -Chicxulub was 100million Megatons - so this would be 132 billion Megatonnes  - 100 Billion nuclear weapons (average size) ---all on a body with 1/80th mass and less 1/10th surface area of Earth. At least half the moon (or all of moon) surface would be re-landscaped as molten lava by this impact and much ejecta thrown onto the Earth as well causing immense havoc and endangerment to lif on Earth. Here we see instead a puff of smoke. That show's we know THIS IS FAKE."

17560,bfThiqDd9FA,"MY SCIENTIFIC ANALASYS... relative to the size of the moon the size of that object would have to be at LEAST 1-2 kilometers in size,  3,281-6,562 feet, the Burj Khalifa is the tallest building at 2,717ft. So just an estimate, that rocket would have to be the size of about 2 of the worlds tallest building, the tallest rocket being 363 feet, it's unlikely, the sea of tranquility (on the moon) is 873km wide, reference that with the size of the object, that's where I'm getting these lower end results, in reality it might be the size of 4-5 berj Khalifa's, and the size of the cloud is more like 500 berj's, imagine something the size of the length of Florida, being hurled at the moon. SO  in short this is very false if your saying it's a rocket, if it's a huge comet, (massive) it could make similar results, the cloud may not be so big, I haven't heard anything from the telescope people or the people that constantly are surveying the moon so I'd say fake news"

17622,bfThiqDd9FA,The plume rises to an altitude that is nearly a quarter of Moon's radius in less than four seconds. That gives a ejection speed of more than 100km/sec. The speed of  🦕 killing bolide is estimated to be 30 km/s. Generally ejecta travel much slower than projectile.

17645,bfThiqDd9FA,Interesting how the framerate of the impact is wildly different to that of the rest of the video.

17655,bfThiqDd9FA,the only thing missing is that the explosion would have been heard to be my favorite video hahahaha ❤

17670,bfThiqDd9FA,@@d3203 why is it? Btw i am in yours
17671,bfThiqDd9FA,@@h.a.-hyperants1262 Because the moon does just disappeare because the sun rises. It still deflects the suns light even when its still over the horizon.
17672,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@d3203 But it cant reflect light this much, moon can only reflect small amount of sun's light. The video is really sunny. When there is no sun seen and moon rises then it will be dark which is called night. But it is sunny like 1pm suns light."

17678,bfThiqDd9FA,"Okie dokie. Remember folks, this is why basic physical science (hot, cold, up, down, gravity, centrifugal force etc.) is taught in grade school. So that you understand how stuff works.
1. How long does it take for an earth launched rocket to reach impact with the moon? Swear ta' god, if you were born before 1965, you better know the answer to that. (Four days)
2. From a human eye perspective, would we be able to see an impact like that? (No, we have stuff like atmosphere, and pollution)
3. If the impact was so massive that we could see it from earth, with our naked eyes, what would that mean? (Immediately call your insurance agent, and purchase meteorite insurance for your home) uhhhh nothing, nothing would happen...uh,  well gotta go, bye."
17679,bfThiqDd9FA,North Korea has not got it down pat yet or they are frustrated 🥴 😂

17710,bfThiqDd9FA,Look like a nasty fart by the moon
17711,bfThiqDd9FA,I wonder how long the dust cloud would be visible (if at all) if this really happened.
17712,bfThiqDd9FA,There wouldn’t even be a dust cloud
17713,bfThiqDd9FA,Its like Moon has some gas issue.

17719,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@peeraulleeshameemgoolam5351 Everyone has seen it.  But most don’t notice it or wonder why we see it, so often, while the sun is present when it should be on the other side of the world."

17721,bfThiqDd9FA,I say this to people at work all the time and they look at me like im nuts. But bro you can see the moon 24/7 wherever you are and no one bats an eye?

17723,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Randommemessssss I know.  I heard that the French aren’t seeing much at all as of late, but red because of the crippling sanctions that they levied on Russia at the direction of the United States.  But, the United States isn’t suffering, only European countries are."
17724,bfThiqDd9FA,@@brianweirich8185 I know!  I’m surprised at how long it took me to simply look up.

17726,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Randommemessssss I can’t understand why European countries are doing this to themselves.  But, the French aren’t known as people who just lie down and take it.  It’s amazing what they are doing though.  It’s like the leaders there want their mansions surrounded.  It seems like the US is breaking and de-industrializing Europe intentionally.

17727,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@martell203 the whole of Europe is destroying itself with the sanctions against Putin and his country, the presidents raise ALL the prices saying ""yeah well it's made in Ukraine huh"" they use war for money.  and in addition Putin threatens nuclear weapons, we are in deep s***"

Not hating but this is why we need better science teachers smh...the moon literally right now is visible by the night and sun covered space of earth. YouTube it and get your knowledge up. Did you also know that in the north pole they have a night cycle that lasts like 6 to 9 months straight? Lmao."
17731,bfThiqDd9FA,@@anthonyzullo You should re-evaluate the things that you think you know.  I have my knowledge up.  Thanks for your concern though.

17734,bfThiqDd9FA,@branden burks  hi im gonna tell you a thing that will explain it all. The earth is not round its an egg form. The sides are longer. Fun fact number 2 water is not locked to the land. Moon and other planets gravity cause it to actualy somewhat be a big ass water buble. We cant see the moon  every day but yes some spots where earth is flatter you prob will see it less. Tide goes by 2 times a day. That is also a cause by this.

Because if you write to me again that you have difficulty understanding my writings, we will have to look for thee problem somewhere else instead at me."
17761,bfThiqDd9FA,@@parasitelights3158 Stick to your first language for your weak insults.  One or two of them might even land.  And I mean land in an actual and meaningful way.  Not the way that NASA actors “landed” on the moon.
17762,bfThiqDd9FA,"ok everyone, here's how it works.
1. The moon is in the visible part of the sky 12hrs a day.
2. If it's close to the sun (ie. a new moon, or sliver) the sun will be too bright (and the moon too thin) to see it until the sun is very low or has set. 
3. The moon will be VISIBLE in the daytime when it's a little way away from the sun (ie a few days after new moon until a few days before full moon). That's nearly two weeks, say 10 days.
4. You may then see the full moon rising at around sunset, but it will get dark before it gets very high.
5. For the next two weeks - this is confusing - the moon goes back from full to a sliver (old moon) but leads the sun across the sky instead of following it (with the shadow on the other side). ie it goes through full and starts rising AFTER sunset (with the shadow on the other side) and setting BEFORE sunRISE. when you'll see it for a while. In the morning. Before it sets. Over the next two weeks the moon leads the sun across the sky instead of following it, but will be visible in the day sky like before. Finally, it will become a sliver again but be visible in the day for a while AFTER sunRISE (instead of before sunset) until the sun gets too bright. Then (for the next couple of days) it goes 'past' the sun and starts again, as a new moon (see top).

Bottom line: You will see the moon during the day, at least for a while, for most of the month. You'll only see it high in the sky and for most of the day around first and last quarter. Around new and full moons, you'll only see it in the day for a couple of hours, low in the sky.

17857,bfThiqDd9FA,"The wind must have blown away the dust cloud. 

Good thing space isn’t a vacuum. 

Nice try but only a serious conspiracy ( or flat Earther) nut would fall for this nonsense."
17858,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon smok
17859,bfThiqDd9FA,Trash but 3.7Million views... 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
17860,bfThiqDd9FA,That is a cloud that's solve
17861,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice animation
17862,bfThiqDd9FA,Фейк
17863,bfThiqDd9FA,great editing
17864,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well the moon isn’t a physical object it’s plasma and holographic in nature, always at a right angle to the viewer with the same face, so nothings going to crash into it. Ever."
17865,bfThiqDd9FA,So that's where I put my Star Destroyer. Hate it when that happens....
17866,bfThiqDd9FA,Cute.
17867,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well, im no expert but that moon is a little too close to the earth,"
17868,bfThiqDd9FA,thought it was a moon fart😏
17869,bfThiqDd9FA,WTF? 😳
17870,bfThiqDd9FA,Description looks like it was done by software… much like this video
17871,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn that happened on my birthday this year
17872,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s saitama
17873,bfThiqDd9FA,"I can't See Shit

Yet just watched a something hit the MOON 😆"
17874,bfThiqDd9FA,Drone 🐦 in the background.
17875,bfThiqDd9FA,love how the asteroid is moving at/faster than the speed of light
17876,bfThiqDd9FA,No it isn’t. Light is much faster.
17877,bfThiqDd9FA,"thats not an astroid. its the moon, you...whatever. havent you seen one bafore?"
17878,bfThiqDd9FA,Ficedula parva?
17879,bfThiqDd9FA,"No,that's Saitama farting back to earth during cosmic garou fight"
17880,bfThiqDd9FA,"If this is true, then why wasn't it on the news?"
17881,bfThiqDd9FA,thanks for the fodder! love reading the comments
17882,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow original video 😂
17883,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦
17884,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice video animation 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
17885,bfThiqDd9FA,Чушь собачья.
17886,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty good video editing dust cloud would still be there though takes along time for gravity of the moon to settle the dust
17887,bfThiqDd9FA,The crazy thing is on march 4th its my birthday.....
17888,bfThiqDd9FA,3 m views. Good for you
17889,bfThiqDd9FA,Wkwkwkwkwk...
17890,bfThiqDd9FA,Оооочень хуевый рендер... Ну прям максимально низкий FPS 16
17891,bfThiqDd9FA,"Believe it or not.. call me crazy! I have experienced the exact same thing in 98 when I was a young boy.. It just wasn't as big as this, but a celestial object definitely hit the moon.. It was a really tiiiny white dot, almost about the size of an ant, but big enough to be visible, just like when you see a plane in the sky! I remember I was watching this thing getting closer and closer to the moon, I was with my mother and I asked her what is this thing??? she could see it too, and she said I have noooo idea. Soon as she said that, this little ""white dot"" hit the moon, and I swear to God you could see dust from the impact.. I will never in my life forget what me and my mother both saw on this morning.. back then I thought it was a spaceship 😂 cause I didn't know no better, I was a kid.. But today I'm convinced it was a biig rock maybe an asteroid that hit the moon."
17892,bfThiqDd9FA,"We’ll all of that was a lie because all of that is not physically possible. They would not be a dust cloud ejecting from the surface, and the object would not be visible to the naked eye from earth. If it was it would be enough to break the moon into pieces."
17893,bfThiqDd9FA,@@T_Bagz193 alright like I said believe it or not
17894,bfThiqDd9FA,"I can do better editing than that, come on mate!"

17897,bfThiqDd9FA,It could happen!! Never knooooOOHHHoow
17898,bfThiqDd9FA,Did the moon just fart?
17899,bfThiqDd9FA,That was Saitama

17901,bfThiqDd9FA,What is this? The start of moonfall on earth
17902,bfThiqDd9FA,If you believe this then it’s time for your covid vaccine booster😂
17903,bfThiqDd9FA,Yaha toh moon bhi paad maar raha h 😂😂
17904,bfThiqDd9FA,Montague
17905,bfThiqDd9FA,More information needed please
17906,bfThiqDd9FA,You really don't believe this do you? 😂
17907,bfThiqDd9FA,I do believe it I needed more information about this
17908,bfThiqDd9FA,@@robocop5257 🤣🤣 what a nerd
17909,bfThiqDd9FA,Editt
17910,bfThiqDd9FA,I missed the collision I just caught what appeared to be the moon cutting ass with a massive fart 💨
17911,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in the day light..cmon kiddo
17912,bfThiqDd9FA,"What the hell If there is no gravity and like example a nuke, the explosion will be like a bubble not like a mushroom cloud bruh 💀💀💀💀💀"
17913,bfThiqDd9FA,wrong date: 1st of april is correct  ;-)
17914,bfThiqDd9FA,After effect : 4/10… review some stuff
17915,bfThiqDd9FA,Who ever made this crap has no understanding in basic physics. This is why any artist should be educated in basic science
17916,bfThiqDd9FA,This is just like her jewelries.
17917,bfThiqDd9FA,"Fuck the cloud, the moon is clearly Visible in Daylight."
17918,bfThiqDd9FA,It wouldn’t be going that fast.
17919,bfThiqDd9FA,Imagine filming the moon randomly in the day time and seeing this rocket hundreds of thousands miles away without even zooming in. Nice camera though
17920,bfThiqDd9FA,"You forgot to add the shock ring à la Praxis, the moon orbiting Qo'noS' in Star Trek."
17921,bfThiqDd9FA,They’re gonna f*ck around and kill us all.
17922,bfThiqDd9FA,How do you like that Obama?
17923,bfThiqDd9FA,Din me Chand dekhne ka mjahi kuch alg h
17924,bfThiqDd9FA,That mushroom cloud with a moon with no atmosphere?
17925,bfThiqDd9FA,It's freeza hahah
17926,bfThiqDd9FA,My bad I crash landed
17927,bfThiqDd9FA,Shenanigans!!!🤥
17928,bfThiqDd9FA,It happend a day before my birthday
17929,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice one ....what did you do it in? Blender?
17930,bfThiqDd9FA,It's the comments section for me.
17931,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of baloney.
17932,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakers will say it’s hate
17933,bfThiqDd9FA,I was wondering where my rocket went
17934,bfThiqDd9FA,"Very impressive video editing. This, however would be a catastrophic event for the moon and by extension, the Earth."
17935,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s clouds behind the moon because the moon is inside the firmament
17936,bfThiqDd9FA,Screw this kind of channel. Thumbs down and put in no recommendation list.
17937,bfThiqDd9FA,Seriously?? You have to use stupid clickbait titles to get an audience 😅
17938,bfThiqDd9FA,nt🤣
17939,bfThiqDd9FA,I luv how so many people luv things in this video
17940,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂👍👍
17941,bfThiqDd9FA,2/10..  try harder
17942,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like my husband went to the moon and farted 🤣
17943,bfThiqDd9FA,{[made in VFX]}
17944,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon farter, that's all."
17945,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣👍
17946,bfThiqDd9FA,..... but we can't see an asteroid the size of Texas that far away in broad daylight with the naked eye....🤔😐
17947,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wait a minute, how moon appears on daytime time"
17948,bfThiqDd9FA,"ah ah ah  !!!  montage vidéo bien sûr, évidement , mais c'est bien fait bravo !  jolie trucage ."
17949,bfThiqDd9FA,4th March is my crush's Bday❤️😂
17950,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the video is 24 fps with 5 fps vfx
17951,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the impact moved the moon due to the movement of the clouds.
17952,bfThiqDd9FA,No air on the moon man.
17953,bfThiqDd9FA,Huh? Whaa…where am I? Is this the other side of the internet?
17954,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny as I was waiting for an explosion and the object to exit the opposite side of the moon.
17955,bfThiqDd9FA,Sembra reale... un impatto da asteroide
17956,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon Just farted..!! 🤣🤣
17957,bfThiqDd9FA,*dying of cring*
17958,bfThiqDd9FA,And that stupid next video thumbnail popped at last before even completing and couldn't see what happened to the cloud of dust 🤯😠
17959,bfThiqDd9FA,Someone is getting a laugh.
17960,bfThiqDd9FA,Holy hell
17961,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon so big
17962,bfThiqDd9FA,"Meow meow moo meow, right?"
17963,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow, the impact must've been so bad that it caused the dust cloud to play at 20 fps"
17964,bfThiqDd9FA,This is faker than Kim kardashian
17965,bfThiqDd9FA,You need to practice more in editing dude
17966,bfThiqDd9FA,that actually made me laugh 🤣
17967,bfThiqDd9FA,This was on my birthday....
17968,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart…..
17969,bfThiqDd9FA,Video editing
17970,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't believe da hype.
17971,bfThiqDd9FA,"We’ll see what you see. I’m saying 😮Bull Shit
think about what you just saw."
17972,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama was kicked by Boros.. Nice..
17973,bfThiqDd9FA,"Impossible, even if something hit the moon, we wouldn't see any gas or vapor leaving our satellite until minutes plus leaving its atmosphere completely requires nuclear power/impact, the scene would be more impressive than this."
17974,bfThiqDd9FA,Mas trucho que..
17975,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
17976,bfThiqDd9FA,Smd
17977,bfThiqDd9FA,If the video was released on April the 1st than it has been more realistic
17978,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the cloud  just disappeared...like a fart
17979,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
17980,bfThiqDd9FA,I SAW THIS TOO!
17981,bfThiqDd9FA,Bruh u must haven't seen it if its already night
17982,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this for reel? Or it’s camera tric
17983,bfThiqDd9FA,"Saitama, is that you?"
17984,bfThiqDd9FA,??.!
17985,bfThiqDd9FA,Yawn...I had eggs for breakfast
17986,bfThiqDd9FA,It must be a asteroid or a spaceship
17987,bfThiqDd9FA,Bardock: Shit! Ginae! we overshot!
17988,bfThiqDd9FA,"Jor El: Uh, Honey.. It seem's Cal's pod has decided to take a detour..."
17989,bfThiqDd9FA,when i saw the thumbnail my first thought was *how can the moon fart*
17990,bfThiqDd9FA,like how this clip was supposedly on my birthday 🤪
17991,bfThiqDd9FA,Clearly the creator doesn’t understand the fundamental properties of the physical world. Time to study up before you trick me 🫢
17992,bfThiqDd9FA,"amazing, it the China created moon"
17993,bfThiqDd9FA,"After reading a few comments I must say most of you guys are funny! And the main thing a comedian needs to be funny is to be is smart because stupid isn't funny, it's pitiful!  And, stupid isn't sexy either BTW! So I enjoyed the comments along with being reassured that stupid in fact is not the new normal thank God or whoever!  I am also not a bad photographer, videographer and watcher of the Moon, the Shuttle when it was in commission, our I.S.S., the Chinese space station Tiangong and our stars nightly.  I was 8 when we walked on the Moon so I've never known life without a space program. I never knew a life without the NFL either until it went gangster and the players couldn't even shut up long enough to pay homage to our fallen soldiers who gave their lives that they might play a game for a living and live comfortably well off for the rest of their lives so see what I mean? There is no virtue in stupid. And it's nice to know there are more of us than there is of them!"
17994,bfThiqDd9FA,It wouldn't produce a mushroom cloud with no atmosphere.
17995,bfThiqDd9FA,bullshit
17996,bfThiqDd9FA,The frame rate of the explosion is not the same of the rest of the video. Watch the clouds compared the the explosion.
17997,bfThiqDd9FA,time is slower in space and on the moon so it'd be a bit slower
17998,bfThiqDd9FA,It's because the moon's not that far away you have to use common sense the moon and the sun are so close it's not funny everything you've been taught is definitely a lie
17999,bfThiqDd9FA,How is the dirt flying in space like in earth? And in which side that impact occurred normal or dark side?🤔🤔🤔
18000,bfThiqDd9FA,Horrible skill
18001,bfThiqDd9FA,A mushroom cloud? 400 miles tall and 300 miles wide? mmmmm
18002,bfThiqDd9FA,what is the black object under the moon just under the moon if you editor to zoom in you can see? and why does the debris dissipate so quick?
18003,bfThiqDd9FA,"O, woe betide the tides tonight!"
18004,bfThiqDd9FA,"You all talking about frame rates, you know ANYONE that would witness this, and just remain totally silent? Plus you'd think the news would have mentioned this. And why was someone just casually filming the moon in broad daylight?"
18005,bfThiqDd9FA,"The scale isn't quite right, but B+ for effort."
18006,bfThiqDd9FA,we never been on the moon fucken internet turned people into fucken idiots bro I swear
18007,bfThiqDd9FA,You all shut the f up with your I like the way and I love how. Just shut up
18008,bfThiqDd9FA,So why didn’t the one who filmed this react at all?
18009,bfThiqDd9FA,Irrelevant cause nothing is in the right shape. Plus idyllic birdsongs from the garden
18010,bfThiqDd9FA,I can’t believe we watched it till the end or took the time to make these comments.   We really need to get a life.
18011,bfThiqDd9FA,"That was a 3 ton rocket part striking moon at 5,800 mph……NASA"
18012,bfThiqDd9FA,"Omg I would had never had thought this..... how did you get the moon a white as the clouds, that is some HD camera my eyes don't even see the moon as that white"
18013,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom clouds cannot exist on the moon because the moon has no atmosphere
18014,bfThiqDd9FA,I've always wondered where Puff the Magic Dragon has been.
18015,bfThiqDd9FA,"It hits the moon exactly on the edge, as seen from the observer's point of view, so we can assume its trajectory is perpendicular to it. It could be wrong but let's pretend it's right. Since It takes about twelve seconds to cover a distance that is equal to three diameters of the moon, we can assume it travels at about 900km (560ml)/sec. If it's not perpendicular to us, then it's even faster. No way. The only thing sillier than this video its me wasting my time making very rough calculations and then posting this comment. 😂😂😂 At least, i can spare a like..."
18016,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a load of bollocks
18017,bfThiqDd9FA,How flat earthers astronomy is about
18018,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahah sure :D
18019,bfThiqDd9FA,To make this convincing you needed an accretion disc
18020,bfThiqDd9FA,"It wasn't a crash or space rock, the moon just farted"
18021,bfThiqDd9FA,ajajjaaja
18022,bfThiqDd9FA,"The crash was so powerful the smoke was laggy, clearly the simulation couldn't handle the particle effects."
18023,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO what a crock of shit. Why upload lies and BS people??? Get off the internet.
18024,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this an orb crashing into the moon? I've caught afew of them hovering and shooting off at insane super speeds
18025,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon farting
18026,bfThiqDd9FA,R.I.P rocket ??? - 4th of March 2022
18027,bfThiqDd9FA,This breaking news brought to you by commodore 64 graphics suite
18028,bfThiqDd9FA,😂🧢
18029,bfThiqDd9FA,Makes a wish
18030,bfThiqDd9FA,This has got to be edited
18031,bfThiqDd9FA,It would be impossible for the moon to get a mushroom cloud explosion it would be more like a circle
18032,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣☝️
18033,bfThiqDd9FA,How it is not possible
18034,bfThiqDd9FA,😕
18035,bfThiqDd9FA,🤡🤡🤡
18036,bfThiqDd9FA,"Absolute bollocks, the dust just disappeared 🙄"
18037,bfThiqDd9FA,Imagine if it hit the earth
18038,bfThiqDd9FA,Terrible chi when it hits the clouds. Should've been dim not completely gone dummy.
18039,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn’t have my glasses… whoops…
18040,bfThiqDd9FA,"Rabbim sen Hıfzı muhafaza et sevdiklerimi ve bu dünyayı  insanlığı, sen koru Allah'ım Amin 🤲 sizleride Allah islamitetle şereflendirsin inşallah bunu okuyan Kıymetli insanlar.araştırın gerçeği bulun inanın kurtuluşunuz İslamdır sadece biraz İslamiyeti araştırın hepimiz bir gün öleceğiz ama inançla imanla ölelim kurtuluşumuz  Müslümanlıkta ama gerçek  müslümanlıkta akıllı insanlarsınız bulacaksınız hakikati inşallah 🤲👍🍀"
18041,bfThiqDd9FA,mushroom clouds only happen in gravity in space it don't do that and you wouldn't see it from earth any way.
18042,bfThiqDd9FA,"It doesn't seem like a Crash
OMG! Did The Just Fartedd????"
18043,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
18044,bfThiqDd9FA,"So this happened on my Bday?
Power must have been over 9,000

Y so serious 😈🃏🥃"
18045,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you know how fast that thing had to have been been traveling to see if moving that fast from that far away?
18046,bfThiqDd9FA,LMAO! I love how this moon is 40x bigger than ours and has an atmosphere. What's the name of this planet?
18047,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
18048,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
18049,bfThiqDd9FA,To troll my 9 year old son tonight before bed or not to troll....
18050,bfThiqDd9FA,That's sum great editing
18051,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice special effects bro
18052,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's be fair. This was a media film class project that his teacher even laughed at!!!
18053,bfThiqDd9FA,"to me, the dust cloud becomes a heart at the end--nice touch:)"
18054,bfThiqDd9FA,Why are you dredging into the moon??
18055,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how there is smoke coming from the impact
10/10 realism"
18056,bfThiqDd9FA,"I don't BELIEVE IT!!!
First of all how could this person just randomly happened to point their camera in the direction of the moon during the day at the exact moment a supposed asteroid is about hit it? Do you know how far the moon is to earth!?! Honestly, do you really think we are that dumb to think we would see dust come off the moon!?!
And remember there's no gravity in space no air so do you think it would make a mushroom shape like if a bomb hit it!?!
This camera person knows cinematography and how to do special effects.
Go make movies instead of trying to fool people with your make believe stories."
18057,bfThiqDd9FA,"The smoke made a nuclear mushroom cloud, meaning air would have to push it in order to make it. And due to no diffusion, the ploom of smoke wouldn’t have gone away."
18058,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
18059,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember this like it was yesterday.
18060,bfThiqDd9FA,Its cap
18061,bfThiqDd9FA,"Alright so um, that’s an edit."
18062,bfThiqDd9FA,Did the moon just fart? 💨
18063,bfThiqDd9FA,Elon musk: W T F
18064,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes..that is saitama landing on the moon during fighting with lord boros..
18065,bfThiqDd9FA,"So first it's a rocket part, then it's a chunk of space junk. Then it's an out of control rocket. Then it's just a rocket booster. Whatever it REALLY was, here on youtube it amounted to nothing more than a big waste of time. This video is indicative of the brainstorms of MEAT farts which are currently determining the greater course of humanity, led by the Ronald McDonald is finally in the White House regime."
18066,bfThiqDd9FA,What???   BS!
18067,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the camera shakes so realistically
18068,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
18069,bfThiqDd9FA,Oliver is in love everyone 💕 ❤ congratulations Oliver 👏 for coming out
18070,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker than makeup
18071,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's clearly day time the moon would barely be visible, in a completely different location, and a third of the size"
18072,bfThiqDd9FA,bro the moon is so huge these days
18073,bfThiqDd9FA,"I was there it happened. It was around 12 noon of 29/02/22. It was very bright and hurting my myopic eyes but I somehow managed to keep them open. Post collision sounded like 10 nuclear bombs going off simultaneously. People will say I'm lying, but I dare them to prove me wrong!!"
18074,bfThiqDd9FA,You know we are living in 2022 when you see the moon itself smoking weed
18075,bfThiqDd9FA,And then the cloud disappeared after the next videos pop up and shit
18076,bfThiqDd9FA,इतने बडे cloud जो चांद का 15%hai 🤣
18077,bfThiqDd9FA,HAHAHHHAHHAHAHHA. Ok.
18078,bfThiqDd9FA,Awesome
18079,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try but no cigar.
18080,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah this view is definitely from a different location (from his room where he edited this).
Great going amateur astronomer."
18081,bfThiqDd9FA,I like the way the dust cloud can billow up like that when there's no atmosphere.
18082,bfThiqDd9FA,Loving the guy just randomly recording the moon and having no reaction to an event um pretty sure would cause at least tsunamis on earth
18083,bfThiqDd9FA,So that dart project is really about something whole different. To knock planets out of orbit. The Earth for example.
18084,bfThiqDd9FA,Хорошая компьютерная графика
18085,bfThiqDd9FA,Please stop the B/S.
18086,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂 moon fart
18087,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud traveled faster than light
18088,bfThiqDd9FA,"Where's the sound, bro?"
18089,bfThiqDd9FA,through the space is no sound.
18090,bfThiqDd9FA,Too much bird sound
18091,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the moon is so big and it’s bright in the morning! Perfect time to see a rocket hit a 238,900 mi far away planet🤪💀"
18092,bfThiqDd9FA,"My mom: ""I took a break from watching Tucker Carlson and saw this video of a crash on the moon!"""
18093,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon: Do I look like a freak?
😂"
18094,bfThiqDd9FA,"i love how its broad daylight, the moon is big as fuck and you can see the ""meteorite"" clear as day while it crashes into the goddamn moon"
18095,bfThiqDd9FA,The sarcasm in this comment section is next level😂😂
18096,bfThiqDd9FA,where is the haha button?
18097,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon was that close to us I would be panicking
18098,bfThiqDd9FA,Mf is seeing moon in broad daylight
18099,bfThiqDd9FA,"Не судите автора прикольно сделал, развлекательный контент. Не хуже чем во многих фильмах. Закидали человека негативом"
18100,bfThiqDd9FA,Poor moon :(
18101,bfThiqDd9FA,Монтаж
18102,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow that moon is massive 😂
18103,bfThiqDd9FA,Montagem bem feita
18104,bfThiqDd9FA,ROFLMAO
18105,bfThiqDd9FA,The speed calculation looks right and even the angular strike with ejecta plumb looks right....after careful analysis!
18106,bfThiqDd9FA,I doesn't  understand
18107,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn’t know the moon had a blowhole.
18108,bfThiqDd9FA,You see there was this swamp gas right? And uh uh!
18109,bfThiqDd9FA,That video is straight garbage.
18110,bfThiqDd9FA,"Jesus YouTube channels are really testing the stupidity of people with this one.

Acting like the moon is that small that the dust cloud would be seen from earth is preposterous and has zero relationship with reality.

Also the moon has very little gravity compared to earth, so that dust cloud wouldn’t even look like that."
18111,bfThiqDd9FA,Well that was fun I enjoyed several comments is this a movie shot from 1963? No just kidding😊
18112,bfThiqDd9FA,"For a second, i though the moon was farting 😂😂"
18113,bfThiqDd9FA,"May I suggest adding a few seconds of black at the end of the video, so that the links to other videos don’t block the images we’re watching?"
18114,bfThiqDd9FA,I always wondered where that baseball I hit went
18115,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart
18116,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is smoking but it's his choice
18117,bfThiqDd9FA,did she just fart?
18118,bfThiqDd9FA,how will this affect the economy? 😲😲
18119,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
18120,bfThiqDd9FA,3D animated vfx video created only
18121,bfThiqDd9FA,VIRTUAL VFX
18122,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm kinda hoping that the Saturn v rocket booster she'll that's being towed behind us in the Earth's gravity somehow gets bumped out of our gravity and crashes into the moon like that. Now that would be awesome to see from earth!
18123,bfThiqDd9FA,"Pretty neat, but the dust cloud moved away too fast. Pay attention to the other comments too. Keep up the good work!"
18124,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just farted.. sorry it looking faketo me
18125,bfThiqDd9FA,Ok so the moon farted. must be from all that cheese.
18126,bfThiqDd9FA,The level of snark in this comment section makes me happy
18127,bfThiqDd9FA,thats kind of a mid effect ngl why is it only like 2fps
18128,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing
18129,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s Sentinel Prime
18130,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahhahahahahaha wtf
18131,bfThiqDd9FA,Falsoooo no mamen
18132,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro its like moon got farted
18133,bfThiqDd9FA,"You know how close we would have to be to even see that cloud of smoke (especially in relation to the actual size of the moon)?  Not to mention atmospheric conditions (not necessarily by earth, maybe by or on the moon itself)?"
18134,bfThiqDd9FA,40 feet or so. my best guess.
18135,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow! What the hell was that? Was that a meteor or what?
18136,bfThiqDd9FA,Read the description. Its old rocket debris.
18137,bfThiqDd9FA,It's false like the moon landing
18138,bfThiqDd9FA,That was super man crash landed on the moon
18139,bfThiqDd9FA,Good work with adob  After effec
18140,bfThiqDd9FA,Anybody gonna talk about how that smoke cloud was... Idk bigger than equador?
18141,bfThiqDd9FA,The programming has a glitch
18142,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a humongous star planet. What we see happened quadrillion of trillions of years ago and the light has just reached us.
18143,bfThiqDd9FA,"Phony
Lame
Weak"
18144,bfThiqDd9FA,"top 10 fakest things ever, number 1:"
18145,bfThiqDd9FA,"Everyone else talking about the FX. I’m blown away by the acting. Cause seeing something that crazy. I too wouldn’t have made a sound, or anything. And just kept filming."
18146,bfThiqDd9FA,😆🤣😄😅
18147,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'll give you a 8 out of 10 on your special effects work, not bad ❗❕❗"
18148,bfThiqDd9FA,What kind of crap are you uploading to YouTube :(
18149,bfThiqDd9FA,"Everyone missed the most important part of the clip, that bird clearly is on drugs, gets better coke then I do."
18150,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a edit
18151,bfThiqDd9FA,your putting out junk to delude the actuall news for the moon crash in march.
18152,bfThiqDd9FA,Can't believe that this phony shit is still out here. LMAO
18153,bfThiqDd9FA,unrealistic. you have much to learn. also its not a nice thing to produce such fakes. you are naughty
18154,bfThiqDd9FA,It looked like the person crashed was Saitama
18155,bfThiqDd9FA,"Reminded me of Space Balls…call the Mega Maid.  😆
Ludicrous"
18156,bfThiqDd9FA,Simply shite...
18157,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how people randomly record the moon.
18158,bfThiqDd9FA,What this is animation?
18159,bfThiqDd9FA,pfff ridiculous
18160,bfThiqDd9FA,Dude you should work for Hollywood.
18161,bfThiqDd9FA,cap
18162,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun fact in day there is moon 😅😂
18163,bfThiqDd9FA,"To make it more realistic, O think the dust cloud should be smaller in size"
18164,bfThiqDd9FA,Hehe nice done
18165,bfThiqDd9FA,😁😁😁 THAT IS MOON FARTING 😝😝...
18166,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂tes un fou
18167,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
18168,bfThiqDd9FA,They nuked the moon..
18169,bfThiqDd9FA,4 march is my birthday
18170,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust is toooo fast bro just dont look right..
18171,bfThiqDd9FA,What kids see:
18172,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon had to let it rip
18173,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, the birds do the same sound all time!"
18174,bfThiqDd9FA,Why there's no lava?
18175,bfThiqDd9FA,That would have made a loud explosive gong heard on earth
18176,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not bad editing to be honest although something that size would cause quite a bit more destruction and the lack of atmosphere would mean no mushroom cloud, also the moon is a good 5x bigger than how it actually looks in the sky"
18177,bfThiqDd9FA,Dude! Try harder on the next one
18178,bfThiqDd9FA,The same day batman movie was out
18179,bfThiqDd9FA,Nasa shooting off 🚀 impacted into the 🌙
18180,bfThiqDd9FA,I 📞 NASA's
18181,bfThiqDd9FA,I use NASA's for the information
18182,bfThiqDd9FA,It was astriod impact

18188,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems legit.
18189,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
18190,bfThiqDd9FA,Scientist suck. I know Moon has a gravity
18191,bfThiqDd9FA,Goofy ahh video lmao💀💀
18192,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg what is 5hat what is 5hat
18193,bfThiqDd9FA,.... No hope for us
18194,bfThiqDd9FA,only in ohio💀
18195,bfThiqDd9FA,Shity
18196,bfThiqDd9FA,Hold up wait a minute is that a asteroid
18197,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon isn't physical at all. It's a hologram.
18198,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't see how our space junk could get so far out in space to come at the moon from outside its orbit
18199,bfThiqDd9FA,"Облака идут плавно, а дым тормозит, да и скорость слишком высокая на таком расстоянии, однозначно это монтаж."
18200,bfThiqDd9FA,How is fast?😮
18201,bfThiqDd9FA,"What happened to the moon on March 4, 2022?

A rocket part crashed on the moon, as predicted, at around 7:25 a.m. EST on March 4, 2022. It smashed into the far side of the moon — where lunar orbiters were not able to observe the event — in the Hertzsprung crater, which is 350 miles wide. Humans weren't able to observe it from Earth, but the collision created a plume of dust that possibly lingered for hours."
18202,bfThiqDd9FA,It was my birthday and I missed this 😱
18203,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nonsense, or the Moon ist not what they keep on telling us."
18204,bfThiqDd9FA,Bull shit
18205,bfThiqDd9FA,"I just think of the movie, the time machine! When he's going forward in time he stops and the moon is falling apart because of humans of course!"
18206,bfThiqDd9FA,A nuclear warhead wouldn't cause that big of a blast or as fast! Come on people. 😐
18207,bfThiqDd9FA,You couldn't at least match the frame rates? 😅
18208,bfThiqDd9FA,U fl odr u get dbl
18209,bfThiqDd9FA,I know some days we can still see the moon during the day. But  Why is the moon still so large and clearly  visible on a bright sunny day?
18210,bfThiqDd9FA,Cause the sun shines on the moon too so it's just as bright as anything else the sun is shining on
18211,bfThiqDd9FA,I heard that sound booom !!
18212,bfThiqDd9FA,Edited
18213,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try....i think 🤔 the edited software is trial version 😀  the stone disappeared when the cloud passing...next time try better 😀 😉 😜
18214,bfThiqDd9FA,SENTINEL!
18215,bfThiqDd9FA,This is evidence that the moon is a type of plasma. Does not explode like a bomb and does not catch fire
18216,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yea, the cloud just happened to be as big as Russia×³"
18217,bfThiqDd9FA,In a day how can you see the moon
18218,bfThiqDd9FA,"So many lies about the Moon, we know there is structures. You can see a bridge,tower and odd structures with a Nikon P900 from home. When they gonna come clean??"
18219,bfThiqDd9FA,It's one punchman😁
18220,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakr
18221,bfThiqDd9FA,Woah no way to be honest not even the most powerful nuke will be visible if detonated on the what make you think a rocket booster will
18222,bfThiqDd9FA,Its a raw video fools

18231,bfThiqDd9FA,nice FX ...
18232,bfThiqDd9FA,I’m not an expert on physics but I’m pretty sure that’s not how physics work..
18233,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that bugs bunny landing on the moon?
18234,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh yes the classic camera shake filter
18235,bfThiqDd9FA,this looks so stupid.
18236,bfThiqDd9FA,KA BOOOOOOOOM
18237,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how YT puts a little note down below the thumbnail that states: “people also watched this.” Whut? 😂😂
18238,bfThiqDd9FA,I think Hulk has landed over there
18239,bfThiqDd9FA,Mas verdadeiro que uma nota de 3 reais
18240,bfThiqDd9FA,The size of the plum doesn't match the perspective of the impact. You would NOT be able to see this from esrth
18241,bfThiqDd9FA,I would like to spend my time cleaning up space debris.
18242,bfThiqDd9FA,This is what a cartoon from another planet looks like
18243,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon is farting
18244,bfThiqDd9FA,"Esto es falso, muy falso🤨🤨"
18245,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a cloud.
18246,bfThiqDd9FA,“These effects aren’t very special” -Butthead
18247,bfThiqDd9FA,Ned atmosphere for mushroom cloud sucker!
18248,bfThiqDd9FA,"I had a dream similar to this but instead somebody shot a nuclear rocket at the Moon. The Moon broke and pieces crashed onto Earth. It was so vivid I litteraly felt the heat as each piece crash landed, I couldn't breathe with all the dust and fire."
18249,bfThiqDd9FA,RIP vector
18250,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hahaha,, even dust cloud movement caused by nuclear weapon explosions wasn't that fast. Good editing but lack of logic."
18251,bfThiqDd9FA,The one that was supposed to hit earth missed and hit the moon😲👍👌
18252,bfThiqDd9FA,You knew the crash was going to happen or what
18253,bfThiqDd9FA,That is the fakest shit ever!
18254,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow cool to know the moon has a ""atmosphere"""
18255,bfThiqDd9FA,Aliens can’t Fly
18256,bfThiqDd9FA,WTF !!!
18257,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon qweefed
18258,bfThiqDd9FA,Anyone buying this crap? 🤔
18259,bfThiqDd9FA,"If u live long enough, u c lot of it💩"
18260,bfThiqDd9FA,It took over 4 hours before the sound was detected.
18261,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama😵😵
18262,bfThiqDd9FA,It's finally happening. Saiyan pod has landed on the moon. Oshit!
18263,bfThiqDd9FA,Next time please consider the fact that this tiny cloud is partially transparent. You can see the thing coming behind the cloud as if it was a solid piece of wall or smthing. The thingy should have partially been seen behind the cloud.
18264,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is a 2D model painted on the firmament 👀
18265,bfThiqDd9FA,Uhhhhhhh🤔
18266,bfThiqDd9FA,Guys it was not missile... It was just goku and beerus fighting in space... Relax ...stay away from rumours
18267,bfThiqDd9FA,Hell yeah 👍🤘🤘
18268,bfThiqDd9FA,"Annndd you just happened to be filming the moon to catch it?! Annndd what is this you caught? A“moon fart”?!What did it do? Send you a text or something?!?!!
Moon: In T minus 2 seconds…🌖💨!
Dude, this stuff just cracks me up!!!🤣"
18269,bfThiqDd9FA,👽 trying to get away from 🌎
18270,bfThiqDd9FA,There is bo man made object that big to impact let alone the shape of dust cloud is wrong for space. Let alone size.
18271,bfThiqDd9FA,How did it hit the moon so fast
18272,bfThiqDd9FA,I lovw how the fog is lagginf
18273,bfThiqDd9FA,seems like saitama fought another strong opponent
18274,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks totally faked

1. It's morning, how is there moon in the morning?
2. The asteroid appears out from nowhere 💀"
18281,bfThiqDd9FA,This wasn't March 4th. It was March 5th I believe...
18282,bfThiqDd9FA,"OMG 😱  Hope every flag on the moon is ok! 
😁😉"
18283,bfThiqDd9FA,But why bro
18284,bfThiqDd9FA,They already knew that was going to happen..so keep the camera in
18285,bfThiqDd9FA,Its saitama
18286,bfThiqDd9FA,Putin : US attacs the moon. We must send peacetroops because its part of russian world.
18287,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow my first time seeing it that is very exciting but thank God and it hit the moon cuz it could hit Earth that would be a tragedy the person that caught it at the right a little see something like that
18288,bfThiqDd9FA,'M' as in walrus.
18289,bfThiqDd9FA,It farted
18290,bfThiqDd9FA,It's crazy that you got this on film. Nice one.
18291,bfThiqDd9FA,it’s the usa nuke on moon test.
18292,bfThiqDd9FA,Why did i never see this
18293,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂 very clever
18294,bfThiqDd9FA,I think that a astronaut has crash on moon
18295,bfThiqDd9FA,"239,000 thousand miles away...yeah right! How about 3600 miles away?"
18296,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket must have been enormous to make that explosion
18297,bfThiqDd9FA,Gotta love how that smoke cloud is almost the same size of Spain
18298,bfThiqDd9FA,It was WAY bigger than Spain if it was actually that size
18299,bfThiqDd9FA,Who was capturing before it hits?
18300,bfThiqDd9FA,It's almost like you have access to video editing software.. 🤣
18301,bfThiqDd9FA,Przecież to wszystko jest projekcją!
18302,bfThiqDd9FA,u can't see the moon from this planet like that
18303,bfThiqDd9FA,Are you new to Earth?
18304,bfThiqDd9FA,No
18305,bfThiqDd9FA,@@liam2795 Ever heard of a telescope?
18306,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice, except the plume of smoke disappeared way too soon."
18307,bfThiqDd9FA,Something as large as a city moving fractional lightspeed
18308,bfThiqDd9FA,"It looks like Wile E. Coyote fired an Acme rocket at the Road Runner, but missed and hit the moon instead."

18340,bfThiqDd9FA,"Huh, in Comparison to Moons dia the dust cloud is 1000s of kms high for sure, so the debris traveled that far in a fraction of a second nearly at light speed🤣🤣🤣"

18342,bfThiqDd9FA,Sure you did.
18343,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah right
18344,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket or meteor would have been 5000km big 😂
18345,bfThiqDd9FA,Iver never seen the moon that clear in the middle of the day
18346,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try mate
18347,bfThiqDd9FA,The noon is not a rock spinning in space. You've been lied to.

You watching Youtube again Son
Yeah
Ok son have fun."
18352,bfThiqDd9FA,You could see the asteroid glowing in the sunlight before hitting the moon. Typical indication of iron which is what an asteroid is made of and reflects sunlight really well. Its a rare occasion to capture a moon impact. Kudos to the cameraman. Hope he becomes rich👍
18353,bfThiqDd9FA,The Russians are just flexing out...

18359,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahaha what a fraud! Moon has no atmosphere to form a cloud
18360,bfThiqDd9FA,Shure the dust cloud shot out at least 1.000 miles in 1.5 seconds and he just happened to have a camera ready and we are supposed to believe that🤣😂😅

18367,bfThiqDd9FA,What if that was a crew on a ship that went haywire and they lost control and it's really a cover up..
18368,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon: Why u bully me
Asteroid: Cause you swallowed my friends"
18369,bfThiqDd9FA,If out of control rocket hit the moon it would send glaciers going Atlest 2509 miles and 238mph every where because it didn’t hit an angle
18370,bfThiqDd9FA,Impact explosion effect
18371,bfThiqDd9FA,"it's funny that you can see the dust, when the moon has no air.😆"
18372,bfThiqDd9FA,Lame attempt at BS
18373,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is how the U.S. 2020 election was...oh, never mind."
18374,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
18375,bfThiqDd9FA,o
18376,bfThiqDd9FA,just.....why?
18377,bfThiqDd9FA,WTF WE FOUND SAITAMA
18378,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing
18379,bfThiqDd9FA,It was saitama
18380,bfThiqDd9FA,This is one of the fakest videos I have ever seen
18381,bfThiqDd9FA,"Crater visual from Oregon, it was Huge!!! get your telescopes out and look"
18382,bfThiqDd9FA,"Cap cap cap cap cap cap

18383,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣 the editing is so bad lmao
18384,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aaaah!  My grandma can make better moon crash videos than this! Faster too! Plus... she's... well, you know... she's dead. 😁"
18385,bfThiqDd9FA,or another theory has anyone heard of clouds behind the moon its a flat eartb thing
18386,bfThiqDd9FA,Moonfall deleted scene 😂😂😂
18387,bfThiqDd9FA,Good work in adobe after effects
18388,bfThiqDd9FA,the smoke was recorded at 10 fps jajajaja
18389,bfThiqDd9FA,This clip made in China or what 🙄
18390,bfThiqDd9FA,Is what the moon is for to take impacts instead of the earth
18391,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, who would be there filming the moon for no reason?"
18392,bfThiqDd9FA,This really did happen I seen it on Google just now it sure did wonder why they didn't tell us about it
18393,bfThiqDd9FA,No Words To Say Just 😂😂😂
18394,bfThiqDd9FA,The impact cloud is like 1/10 the size of the entire moon and the object is like 1/100th of the size of the moon. Wouldn’t an impact that large cause noticeable damage to the moon?
18395,bfThiqDd9FA,Went strait thru.
18396,bfThiqDd9FA,No because the moon is made of green cheese which is quite forgiving.
18397,bfThiqDd9FA,I love cheese
18398,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm sorry. I think it's a very well done montage.....💨🔭😳
18399,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂
18400,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
18401,bfThiqDd9FA,BULLSHIT
18402,bfThiqDd9FA,You forgot to put a sound of nuclear bomb 😂😂
18403,bfThiqDd9FA,CLICK BAIT
18404,bfThiqDd9FA,you have no idea what you are doing..    this is incredible bullshit
18405,bfThiqDd9FA,"Did't now it was air i space, so the dust could form a cloud."
18406,bfThiqDd9FA,If that happend if it was a nuke by moon and we wouldn’t be living anymore
18407,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the creators think an actual impact creates an atomic mushroom cloud instead of an impact crater.
18408,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon looks so huge lmao
18409,bfThiqDd9FA,"My, how quickly the plume dissipates.

My, how steady the camera, though unsteady. 

Convincing😒"
18410,bfThiqDd9FA,"cant believe u wasted all that time typing that above nothing else to do aye
as someone here said the dust cloud is a diffrent speed to the main video pfffffff"
18411,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love this video, Amazing it was captured, Saw it on the news too."
18412,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope this is a joke
18413,bfThiqDd9FA,"We as a human being, have to start asking questions, to find the truth and get out of this illusion"
18414,bfThiqDd9FA,"In my opinion, and from my perspective the Veil is being lifted of Truth"
18415,bfThiqDd9FA,Its just the moon farted
18416,bfThiqDd9FA,Rubbish!
18417,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing how nobody else saw this.
18418,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn even the explosion is so seen and invisible from far away
18419,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fall gonna happen in 10 years
18420,bfThiqDd9FA,More lies
18421,bfThiqDd9FA,This is clearly BS. 1: anything that bright during the day would be hundreds of kilometers across and would be picked up and tracked by every astronomer and observatory weeks before it ever got close. And 2: impacts of that size do not happen that quickly. I know this because I am an astronomer and whoever concocted this rubbish is doing a major disservice to the public.
18422,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
18423,bfThiqDd9FA,Horseshit.
18424,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ilove Nasa, clear like ISS in space."
18425,bfThiqDd9FA,🤔🤔🤔
18426,bfThiqDd9FA,This guy hates the moon huh
18427,bfThiqDd9FA,There’s no atmosphere on the moon to make a mushroom cloud
18428,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ahhh, the framerate of the VFX doesn’t match the framerate of the video. Great video, i’m sure a lot of time was put into it 🤦🏻‍♂️"
18429,bfThiqDd9FA,Everyone run moon is crashing
18430,bfThiqDd9FA,How can “aliens” be so advanced when they’re constantly crashing shit everywhere? 🤦‍♀️
18431,bfThiqDd9FA,And it just magically dissipates in space for no reason
18432,bfThiqDd9FA,"One question for everyone, why does the booster rocket appear much to large when compared to the moon itself?"
18433,bfThiqDd9FA,You wouldn't see it in reality.
18434,bfThiqDd9FA,"This a  perpective thing. the booster is a little closer to the camera than moon is. happens all the time.

it the guy recording woybd have taken the time to take a step or too foward, then to his right i think things would ve looked more correctly. at least thats what a professhional would have do.
ne"
18435,bfThiqDd9FA,For starters you would not be able to see any rocket part or impact.  :))
18436,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
18437,bfThiqDd9FA,Чё за хрень
18438,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon would not shift that fast.
18439,bfThiqDd9FA,I saw something similar hit the sun the other day but I didn't think anyone would be interested
18440,bfThiqDd9FA,Would that even happen since the moon is only 1/6 of its gravity?
18441,bfThiqDd9FA,720p vs 450p 🤣🤣
18442,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ah yes, totally 100% completely true"
18443,bfThiqDd9FA,Guess the camera man is always ready n waiting as usual😐
18444,bfThiqDd9FA,I want my money back.
18445,bfThiqDd9FA,because there would be a mushroom cloud half the size of the moon magically teleporting the slightest bit back and forth
18446,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow,no one even cares if people died man, people..."
18447,bfThiqDd9FA,Trash
18448,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm filming the moon this afternoon
18449,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bang, and the dirt is gone"
18450,bfThiqDd9FA,That bluebeam project is doin his job
18451,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought that myself....
18452,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon out in the day
18453,bfThiqDd9FA,Cos it fancied some fresh air....
18454,bfThiqDd9FA,@@SPIKE0-0-0 wanted to go for a walk
18455,bfThiqDd9FA,@@fkez0510 🤣👍🏼....
18456,bfThiqDd9FA,You got to be stupid if you think the moon is that far.
18457,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how the frame rate of the explosion doesn't match the rest of the video. Science sure is weird.
18458,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust dissappear so fast after the crash!
18459,bfThiqDd9FA,"If anyone of you really want Truth you have to search for it, advice dont go to church,  they have some of the truth,  but half the truth is still a lie 💯📖 facts are that the Torah is part of the new covenant, look up Jeremiah 31:33 in the Hebrew,  book of Hebrews quotes that very scripture,  Messiah himself said heaven and earth would pass before anything perished from the Torah Mathew 5:17-20, Messiah kept the Torah perfectly and said follow Me i have laid before you the perfect example, sadly people want to take away from the Father's perfect Torah,  dont fall for it, NO ONE has the authority to do so , not even the Son that's why he said I do nothing of myself, of course we don't keep the Torah to earn salvation,  it is the Father's instructions and will for our lives, we can only be justified through the Blood of Messiah Yeshua , but do we continue in sin that grace may abound  GOD FORBID Romans 6:1-2, do we make void the Torah through faith GOD FORBID we ESTABLISH the Torah Romans 3:31, the whole point of the Torah is to point out sin, if you get rid of it we no longer are aware of these sins the Torah points out, may YAH bless you all 🙏💯♥️☝️📖"
18460,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon so big
18461,bfThiqDd9FA,"PRANK ! there is literally no way you Could see that = LITERALLY !!! you Do Realize this = RIGHT ? And Left The reel in Tact ? 😆 youtube couldn`t be more on timing to take every last bit of thought out of rendered videos ,

18464,bfThiqDd9FA,This video looks like they cropped Steve'os powder fart of jackass movie
18465,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg I hope the man in the moon didn't get hurt.
18466,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon smoking that Elizabeth pack too
18467,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's just Saitama.

There are so many problems with this I don't even know where to start. Something that big moving at near relativistic speeds. The earth will be peppered with debris."
18468,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon is awesome that Earth Has. Our Earth it blasts  clouds into space too . Volcanos. !! Cool video of our moon .
18469,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how nobody pointed out the fact that the full moon is visible during broad daylight
18470,bfThiqDd9FA,"1. That's not a full noon
2. The moon can be seen during daytime"
18471,bfThiqDd9FA,An average person's butt after taco bell
18472,bfThiqDd9FA,Big hit there
18473,bfThiqDd9FA,It wasn't an accident. They are blowing up bases on the moon
18474,bfThiqDd9FA,🤦🏼‍♂️
18475,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow! That's amazing, a giant man-made rocket exploded on the moon, and it was visible from Earth! Wow"
18476,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope you are trolling
18477,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty sure a dust cloud on the moon wouldn’t rise like one on the earth since there’s no air on the moon
18478,bfThiqDd9FA,"Finally American did their dream project...to nuke the moon...

 Well done lads"
18479,bfThiqDd9FA,😂🤏🏾

18488,bfThiqDd9FA,Feak!!!!!🤬
18489,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
18490,bfThiqDd9FA,👏🏼
18491,bfThiqDd9FA,That would literally crack the moon in half if not completely destroy it
18492,bfThiqDd9FA,This is the fakest shit I've ever seen in my life!
18493,bfThiqDd9FA,Woooosh
18494,bfThiqDd9FA,2 days earlier it was a new moon?  How could this be?
18495,bfThiqDd9FA,"Are we supposed to believe it is possible to see a spent rocket with the naked eye at 240,000 miles away???? Cmon man…."
18496,bfThiqDd9FA,"""A rocket part that's been careering around space for years is set to collide with the moon on Friday, and it will be the first time a chunk of space junk has unintentionally slammed into the lunar surface.""

The rocket's career came to an abrupt halt."
18497,bfThiqDd9FA,"Can't fool me, the Moon is flat!
Good try though. 👍🏻"
18498,bfThiqDd9FA,More 'SHITE IN SPACCCCCCCEEEEE'.
18499,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love the crap you can do with a cheap phone and some freeware editing software ... looks great,  saw another one somewhere with a visible shockwave in space and sound!!!"
18500,bfThiqDd9FA,And the moon is flat just like the earth
18501,bfThiqDd9FA,🙉🤣
18502,bfThiqDd9FA,Hold on are we sure we can’t just catch a flight up there
18503,bfThiqDd9FA,anyone else see a mushroom cloud
18504,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is made of cheese
18505,bfThiqDd9FA,I doubt anybody could stay quiet for that shot. That would be a possible end of humanity impact. Chunks of the Moon would have peppered the Earth.
18506,bfThiqDd9FA,"NASA named the collision as "" MOON FART """
18507,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahhaha
18508,bfThiqDd9FA,And his vfx only lasted for 0:43 ...
18509,bfThiqDd9FA,Y?
18510,bfThiqDd9FA,Vat da Faak!
18511,bfThiqDd9FA,good PS
18512,bfThiqDd9FA,Many men mock the moon.
18513,bfThiqDd9FA,It let out a fart
18514,bfThiqDd9FA,That's no rocket
18515,bfThiqDd9FA,Not the best animation I've seen
18516,bfThiqDd9FA,"ah yes, ""out of control rocket"" going like 5% the speed of light"
18517,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aaahhh, Saitama!"
18518,bfThiqDd9FA,moonfart
18519,bfThiqDd9FA,That would be like tzar bomb
18520,bfThiqDd9FA,So a dust cloud on earth doesn't rise that fast but you will see it rise on the moon in under 2 seconds from earth ? Ever seen a volcano on earth ??????? Embarrassing
18521,bfThiqDd9FA,"How in the hell did we see a rocket damn near 240, 000 miles away, People in California should be able to see a rocket take off in florida"
18522,bfThiqDd9FA,A rocket
18523,bfThiqDd9FA,The direction size and speed of the explosion is too fast nice work though
18524,bfThiqDd9FA,Goofy. The speed of the ploom would seem to take forever if it was to be believable
18525,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
18526,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just farted
18527,bfThiqDd9FA,Soon after that u.ll see another explosion 💥 when saitama jump back to boros
18528,bfThiqDd9FA,Why moon isn't moving? Maybe stuck?
18529,bfThiqDd9FA,Must work for nasa🐍
18530,bfThiqDd9FA,Try adobe softwares
18531,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, right, just imagine."
18532,bfThiqDd9FA,Very nice special effects...!!!
18533,bfThiqDd9FA,There is only a vacuum in space. The so called moon crash isn't possible.
18534,bfThiqDd9FA,When animator has no clue of physics.
18535,bfThiqDd9FA,Was their a nuke on that giant rocket?
18536,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏

18540,bfThiqDd9FA,"And on that day the skies turned black  and it rained mud and 90 percent of all life on earth died...

That was really cool video editing. It would be epic if talent like your could mingle with the HFY community."
18541,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think NASA might have mentioned this , don't you ?"
18542,bfThiqDd9FA,Woooosh
18543,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farts in 240p

18548,bfThiqDd9FA,If it’s I’m the vacuum of space why did the dust cloud stop moving 🤷‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
18549,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks so cool but I can't believe its clickbate. Because mushroom clouds can't happen in space :(
18550,bfThiqDd9FA,And what's the reason for the Artemus rocket to go to the moon?

18556,bfThiqDd9FA,"Would that be a cheese mushroom cloud?
Asking for a friend."
18557,bfThiqDd9FA,Not how impact debris would act in such thin atmosphere.
18558,bfThiqDd9FA,stop motion being like

18570,bfThiqDd9FA,Your movie maker software has an update. Please download now
18571,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is not that far away from us. Scientist calculations are not correct.
18572,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how in space a dust cloud has like 15fps
18573,bfThiqDd9FA,"The smoke/cloud popped immediately after hitting that object? 
That dust In less than a second and hundreds/thousands of KMs like speed of light?
Cloud popped thousands of KMs even faster or same as speed of object?
Is there anything you wanna explain about to make us believe this video is true?"
18574,bfThiqDd9FA,Computerised
18575,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mushroom cloud? Nice touch. 
To have a mushroom cloud post impact - in the vacuum of space... impressive."
18576,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama

18604,bfThiqDd9FA,I remember seeing this happen it was amazing
18605,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
18606,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice animation
18607,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon cannot be larger than 70 miles in diameter because that is how wide it’s shadow is during an eclipse.
18608,bfThiqDd9FA,"That would assume the sun is the same size as the moon, it's not, it's insanely large so the shadow is cone shaped. The moon is over 2000 miles in diameter."
18609,bfThiqDd9FA,The impact was so strong that the reality just propped some frames.
18610,bfThiqDd9FA,Mother nature needs a better GPU
18611,bfThiqDd9FA,nice stock explosion.
18612,bfThiqDd9FA,A megarocket the size of Belgium...
18613,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems legit. Could be military or a government sending bombs to the moon to see its effects .
18614,bfThiqDd9FA,"Faudrait dire a Elon Musk qu’il vient de perdre une couple de raptor.. 

We must tell Elon Musk that he had lost a few Raptors on the moon …without the boosters I hope"
18615,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely done
18616,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the moon is just bright in the sky at like 9am
18617,bfThiqDd9FA,I mean... it's like that every month near the full moon phase.
18618,bfThiqDd9FA,😂👍

18628,bfThiqDd9FA,someone wanting to share their vfx learning progress with us
18629,bfThiqDd9FA,"B for effort, c- for performance."
18630,bfThiqDd9FA,Why..?
18631,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is not a solid object so this is impossible.
18632,bfThiqDd9FA,Nearly good attempt tho
18633,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
18634,bfThiqDd9FA,wow this looks so realistic
18635,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust wouldnt be so visible
18636,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow incredibile  è un vero impatto  mandatelo a history canel !! Sento già  un documentario sul fatto
18637,bfThiqDd9FA,so the moon is already inside the earth's atmosphere?
18638,bfThiqDd9FA,1 and a billion chans of happining
18639,bfThiqDd9FA,It would not do that
18640,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is very educational
It should be on every media network
And in schools
Our kids need to know how many stupid people we have on our plannet"
18641,bfThiqDd9FA,I pray that this comment is satirical.
18642,bfThiqDd9FA,@@nikkiwilliams967I pray you are joking. THEY LITERALLY SAID AFTER THAT THAT THERE ARE MANY STUPID PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET.
18643,bfThiqDd9FA,Testing nukes on moon . We are  screwed
18644,bfThiqDd9FA,"They have to destroy the moon bases before civilians start traveling to the moon, otherwise they’d know the truth."
18645,bfThiqDd9FA,Only on the internet hehehe
18646,bfThiqDd9FA,"Absolutely disgusting, the audacity of man 🙄"
18647,bfThiqDd9FA,LOLOL 😂😂😂
18648,bfThiqDd9FA,Reyl😮👍
18649,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like a tip of a cloud passing in front of the moon.
18650,bfThiqDd9FA,It farted
18651,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool effects 😎 👌
18652,bfThiqDd9FA,You are talented
18653,bfThiqDd9FA,"Man i was layin out in pool smokin a dub when this happened, you could even hear it too, i bet them aliens that live up there to spy on us are fuckin pissed. Prob damaged alot of their hi tech equipment."
18654,bfThiqDd9FA,What dumb shit is this.
18655,bfThiqDd9FA,That's some funny SHIT right there
18656,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
18657,bfThiqDd9FA,Чтоооо 🤣🤣🤣🤣
18658,bfThiqDd9FA,But it would not make the moon move on impact
18659,bfThiqDd9FA,"cute chifchaf bird sounds in the background, and the smoke from the crash shaped like a heart :)"
18660,bfThiqDd9FA,What
18661,bfThiqDd9FA,Lovely graphics.. Looks like moon was Nuked!
18662,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like video game ps2 graphics
18663,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farts.. got it 👍
18664,bfThiqDd9FA,Kinda looks like the moon is vaping
18665,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just Farted 💨
18666,bfThiqDd9FA,lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
18667,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
18668,bfThiqDd9FA,Why moon is moving
18669,bfThiqDd9FA,At least try to get the FPS correct when making these. Also something that large travelling that fast would cause a lot more damage than that. Also note that the dust cloud is being held in shape by air pressure and gravity. On the moon.
18670,bfThiqDd9FA,If this would have been true then then the speed of the object crashing would be definitely in some millions of kms per hour
18671,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud went way to high to fast. Its always the little things.
18672,bfThiqDd9FA,How have a moon on day
18673,bfThiqDd9FA,"Funny because a ""cloud"" wouldn't billow out like a mushroom in space......"
18674,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool effect. Now throw one at the haters
18675,bfThiqDd9FA,I believe this more than the moon landing
18676,bfThiqDd9FA,The angle I recorded was better. I was on the other side
18677,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit ever
18678,bfThiqDd9FA,Any how it's reached up to 2.8M .
18679,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

18683,bfThiqDd9FA,Threy knew it was to happen.
18684,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the Queen’s head like on a stamp moving towards the moon and then Head in the moon like a football
18685,bfThiqDd9FA,Sehr schlecht gemacht.
18686,bfThiqDd9FA,its edited😂😂😂😂
18687,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that moon just farted!?
18688,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how…..
18689,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty bad editing

18695,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact was instant as if it was on my backyard.
18696,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon is Crashed a rocket hitting the Moon 😂😂
18697,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is so close you can almost touch it!  No more than 50 miles high!
18698,bfThiqDd9FA,"This size of a star with the right distance close to the moon, it might be few hundred times bigger then the moon and it can destroy the whole moon🙃"
18699,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit
18700,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn when did the moon get 100x closer woww so legit bro 😱🤯🤯
18701,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing how cynical ppl are. Our governments have done a number on our psyche. We think everything is a deception.
18702,bfThiqDd9FA,That's insane... wonder what that was
18703,bfThiqDd9FA,Think about it people. If you can't see over half the planes in the sky and the ones you do don't move that fast then the answer is obvious.
18704,bfThiqDd9FA,Disneyland
18705,bfThiqDd9FA,badass maybe next time they can destroy the moon for good
18706,bfThiqDd9FA,"That crash was bigger than the Chicxulub. Good thing it somehow hit the face of the moon, that would have been the 6th mass extinction. 💨"
18707,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny how that person just happened to be there at the right time.
18708,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
18709,bfThiqDd9FA,what is this shiet?

18713,bfThiqDd9FA,Pura Animação Gráfica 😂😂😂 e ainda tem idiotas crendo que é verdade e discutindo sobre a gravidade da lua e de como a poeira na explosão do vídeo se formou era prova da gravidade na lua 😂😂😂😂😂😂 gente o vídeo é falso kkkkkkkkkk
18714,bfThiqDd9FA,There would be no dust cloud in space. The debris would move out in straight lines.
18715,bfThiqDd9FA,Más trucho que la idea socialista

18720,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit.
18721,bfThiqDd9FA,That is unreal because the moon is to far away from us @#$&# and is not going so fast like that
18722,bfThiqDd9FA,Cheese everywhere
18723,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is never that big man 🙂
18724,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
18725,bfThiqDd9FA,bruh the dust cloud has like 10 fps and the moon is 3x closer to earth
18726,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
18727,bfThiqDd9FA,че хуйню несете ?Невидите луна пернула
18728,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like big tree on top of the moon
18729,bfThiqDd9FA,This time sound travelled through space😂
18730,bfThiqDd9FA,It hit the wrong planet 🤣
18731,bfThiqDd9FA,Putin ???

18734,bfThiqDd9FA,OK...
18735,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you understand how fast that object would be moving? Comets aren't observed moving even close to that...
18736,bfThiqDd9FA,Beautiful Editing

18742,bfThiqDd9FA,How come the moon is that clode on earth you lier🤨🤔🤥
18743,bfThiqDd9FA,Those crazy aliens!!!
18744,bfThiqDd9FA,😒😒😒😒
18745,bfThiqDd9FA,Well that was a nuke on the moon and is that how there’s holes in the moon???
18746,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hahaha what a bullshit.
Judging by the size of the moon the approach speed has to be a few hundred of km/s;) The cloud propagation similar. 
But what a beautiful cloud! That cloud even has a convection movement, in the vacuum!!!"
18747,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is not that big well it's far from earth
18748,bfThiqDd9FA,We all know it’s made out of plasma

18756,bfThiqDd9FA,"And here you have it folks, the newly created smoke poof emoji. 💨"
18757,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂According to video the satellite is the size of a country and what is it doing on the moon which is at a very long distance 😂😂and seeing at daylight that clear
18758,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon diameter = 3,474.8 kms ~ 3500 kms.
Meteorite or missile whatever travels at the speed of 1 moon diameter per 7 seconds approx.
Which means 500 kms/sec   -> 1,800,000 kms/hour

Missile speed ~ 24,000 kms/hour
Meteorite speed ~ 252,000 kms/hour.

This edit looks realistic. but mathematically not realistic. Sorry video editors, I can't convince my mind unless I play in slow motion."
18759,bfThiqDd9FA,Edit?
18760,bfThiqDd9FA,You fakers forgot the Moon is made out from cheese!
18761,bfThiqDd9FA,It's not a rocket but a UFO crashed on a moon!
18762,bfThiqDd9FA,That looks like an fx gif out of Duke nuken 3d 🤣
18763,bfThiqDd9FA,Nukem*
18764,bfThiqDd9FA,🥱
18765,bfThiqDd9FA,"That meteor must have been huge, being visible from earth during the daylight. And those physics of the cloud, its almost as if it happened in air. Astonishing!!"
18766,bfThiqDd9FA,"And dont meteors need an atmosphere to get hot, and thus emit light, in?"
18767,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is small and near.
18768,bfThiqDd9FA,Hollow
18769,bfThiqDd9FA,ou alors que la lune est petite et proche  ;)
18770,bfThiqDd9FA,@@augusonictheracoon5279 The Moon is not that near as you think buddy. You can fit 30 entire Earths in between us.
18771,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow watch closely as the object first appearance the cloud looks like the face of a man who spit out something
18772,bfThiqDd9FA,"That explosion to be visible  at 222,000 miles away @ 10x magnification must have been huge !
Did China hit something that exploded adding to the bast ?
Imagine how huge to be 2% the circumference of the moon itself going up 300 miles or more 
WTF is going on ?"
18773,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mushroom cloud angle is all wrong, the object comes in from far and hits the moon at an angle but the mushroom cloud spreads dead 90 degrees horizontally. It should be going up away from the viewer slightly. Good try though"
18774,bfThiqDd9FA,i remember when this was all over the news
18775,bfThiqDd9FA,clickbait
18776,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like moon farted.💨
18777,bfThiqDd9FA,it is edited
18778,bfThiqDd9FA,mommy the moon farts.
18779,bfThiqDd9FA,Kkkkkkkk mais falso que uma nota de 3 reais rsrs

18783,bfThiqDd9FA,anyone believes in aliens really exists?
18784,bfThiqDd9FA,Why would the dust cloud act like it was not in a vacuum?
18785,bfThiqDd9FA,You think I am stupid to trust this?
18786,bfThiqDd9FA,"I wish our planets and moons were closer to be able to see them during day would be so cool. I imagine gravity would be funky tho.
Imagine if our atmosphere acted as a glass lens and zoomed in on objects when they went past. Oh wait the sun would cook us... 
man I’m so glad I can see our moon and it’s not farther away or smaller than it is."
18787,bfThiqDd9FA,И ни одного комента на русском бл
18788,bfThiqDd9FA,Super FAKR
18789,bfThiqDd9FA,i think .......Moon farted
18790,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn iPhones camera zoom got people seeing shit only Clark Kent should be able to see …….good thing he wasn’t recording from his windows 🪟
18791,bfThiqDd9FA,"That rock travel within seconds, 3 times the distances of the moon's radius. Too fast for the eye to see. Not possible."
18792,bfThiqDd9FA,As if you 'just happened' to have been filming before it happened. Right. Sure.
18793,bfThiqDd9FA,cmon its just saitama beating garou
18794,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how it hits just on the back side of the moon but the dust cloud goes up in a 90 degree as if it hit what I would call the edge of the moon from this pov... Thank for sharing this extraordinary footage with us...May you be so lucky to keep being the one to expose us to many more of these...
18795,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf
18796,bfThiqDd9FA,I will admit it's kinda strange we only see one side of the moon considering Earth's gravitational pull
18797,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's very simple. As the moon's core cooled, the Earth's gravity pulled the magma in the core towards it, meaning the hemisphere that faces us is more dense than the farther half. Therefore the moon is ""geolocked"" with one side always facing Earth's gravity."
18798,bfThiqDd9FA,@@CanadaMatt why wouldn't that cause the moon to move towards earth when struck by meteors on the less dense side.....it's a question
18799,bfThiqDd9FA,There’s goes Elon
18800,bfThiqDd9FA,"Seeing the moon in the daytime is never not interesting, but someone was just recording the moon, as if waiting for this to happen?"
18801,bfThiqDd9FA,"i know, sentinel prime has come"
18802,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how they just happen to be filming before it happens
18803,bfThiqDd9FA,The rendering images during the impact could have been better.
18804,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahhh. I too like to film the moon during the day 24/7 for literally no reason.

18811,bfThiqDd9FA,When was this happened? Wow!! Amazing
18812,bfThiqDd9FA,CRAP..   should be banned
18813,bfThiqDd9FA,Ha ha what an Environmental Animation from the point of Human Vision+ Position of Moon in Eyes+ Mental Imagery mechine work wright. Drawing in environment I made also so many made from a secret place. Also possible to be done by animation.
18814,bfThiqDd9FA,There'd be a tremendous flash of light first... and no mushroom clouds either since there is no air and without air there's no variation in pressures that contribute to the formation of a mushroom cloud.
18815,bfThiqDd9FA,Okay lets just explain  everything  wrong   here. First  off.  the size of  the moon is ridiculous. The  speed  of the asteroid  is even more ridiculous and  the fact that you can see it. The thing  is I am pretty sure  light  doesn't  go from moon to earth  in an instant. Moon doesn't  have strong enough atmosphere  for the mushroom cloud. Instead  it would have been round shaped  explosion of dust. And explosion  itself  was too fast. In summary If this object hit moon at this speed  I am not sure  if moon would even be still there...
18816,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
18817,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice job having your phone ready and watching the moon, you’re very lucky to have that happened exactly when you were looking 😂👏👏"
18818,bfThiqDd9FA,a mushroom cloud with no atmosphere wth
18819,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
18820,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
18821,bfThiqDd9FA,Big moon in your country but in my nope it not even view able
18822,bfThiqDd9FA,"Mistakes in this video
1. The moon is bigger/closer than usual

2. If the size of the spacecraft is such that you can see it from here, then the aliens will be considered giants

3. Such a bomb can destroy two entire continents or even three continents 

4. It's a filter"

You don’t even see planes moving that fast in the sky and we’re supposed to be able to see this object clearly and it’s impact into the moon at that distance moving at that speed? Maybe, but can someone explain why we don’t see objects moving this fast in space? … or, if we do."
18830,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg the moon is so big. And it looks like a little Tornado
18831,bfThiqDd9FA,Good vfx but lacks knowledge of basic science and dimensions.

18860,bfThiqDd9FA,well we planning on going back there better to hit first the aliens that have stopped us the past years
18861,bfThiqDd9FA,This could have been much more believable if the object hitting it wasn’t moving so fast and it the cloud didn’t rise from the surface so fast. Overkill all around. Subtlety is much more believable.
18862,bfThiqDd9FA,Uhh the moon doesn't really have an atmosphere yet there was a mushroom cloud?
18863,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool. The air was let out of the moon. Or it tooted. 😂

18888,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny how I'm just now hearing about this but somehow the entire world missed this happening that day. We would have been stopped by the loudest thunder clap we've ever heard and every working ear on the planet would have heard it
18889,bfThiqDd9FA,WTF GOING ON IN VERMONT?! 💀💀💀
18890,bfThiqDd9FA,What was the speed of that explosion
18891,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
18892,bfThiqDd9FA,wtf
18893,bfThiqDd9FA,"Photoshop 100%, since when u Can see the Moon like this at day"
18894,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you look carefully the moon actually moved back due to the ”impact""😁😁😁🙏"
18895,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow.
18896,bfThiqDd9FA,Montage
18897,bfThiqDd9FA,a dangerous experiment on a long run...inviting a sure disaster... 🤞
18898,bfThiqDd9FA,No air = no mushroom
18899,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
18900,bfThiqDd9FA,Why so many time wasters in this world?
18901,bfThiqDd9FA,MÁS FALSO NO PUEDE SER🤣🤣🤣🤣
18902,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn near expecting to hear the explosion
18903,bfThiqDd9FA,Poor little Einstein's
18904,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is it morning or light out with the moon out
18905,bfThiqDd9FA,So amazing that people are so stupid.  Explains why Biden got elected.
18906,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bullshit
18907,bfThiqDd9FA,"LOLOL I love this! Great job! Enjoyed the comments, too!"
18908,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farts 🤣

18911,bfThiqDd9FA,xDDDDDDDDDDD wtf is this
18912,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess santa has been drinking on the job.
18913,bfThiqDd9FA,LMFAO
18914,bfThiqDd9FA,Only thing faker that the dust plume is the bright object totally disappearing behind the  very thin cloud.
18915,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon lagging caught in 4k
18916,bfThiqDd9FA,Subpar editing at most.
18917,bfThiqDd9FA,"to get a cloud that big, you would have to hit it with a giant h bomb and it wouldn't look like that."
18918,bfThiqDd9FA,Werid that you can hear the impact.
18919,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂 its 2022 anything is possible
18920,bfThiqDd9FA,🌝💨  “whoops”
18921,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow!!
18922,bfThiqDd9FA,Wile E Coyote in another ACME inspired attempt to catch that tricky Roadrunner gone wrong. Again.
18923,bfThiqDd9FA,mans even has chapters to the video... come on man
18924,bfThiqDd9FA,I saw it too 🤷🏻‍♂️
18925,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon did fart
18926,bfThiqDd9FA,its in the news
18927,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao every scientist could figure this out in 2 seconds
18928,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice work but still need to learn in that process
18929,bfThiqDd9FA,That must have been one massive rocket just to be seen with the naked eye from earth.
18930,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow... someone is showing off their C-minus 9th grade motion graphics project.  At least you're close to the (cough) realism of the destructive force of the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator.
18931,bfThiqDd9FA,"17k likes and 59k DISLIKES. 
ENOUGH to prove"
18932,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool edit
18933,bfThiqDd9FA,thisnlooks like saitama jumping the moon to earth
18934,bfThiqDd9FA,I thought this was just a cool effect/visual they wanted to make but people really trying to defend it
18935,bfThiqDd9FA,We nuked the moon.
18936,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks cool but the moons surface wouldnt have a mushroom cloud on it because space debris collided with it
18937,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cloud rose before object hit.
18938,bfThiqDd9FA,Still looks cool
18939,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket/meteor would’ve had to been a lot bigger then massive time make that big of an explosion on the moon
18940,bfThiqDd9FA,Ja kann ich dir auch mit Aftereffects rein machen
18941,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao is the slow fps from a warp in time and space or just your computer? Hahaha
18942,bfThiqDd9FA,the audacity
18943,bfThiqDd9FA,This was hilarious!!! 😅😅😅😅😅
18944,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how the shape of the moon is a waxing gibbous whereas on March 4th, 2022, the moon was a waxing crescent."
18945,bfThiqDd9FA,Saw it from my house was crazy
18946,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the dust cloud rises up so fast. Even a nuke doesn't mushroom at that speed from this distance.
18947,bfThiqDd9FA,U know how mushrum forms on erth. But diferent atmosfere on the moon also gravity.
18948,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@boratesic5941 atmosphere on the moon, gravity 🤣🤦‍♂️ globers"
18949,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 moon has no atmosphere
18950,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@boratesic5941 this is actually correct. Since there is no atmosphere, the dust cloud wouldn’t form a mushroom at all."
18951,bfThiqDd9FA,@@pandorasactor7127 the moon is actually in a region of earths atmosphere called the geocorona. This stretches well past the moon and forms part of earths atmosphere as the outer layer that protect us against solar flares etc.
18952,bfThiqDd9FA,@@douglonmaduna7270 It is technically sometimes inside Earth's atmosphere (exosphere) but obviously the density is completely negligible.
18953,bfThiqDd9FA,Rocket was travelling near the speed of light hence the quick plume. Insane Video and how the chap captured to. I actually had moon dust land on my car a couple of days after this happened
18954,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Georgeconna32 You do realise this is a computer animation right?
18955,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Georgeconna32 LOLOLOL near the speed of light?? I hope your joking, no rocket has EVER gotten even close to the speed of light...."
18956,bfThiqDd9FA,And you draw this conclusion based on your decades worth of watching nuclear explosion mushroom clouds rise on planet Earth?
18957,bfThiqDd9FA,@@jakefink680 just like you draw every conclusion in and for your entire existence. Go pick a fight elsewhere buddy.
18958,bfThiqDd9FA,@@tonywells6990 I think he’s being sarcastic
18959,bfThiqDd9FA,@@OXIR Most likely 🤣
18960,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Shendrift Yeah why on moon is the dust descending into a mushroom cloud like that? Gravity is allegedly so low on the moon that the dust would be free to displace much more erratically, and less constrained, than the shape of a clear mushroom shape."
18961,bfThiqDd9FA,I was about to say that the same thing 😂
18962,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Georgeconna32 and for us to see that big thing hit really?? How do you calculate that speed? I'm sure your years at MIT can explain it. No moon dust hit your car. But I like how you got people to reply
18963,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@douglonmaduna7270 there are very minimal gases in the outermost fields, and it is not that which protects us from the sun and its radiation but it is the electromagnetic field produced by the earth"
18964,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 There's always one guy that stretches to explain how the ridiculous looking thing is actually correct.
18965,bfThiqDd9FA,"Somebody clearly doesn’t understand that there are no convection lines on the moon, because there isn’t any air pressure due to the lack of an atmosphere and magnetic field.

Also if such a large object collided with the moon at that speed, the moon would be a lava world."
18966,bfThiqDd9FA,@@theakiwar9118 So basically it wouldn't mushroom at that speed.
18967,bfThiqDd9FA,@@tonywells6990 lmao bro forgot what sarcasm was
18968,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sebastianusami lmao r/woosh
18969,bfThiqDd9FA,"Exactly.. If you consider the diameter of the moon, the cloud traveled about 500mi in one second.😂😂 even with no atmosphere and little gravity that is ridiculous."
18970,bfThiqDd9FA,UNDERSTAND!!!!!! The moon HAS an atmosphere!!!!!!
18971,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@GilbertGarcia_ojoartstudios no shit Sherlock a nuke is a complex chain reaction, of course the air pressure and earth debris will take longer to form a mushroom cloud"
18972,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 r/youngpeopleyoutube
18973,bfThiqDd9FA,@@sebastianusami that thing is traveling FAR faster than the speed of a rocket.
18974,bfThiqDd9FA,@@themagicminstrels476 never said it wasnt
18975,bfThiqDd9FA,"No the dust cloud is consistent with the math. Eyeballing that thing it'd be somewhere in the vicinity of 170ish km/s (1/20th moon diameter in one second). As theres no atmosphere, there isn't any drag to slow it down so things are just gonna go flying."
18976,bfThiqDd9FA,How many times have you been nuked?
18977,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@stolearovigor281 genuine question here for yourself, why don't you or the flat earth community build a rocket that can take a camera up to space ( without fish eye lens ) and see for yourself if it's really flat or not?"
18978,bfThiqDd9FA,You’re exactly right
18979,bfThiqDd9FA,A nuke isn't going to mushroom on the moon either.
18980,bfThiqDd9FA,In space it wouldn't even mushroom because there's no atmosphere.
18981,bfThiqDd9FA,More proof that the moon isn’t as far away as we’re told. But no one wants to believe it
18982,bfThiqDd9FA,Gilbert is in love everyone 💕 ❤ congratulations Gilbert 👏 for coming out
18983,bfThiqDd9FA,@@boratesic5941 moon is vaccume
18984,bfThiqDd9FA,Who said it was a nuke and the moon is isnt in our atmosphere dummmmm assssssss
18985,bfThiqDd9FA,@@douglonmaduna7270 Barely. Its on the cusp so to expect the impact to be the same as on earth isn't realistic
18986,bfThiqDd9FA,Well genius. Comets and Asteroids move much faster than any nuke.
18987,bfThiqDd9FA,Because it’s on the moon
18988,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@boratesic5941 the moon aint got no atmosphere, do your research properly before trying to correct someone"
18989,bfThiqDd9FA,yeah but the video is 40 seconds long so.....
18990,bfThiqDd9FA,the moons gravity and magnetic forces would probably have the effect of 'mushrooming' the particles. but it just seems to happen so fast. but if it did happen that fast then alot of energy would release that amount of surface material. at an angle that material would get ejected so high and with such velocity some would start to possibly orbit the moon for a while. possibly creating a temportary ring of ejecta around the moon
18991,bfThiqDd9FA,So much dum in these comments.
18992,bfThiqDd9FA,@@IK-ld8cw Not enough to cause a mushroom cloud
18993,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tommy-pz2yc They have and they used the results to confirm their theory XD
18994,bfThiqDd9FA,I think my favorite is the chirping birds.
18995,bfThiqDd9FA,Ohhh! The aliens on moon have died after this collision 😁😁
18996,bfThiqDd9FA,"When you watch point light satellites circling the earth at night then look at this one crashing into the moon, it must have been some big arsed rocket. Way, way, way bigger than the one Elon is trying to build."

19022,bfThiqDd9FA,Love it. If only 🤣
19023,bfThiqDd9FA,What app did u used.
19024,bfThiqDd9FA,Ugh if people could stop with uploading fakes on youtube... This is  partly why there are so many complotists todau
19025,bfThiqDd9FA,Why do we see blue sky behind the moon of the moon is out in space? it’s all lies
19026,bfThiqDd9FA,the sky is blue is because of the light being scattered by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere.
19027,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
19028,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks..Hollywood is waiting for you.

19037,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart🌕💨
19038,bfThiqDd9FA,Notice how there is a mushroom cloud even though the moon has nothing of gravity and atmosphere to create such shape
19039,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow! That mushroom cloud flew out around the speed of light. The object was that fast too.
19040,bfThiqDd9FA,trash

When somebody ask a question you get scumbag answers like this. A future full of shitheads who think they are smart because they were schooled by corrupt system. What if i said what you have learned is what they want you too hear and only few will be taught the truth to work the system. The ignorance of life today dont deserve a future, people arecstruggling and in need and you have shitheads like this ridiculing and mocking people. I hope the world does end i may not have good schooling but im a bright mind and been waking folk up for alongtime and dont need phd's, A levels or any other puece of paper to say im clever. This planet deserves to perish, not one of these smart so called individuals as stated we can survive and here is how, well let me say this. This earth can survive and all it takes is a Nuclear Fission amnesty and a pact to send all global nukes towards threats outside of this world informs of rock to prevent any collision today or in the future. Oh and before one says they wont make it due to rocket fuel burnout, well thats not true as devices can be designed today, that have your rocket guided by a fan system and that create enough turbulence to propell without fuel in airless atmosphere meaning it no doubt travel faster than it would with fuel."

At this level it could kill from sound alone. I could be wrong when considering  the vacuum of space.
19101,bfThiqDd9FA,"Indeed your beginning statement is incorrect, but your immediate instinct to realize the vacuum of space might negate sound, was spot on.

Sound travels through air on our planet, which is made up of multiple gasses. Without those gasses (vacuum), there would be nothing for the pressure to react against to produce sound waves."

19141,bfThiqDd9FA,"OK, COMMENTS, COMMENTS, COMMENTS."
19142,bfThiqDd9FA,Pretty cool
19143,bfThiqDd9FA,why is there a mushroom cloud on the moon if there is no atmosphere? where the shockwave and colour? why is it that speed???! how do you just so happen to be recording? the lunar rock did not get melted there was no debris. why did the cloud leave the moon? where is the brightness? why was the object so big? why was the explosion not as smooth as the rest of the video? why did the sunlight not get reflected by the debris and stuff? why was there no shadow on the moon? the chance of the object hitting the edge of the moon and not near the middle is very low.

19283,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the dust cloud is being held together by gravity and air pressure..... On the surface of the moon
19284,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah man that thicc atmosphere of moon
19285,bfThiqDd9FA,"Everything has gravity, including the moon"
19286,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@doinyomom6540 obviously it has gravity, no one is arguing that. But it does not have comparable gravity or atmosphere to earth, and that explosion looks like it was taken out of vfx software"

19288,bfThiqDd9FA,Not even the worst part. This “dust cloud” is the size of India and yet it appears in like 2 seconds. Anyone who’s seen any footage of a volcano knows this type of movement looks like it’s in slow motion because it’s so huge just being a km away let alone this distance
19289,bfThiqDd9FA,@@doinyomom6540 well no dip Sherlock. of course it has gravity. it’s just that the mushroom cloud would only be able to form if there was an atmosphere holding it together

19372,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@cmills1008 Like all nebulas, The Pillars of God is held together by the gravity of its own constituent particles. Apart from a few dust particles, space is essentially empty."
19373,bfThiqDd9FA,@@thebeetovenrider1246 right…
19374,bfThiqDd9FA,Love ? 😆 🤣 😂 😹
19375,bfThiqDd9FA,@@thebeetovenrider1246 nobody with an education believe the Moon is within Earth's atmosphere Earth is not flat the Moon is not in the firmament
19376,bfThiqDd9FA,my neighber achually found a rock from this event in his pool  the next day. No lie!
19377,bfThiqDd9FA,@@PlanetShlorpian that's called sarcasm. he's being sarcastic. I hope you were tired when you wrote this.
19378,bfThiqDd9FA,The uploader studied physics at KFC
19379,bfThiqDd9FA,È ovvio che non è vero!!!!!
19380,bfThiqDd9FA,Damm! Greys!!
19381,bfThiqDd9FA,They used the wrong aftereffects plug in 😂
19382,bfThiqDd9FA,This exactly
19383,bfThiqDd9FA,​@PlanetShlorpian some places on the moon has atmosphere for 10- 15 mins with no space suit
19384,bfThiqDd9FA,@@PlanetShlorpian Imagine if you had been able to tell that the comment you replied was obviously a joke...
19385,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud the size of the united states in seconds  so how's it held together
19386,bfThiqDd9FA,I have a dare for you rocketeers I dare you to shoot a rocket at the Moon
19387,bfThiqDd9FA,And they still lying to us smh a fucking rocket
19388,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit!
19389,bfThiqDd9FA,The best part is that a mushroom cloud isn't possible on the moon because of less gravity
19390,bfThiqDd9FA,The Taliban must be “testing the waters” of space exploration…
19391,bfThiqDd9FA,I'd love to know exactly how many petabytes of mind numbing crap like this exists on YouTube. They could save themselves an awful lot on storage by binning it off.
19392,bfThiqDd9FA,love how the dust could was lagging.
19393,bfThiqDd9FA,My god on my birthday?
19394,bfThiqDd9FA,Why did it mushroom if there's no atmosphere?
19395,bfThiqDd9FA,Sources say it took out two donuts shops on the moon.
19396,bfThiqDd9FA,smoke causally billows in space 👌👌👌👌
19397,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn seudo arachnid bugs.
19398,bfThiqDd9FA,Man.. i hate it when asteroids hit the Moon in 12fps. Crazy how nature does that!
19399,bfThiqDd9FA,Look closely at the frame rate of the mushroom cloud
19400,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice 😂🤣
19401,bfThiqDd9FA,"There's one thing I don't get, in the previous video, the moon was the same shape it was in this video, but it looked like that the rocket came in from different directions at different locations, why is that?"
19402,bfThiqDd9FA,"So fucking stupid. Our society is becoming more dumb every hour that goes by.

""Oh mY gOsH, lOoK aT tHe mOon! SomEtHinG hIt It!"""
19403,bfThiqDd9FA,not a crash. moon took a bong hit and exhaled
19404,bfThiqDd9FA,CG ?
19405,bfThiqDd9FA,same as my fart .. rotten egg smell
19406,bfThiqDd9FA,What aload of 💩
19407,bfThiqDd9FA,Its like the moon farted
19408,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh maa gaad we gona daie 😂
19409,bfThiqDd9FA,"Just like one of those ""what if the sun blows up"" videos."
19410,bfThiqDd9FA,"YEAH, AND MY ANCESTORS, THE CHOCOLATESE BUILT THEM PYRAMIDS."
19411,bfThiqDd9FA,"Personal opinion but the size of the cloud is roughly the distance of the numbers on a clock face, so ......the circumference of the moon divided by 12  is roughly 980 km ......pretty sure the mushroom cloud produced by the tsar bomb the world's largest ever nuclear warhead was only 60 km high ......the cloud produced by this supposed rocket looks to be closer to 1000 km in height ......but don't worry government were all stupid 😉"
19412,bfThiqDd9FA,I wanna see the editor
19413,bfThiqDd9FA,Apparently the rocket made a double crater.
19414,bfThiqDd9FA,Here is the 3d animator virgin trying his best with no scientific  proportions.

19416,bfThiqDd9FA,That's not a rocket it's a quadrillion rocket size.
19417,bfThiqDd9FA,Hmmm You Sure The Moon Didn't Just Fart?
19418,bfThiqDd9FA,Its a rocket that hit the moon and made 2 craters.
19419,bfThiqDd9FA,Just what the heck is THIS supposed to be????
19420,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahhahahahahhaha
19421,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣 you cold have at least made the frame rate more believable. Sheesh.
19422,bfThiqDd9FA,Careering in space for years they reckon lmao No one believes this crap
19423,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s so edited
19424,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try. 🤣🤣🤣
19425,bfThiqDd9FA,WOW!
19426,bfThiqDd9FA,Who is shooting the moon?
19427,bfThiqDd9FA,"If that is true, I can say that crash is token the space around one or two big nation/country"
19428,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing
19429,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣
19430,bfThiqDd9FA,"Vegeta: what planet have we landed on now?
Kakarot: hey, it's glowing!"
19431,bfThiqDd9FA,Bru march the 4 is my bday😂😭
19432,bfThiqDd9FA,This is obviously a phony attempt by some piece of crap on the Internet who has all of your attention
19433,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama must be their.
19434,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the smoke is moving through an atmosphere LMAO
19435,bfThiqDd9FA,This is so disturbing.
19436,bfThiqDd9FA,😆😆
19437,bfThiqDd9FA,It's not even August yet
19438,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't know how the moon visible in day
19439,bfThiqDd9FA,why do people post stupid shit like thus
19440,bfThiqDd9FA,This is way too fast.
19441,bfThiqDd9FA,It was Saitama
19442,bfThiqDd9FA,space junk = human Junk.
19443,bfThiqDd9FA,You can tell it was such a big impact because of the lag
19444,bfThiqDd9FA,This reminds me of that deleted scene from the first Star Wars movie
19445,bfThiqDd9FA,They are saying it was China. But I still don't believe it was a Chinese Rocket Booster or SpaceX though. I smell a Cover-Up.
19446,bfThiqDd9FA,What a joke!!!  You NASA 'fan boys' will buy into anything.  Never happened!  Faked video.  The video from another view has the comet/meteor strike from the opposite side.  Note the dark areas oriented more towards the left side in both videos.
19447,bfThiqDd9FA,So a super nuke hit the moon
19448,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow....dude got *hUmAn EyE* on his camera🗿
19449,bfThiqDd9FA,Pieces of Krypton finally making it to earth
19450,bfThiqDd9FA,Itna bada or clear moon kha dikhai deta h hame bhi bta do hum bhi dekh lenge😀😀
19451,bfThiqDd9FA,"Steph Curry, Whoopi Goldberg are correct moon landing was faked."
19452,bfThiqDd9FA,"There wouldn't be a mushroom cloud with no atmosphere, and it's going too fast for that distance. 😉
It had me for a second though 👍"
19453,bfThiqDd9FA,Kids don't watch this video it may lead you to wrong information
19454,bfThiqDd9FA,WAIT WHY IS THERE EVEN MOON AT DAYLIGHT
19455,bfThiqDd9FA,how big is that moon bro
19456,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fart ?
19457,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like the moon just farted
19458,bfThiqDd9FA,😻🌠
19459,bfThiqDd9FA,It's missing a poop sound...
19460,bfThiqDd9FA,'Some people comes to comments session to see who thought it was 'Moon fart'.
19461,bfThiqDd9FA,This happened on the far side of the moon nobody not even nasa got a video of this. Nice edit 👌
19462,bfThiqDd9FA,Editing softwares are becoming more and more dope! great job on this one
19463,bfThiqDd9FA,True
19464,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing... That explosion would be hundreds of miles wide if we could see it.
19465,bfThiqDd9FA,Filmography
19466,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Good one.
19467,bfThiqDd9FA,I heard about this collision with the moon. They say it was Chinese Rocket Booster from 2015 but that looked like it came to Earth from somewhere else.
19468,bfThiqDd9FA,some alien blowing phat clouds on the moon
19469,bfThiqDd9FA,"That’s cool. Next time make the mushroom cloud much slower. The moon is over 2000 miles wide, it would take a while to get that cloud that tall."
19470,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit folks
19471,bfThiqDd9FA,Wicked wicked wicked
19472,bfThiqDd9FA,This reminds me of the movie Oblivion
19473,bfThiqDd9FA,ABSOLUTE TOSH💩 don’t waste your time😂
19474,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit
19475,bfThiqDd9FA,"I was just thinking similar to the others here, like how is it possible that something that far away produce a visible smoke that fast? Should've taken a while or shouldn't be visible at all. Not to mention how fast it was."
19476,bfThiqDd9FA,"The object was moving unrealistically fast,and that ""atomic bomb"" like clouds the end threw it all off too but nice try could look better😎👍💙"
19477,bfThiqDd9FA,Physics has left the chat
19478,bfThiqDd9FA,"just a casual observation but, that asteroid would have to be massive!! Like 2 -4 % of the total size of the moon.. it impacted almost immediately (no decent) towards the surface... the impact should be a cratering event event, from our perspective, with the resultant dust forming an open topped arch (bowl).. not the depicted mushroom cloud resulting from dust being sucked in to (and circulating around) warmer  ""atmospheric"" air as it rises in an ""atmosphere..."" it's fucking space man..."
19479,bfThiqDd9FA,How where there is no air in cosmos would you see a big cloud of air?
19480,bfThiqDd9FA,How where there is no air in cosmos would you see a big cloud of air?
19481,bfThiqDd9FA,Ma la luna non c’è di giorno ???
19482,bfThiqDd9FA,Is..... is the moon okay?!? : (
19483,bfThiqDd9FA,"Due to this, the dinosaurs on the moon must have been completely extinct. Now let's capture the moon"
19484,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s not true because it’s sunny how can you see the moon
19485,bfThiqDd9FA,Some of thee most bullshit ever bro.
19486,bfThiqDd9FA,My sperm...her egg...a champion is created.😁
19487,bfThiqDd9FA,No air in space tho???
19488,bfThiqDd9FA,We'll; at least it's more convincing than the moon landing.
19489,bfThiqDd9FA,"Apollo 11 was not the first fly to the moon, so where are the movies  of the moon_mobile landing? Were tesla’s batteries used on the mission to power 110 days? My Tesla needs to be plugged for 3 hrs and only travel 250 miles, In 2022 so, here you go.
1 men Scuba diving can stay under water for 45 minutes with 2 tanks of oxygen, how many tanks where used for 4 men for 100 days? How they lift so much weight?
If oxygen were produced by electrolysis. How much water they have flied to the moon to sustain 4 men for 110 days?
And how they cool down the water during the electrolysis? Submarines can do it because are under water. NO PROBLEM, but in the moon?
In 1969 a computer was the size of a building and the first chip was invented and was not good for nothing. The next chip was invented in 1981 so, you still believing that they went to the moon?"
19490,bfThiqDd9FA,This would be all over the news if it was true
19491,bfThiqDd9FA,That's a moon fart! not bad animation.
19492,bfThiqDd9FA,That is a video of saitama punching god.
19493,bfThiqDd9FA,Earth's next😂 🌍💨
19494,bfThiqDd9FA,"Aw cmon this is the fakest shit ever

Yes, a booster crashed into the moon, but it's not possible to see it with the naked eye"
19495,bfThiqDd9FA,"It was Saitama that crashed on the moon, he was fighting garo in space."
19496,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
19497,bfThiqDd9FA,So easy to create like this 😂
19498,bfThiqDd9FA,I hear it happens to Uranus quite often.
19499,bfThiqDd9FA,someone's just finished the der eisendrache easter egg
19500,bfThiqDd9FA,BRUH
19501,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nahh, thats just a game of interstellar pong, uranus won..."
19502,bfThiqDd9FA,😅😅😅
19503,bfThiqDd9FA,"An object that size (I'd guess over 10 to 20 miles across) and velocity would create a bigger ejecta crown and it wouldn't just disappear quickly in a puff of dust, like in this video. It'd probably last hours. A lot of that ejecta wouldn't fall back to the moon, because it'd well exceed moon's escape velocity."
19504,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao
19505,bfThiqDd9FA,Puras pendejadas asen los países de alta potentecia dígale Alos países poderosos que gamas se podrá salir del planeta durante casi 100 años el humano crazy  a engañado ala humanidad  nada más vean la luna está adentro jajajaja jajajaja 😂
19506,bfThiqDd9FA,Hole left moly
19507,bfThiqDd9FA,It was as effective a blow as Hiroshima. 😮😲
19508,bfThiqDd9FA,Maybe
19509,bfThiqDd9FA,dude didn't say a word! anyone would've been talking about the event as it unfolds...but not this guy...BS.
19510,bfThiqDd9FA,Ril!
19511,bfThiqDd9FA,Nasa definitely adopt you bro .😂😂😂
19512,bfThiqDd9FA,Osea la luna esta bien cerquita?
19513,bfThiqDd9FA,I think the world is coming to an end thanks to social media💩🍺
19514,bfThiqDd9FA,This really happened
19515,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a celestial moon fart. 💨
19516,bfThiqDd9FA,"What a load of shit! Just happens to be filming at the right time and place before it actually happened... Give me a break 😂😂😂😂
That cloud wouldn't rise off its sutface to that height so quick at that distance away..."
19517,bfThiqDd9FA,Is not crash is moving cloud
19518,bfThiqDd9FA,Was this video presented as officially legit?
19519,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest video I have ever seen
19520,bfThiqDd9FA,I am wondering how many idiots will now run around and tell their friends about this bullshit.
19521,bfThiqDd9FA,Silly
19522,bfThiqDd9FA,It's not rocket it's just saitama
19523,bfThiqDd9FA,Ayo how did a mushroom cloud  grt made in vacum? Don't mushroom clouds exist on atmospheric planets?
19524,bfThiqDd9FA,... space doesn't work like that 😆😆 no atmosphere to hold a dust cloud. Next time you photoshop think how a splash in a puddle looks only with rock...
19525,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
19526,bfThiqDd9FA,Hmmm! Strange how the dust cloud doesn't have any sort of shadow...
19527,bfThiqDd9FA,Come on NASA
19528,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂
19529,bfThiqDd9FA,Good job you were randomly filming the moon as that happened eh? 🤣
19530,bfThiqDd9FA,Darn Goku is destroying our moon.
19531,bfThiqDd9FA,By reading the comments I’d say there’s a few pretty bright humans out here after all. ☺️
19532,bfThiqDd9FA,Couldn’t be faker if it tried 😂😂
19533,bfThiqDd9FA,What moon crash? All I see is our moon taking a huge fart
19534,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a bunch of bullshyt
19535,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice use of VFX
19536,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
19537,bfThiqDd9FA,What is going on there?
19538,bfThiqDd9FA,Now we wait for the governments new 'Lunar rehabilitation tax' to take effect....
19539,bfThiqDd9FA,月がこんなに大きく見えるのはなぜ？
19540,bfThiqDd9FA,cute photoshop.
19541,bfThiqDd9FA,This is faker than Joe Biden's 80 million votes
19542,bfThiqDd9FA,Those are some pretty low clouds
19543,bfThiqDd9FA,This hurts the truther movement. Why make lies up?
19544,bfThiqDd9FA,Space X Rocket..
19545,bfThiqDd9FA,"I'm calling bs,its daytime and the moon is completely visible and not discolored from the earth atmosphere.i could be wrong but still calling bs on this one."
19546,bfThiqDd9FA,haha
19547,bfThiqDd9FA,It's my birthday day
19548,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon is too big and too bright. Plus, you wouldn’t be able to see an object that small headed towards the moon. Also, the mere fact of the man randomly recording the moon is a proof in itself that this is faked as all hell."
19549,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon Vaping...
19550,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's no satellite.. either a giant spaceship crashed on the moon, or somebody bombed the hell out of the Moon.."
19551,bfThiqDd9FA,Iz feeiii
19552,bfThiqDd9FA,What amazes me more is that someone took the time to write that fakeass description
19553,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama???
19554,bfThiqDd9FA,Did moon move after hit?
19555,bfThiqDd9FA,There are no mushroom clouds in space
19556,bfThiqDd9FA,Some people are mental for a bit of editing 😏🤭😝😝😝
19557,bfThiqDd9FA,Something that fast and large would have done much more damage
19558,bfThiqDd9FA,All of this in the day time that rocket had to be big as Central Park
19559,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
19560,bfThiqDd9FA,That big a rock ( most likely the size of a small country ) would have been catastrophic for life here. It would have moved the moons Orbit effecting tides and gravity here.
19561,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow nice editing
19562,bfThiqDd9FA,Full size nuclear type explosion on the moon with fuk all gravity and there's no impact blast going around the rock. What brainyack came up with this idea.
19563,bfThiqDd9FA,it would be better if the moon was smaller and the explosion didnt seem like it had air and was at 5 fps
19564,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is much less gravity on the moon and  atmosphere, would it still make a mushroom shape??"
19565,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the framerate of the collision didn't match the framerate of the video. Who's gullible enough to fall for this?
19566,bfThiqDd9FA,ye kya hua tha
19567,bfThiqDd9FA,Totally believable...
19568,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s just a coincidence.  A shooting star passed by right as the moon was farting.
19569,bfThiqDd9FA,its just a jet hitting hyper sonic  speed  lined up in from of the moon camera shot..
19570,bfThiqDd9FA,haha moon farted
19571,bfThiqDd9FA,"Clouds don’t form in space, the ejecta would be straight lines of material. People are so stupid today it’s mind boggling"
19572,bfThiqDd9FA,Socialist reality.
19573,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
19574,bfThiqDd9FA,One day I just saw the moon so close when I went in a trip to Antarctica
19575,bfThiqDd9FA,It was no Salah - running down the wing sallaaaaah laaaa laaaaa laaaaaa the Egyptian king
19576,bfThiqDd9FA,Possible small cloud formation in Earth atmosphere.
19577,bfThiqDd9FA,If anyone thought this was a asteroid it was actually a out of control Chinese space rocket. If you search up March 4th 2022 on YouTube you probably see a out of control Chinese space rocket colliding with the moon + idk anything else
19578,bfThiqDd9FA,What happens to the space dust does float to earth or will the moons small amount of gravity eventually pull it back?
19579,bfThiqDd9FA,Tell me the owner of the video.I need him to send me to the moon through his editing expertise.
19580,bfThiqDd9FA,Imagine if the birds tweeting were a single to the crash….
19581,bfThiqDd9FA,Mono can't appear in daylight time
19582,bfThiqDd9FA,poor editing
19583,bfThiqDd9FA,On March 3 is was my friend birthday
19584,bfThiqDd9FA,"I calculate that rock to be traveling at 800km/s with a diameter of about 10 miles. Aside from the fact that that speed is impossible for an object orbiting the sun. The impact measures 1.28x10^11 megatons. Or 5.36x10^23 joules.

That’s 1280x the power of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.

You need a way bigger plume. 

The crater is gunna be about the size of the large black circle in the upper half of the moon. About 500km wide.

Would love to see a version with accurate impact ejecta."
19585,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's not a rocket part, that's Matilda from Angry Birds !!!!"
19586,bfThiqDd9FA,damn piccolo at it again...
19587,bfThiqDd9FA,"“Moooooon”
Or “Stop mocking me”"
19588,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Eastsidet03 lmao so good
19589,bfThiqDd9FA,damn when did the moon get so god damn big holly crap is it going to hit the earth or something?
19590,bfThiqDd9FA,Now why can’t cameras that feature unexplained phenomena be as clear as this?
19591,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtf was that rubbish
19592,bfThiqDd9FA,"An ""attempt"" at photoshop.

Just not a good one."
19593,bfThiqDd9FA,So ummm the camera no response like freaking out dropping the camera ah dah
19594,bfThiqDd9FA,Great Now the moon is gonna have babies🤦‍♀️You know what that means??Were gonna have a bunch of Luna tics 🤷‍♀️
19595,bfThiqDd9FA,"It was not a rocket, it was a big diamond"
19596,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing
19597,bfThiqDd9FA,There was an actual lunar impact that day. But that impact left a crater less than 20 yards wide. Does that look like it would leave a 20 yard crater
19598,bfThiqDd9FA,That was actually saitama
19599,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try 🙂
19600,bfThiqDd9FA,I have a killer view of this happening that I recorded with my toaster!
19601,bfThiqDd9FA,"When are you people going to wake up and realize that all this trickery is nothing, have we fallen as a race to the point that anything we see on you tube we Know is true ? Heaven help this race of humans, for when satan performs his falsehoods pretending to be our LORD we will fall head over heels for it.
 Be ready, all of us, for our LORD is returning soon and HE won't be in the desert or in the secret chambers, HE will return with a Shout, with the Trumpet of GOD and all eyes will see HIM in the clouds, the dead in Christ will rise first and all those alive in HIM at that time will rise to meet HIM and the resurrected dead in the clouds and woe to those who are deceived by the adversary for they, in HIS Mercy, will be dead here on this cinder of a world until HE returns with the Holy City and the saints made Immortal to live here on this world made new forever, the wicked, all those who don't belive as well as satan and his angels and all sin will have been Burned away in the lake of fire Never to be seen or thought of again, Praise HIS Name !!!!!!! Get ready it won't be long now !"
19602,bfThiqDd9FA,"Rung iso boso enggres, intine kwi palsu, hahahahaha"

19606,bfThiqDd9FA,You deserve a big like for your video editing skills
19607,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in the day? 💀
19608,bfThiqDd9FA,Sus
19609,bfThiqDd9FA,I hope some of that shredded cheese makes it to earth I like puting cheese on my food
19610,bfThiqDd9FA,An impact that large and fast would've knocked the moon off its orbit
19611,bfThiqDd9FA,👀... Mars doesn't have an atmosphere (hyper thin).
19612,bfThiqDd9FA,Whatever happened to super villains trying to blow up the moon. I miss the good all days. Simpler times.
19613,bfThiqDd9FA,OH I SEE IT NOW! It was a big ol’ asteroid
19614,bfThiqDd9FA,This happens every day. Believe it or not
19615,bfThiqDd9FA,Me when I’m playing sfs:
19616,bfThiqDd9FA,Just imagine if it did hit earth 😂😂😂😂 ohh boy extinction for at least one nation in this world!!
19617,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is so big this is fanmade the first
19618,bfThiqDd9FA,what if something like that hit Earth ELE
19619,bfThiqDd9FA,This was dope Thanls For The Video
19620,bfThiqDd9FA,The man in the moon queefed
19621,bfThiqDd9FA,I've checked and it's 🎅 new Slay having a problem
19622,bfThiqDd9FA,That explosion is the size of France
19623,bfThiqDd9FA,Editing team deserves an Oscar award.
19624,bfThiqDd9FA,Oscar Mayer award
19625,bfThiqDd9FA,How do you get a plume in zero atmosphere?
19626,bfThiqDd9FA,it is not cuz it is not how dust particals behave in vacume
19627,bfThiqDd9FA,"Isto é claramente uma montagem, muito mal feita ainda..."
19628,bfThiqDd9FA,Its not a rocket its a small meteorite well medium i guess
19629,bfThiqDd9FA,Meteor: and before I hit the moon I want to thank are sponsor raid shadow legends 💀
19630,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
19631,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust cloud only proves the moon is quite closer then nasa is telling us
19632,bfThiqDd9FA,"1: moon too big
2: 10 fps dust"
19633,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of s***
19634,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
19635,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks cool but needs work
19636,bfThiqDd9FA,Ain't no way that was a rocket it would have to be ten miles long to make that big a explosion plus it wouldn't be visible from earth a rocket nope it don't work
19637,bfThiqDd9FA,Faltu.
19638,bfThiqDd9FA,"""science has left the chat!"""
19639,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow
19640,bfThiqDd9FA,The Moon May Apear At Day Time But Not At Full Moon. i think this is edited
19641,bfThiqDd9FA,Y there smoke when no air in moon wat
19642,bfThiqDd9FA,It's edited we can't see moon in day
19643,bfThiqDd9FA,Such bs nice film making
19644,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahaha. Behold! Cloud formation in Earth’s atmosphere with the moon in the background.
19645,bfThiqDd9FA,Please tell me they ain't fuckn with the moon!? Please don't fire another guided missile at the moon again. Ok US Govt 😡
19646,bfThiqDd9FA,Urrutu
19647,bfThiqDd9FA,روزو ماه
19648,bfThiqDd9FA,It was saitama there 😂😂😂
19649,bfThiqDd9FA,it was true. I was the object
19650,bfThiqDd9FA,"Video proof that cows cannot, repeat, *cannot* jump over the moon, no matter how many have died trying."
19651,bfThiqDd9FA,falso al estar sin admodfera la luna ese polvo se desparramaria diferente no como bomba
19652,bfThiqDd9FA,Already debunked. Take it down. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
19653,bfThiqDd9FA,"What a load of BS, sure we would of heard this on the news 😂😂"
19654,bfThiqDd9FA,It's false because we all know the moon is a hologram.😁
19655,bfThiqDd9FA,"Me: stop abusing the Moon! •᷄⌓•᷅
You:💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔫(`ㅅ´🔫)"
19656,bfThiqDd9FA,'WHO' just happened to be filming the Moon at this particular time???🤔
19657,bfThiqDd9FA,I just came here to laugh😂🤣
19658,bfThiqDd9FA,Another clip of video that indirectly proves that NO ONE has walked on the moon.
19659,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh my god 🐔
19660,bfThiqDd9FA,Theres no way the moon is THAT big!
19661,bfThiqDd9FA,It was Super Man guys
19662,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny how people will believe anything they see an image of. Scary stupid people out there .
19663,bfThiqDd9FA,I turned 31 that day
19664,bfThiqDd9FA,"whoever did this has absolutely no idea. i have a few questions.
how big is the object that hits? it must be huge to see it from earth....
how fast is it? it looks like the speed of a passenger plane, but normally it would be faster as the space station flies. and it's so fast you can hardly see it with the naked eye. 
and what kind of smoke cloud is that? is there an atmosphere on the moon? no, so there's no cloud formation either. and the cloud jumps.......

on a scale of 1 to 10 for credibility, i give it a 0."
19665,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how the frame rate of the mushroom cloud is different than the clouds going by! I didn't know cameras could do that..
19666,bfThiqDd9FA,Not sure but I think you would need oxygen for fire and moon or that thing doesn't seem to carry it? Meteors burn when they crash onto earth due to entering ozone and we have oxygen here so it burns with the friction. Not entirely sure if thats the reason why theres no fire in the vid but thats my guess
19667,bfThiqDd9FA,the frame rate is off to.. account for distance🗿
19668,bfThiqDd9FA,Well now you know.😁
19669,bfThiqDd9FA,Only in the most legitimate circumstances can a camera do such a thing
19670,bfThiqDd9FA,Now you know.😁
19671,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ky1ebetts Do you know anything other than now you know ?😀
19672,bfThiqDd9FA,Now you know 😁
19673,bfThiqDd9FA,How can you gauge frame rate
19674,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ChiSpire fair
19675,bfThiqDd9FA,That dust cloud seem to clear up rather quick. Great footage.
19676,bfThiqDd9FA,This same stupid ad of horrible people  must run on YT 1 million x a day.  Not worth paying for YT and ads are too obnoxious.
19677,bfThiqDd9FA,Little liar click 👎
19678,bfThiqDd9FA,Its a Chinese rocket that hits the moon.
19679,bfThiqDd9FA,This is impossible. The moon is plasma
19680,bfThiqDd9FA,Pls learn to edit...
19681,bfThiqDd9FA,traveling at least 1LY+
19682,bfThiqDd9FA,Moonfart
19683,bfThiqDd9FA,Nicely faked
19684,bfThiqDd9FA,oh that looked absolutely believable!  nice job guys! Course our planet is full of stupid people who believe everything they see...
19685,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahhhhja🤣🤣👍
19686,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice work. When you masked it behind the clouds, you should change the opacity level. Go frame by frame and keyframe different levels according to the density of the cloud. It sorta pops out too cleanly. Really good work though. Nice tracking. I love stuff like this."
19687,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow your abundance of words def. take the bacon on all replies.  An extravagant 268 character comment is just 12 characters short of Twitters  Tweet Limit of 280! Nice work!
19688,bfThiqDd9FA,Well played on the comment
19689,bfThiqDd9FA,Literally just tried to make a really long comment saying the same thing but your answer is way more concise and accurate from an editing perspective!
19690,bfThiqDd9FA,"You should have added light/glare, an impact of that magnitude would have generated a lot of light. Play universe sandbox to get a better representation of collision physics."
19691,bfThiqDd9FA,Baloney.....
19692,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s no moon.
19693,bfThiqDd9FA,"Shouldn't the fact that the moon is devoid of atmosphere be considered? And yet, the impact plume's visible characteristics behave as an impact plume on earth would take place, a cohesive mushroom form, losing velocity with time and distance, due to gravity and atmosphere. I agree that the moon does have a gravity field, which would slow the dispersion of the debris. The debris would not remain intact, it would continue to disperse due to the lack of atmosphere.... FAKED VIDEO"
19694,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing👍
19695,bfThiqDd9FA,What an art.
19696,bfThiqDd9FA,Woh! The object even brings its own  payload of atmosphere.
19697,bfThiqDd9FA,Bahaha
19698,bfThiqDd9FA,We are so nosy why haven't we sent a spaceship up there to see what's going on
19699,bfThiqDd9FA,This is editing lmao -_-
19700,bfThiqDd9FA,What Crashed??
19701,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s a new form of art.
19702,bfThiqDd9FA,"Reminds me of how the USA actually contemplated detonating a nuke on the moon 
in response to the Soviet deployment of Sputnik. 
Main reason they didn't waste time and resources to do it: 
No atmosphere = no cloud = nobody impressed."
19703,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahh ya know just filming the moon that even though the moon appears during the day it’s still larger and brighter than normal and seeing a explosion that is commonly used
19704,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest crap ever
19705,bfThiqDd9FA,it would never raise dust like that after that impact. it will folow the curvature of the moon and keep following the same path as the direction of the rock goes
19706,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG NO WAY
19707,bfThiqDd9FA,Next video ad covers clouds. .what a bad video click bait
19708,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hey look, the moon just farted !!!"
19709,bfThiqDd9FA,The day of my birthday 😂😂
19710,bfThiqDd9FA,"""I PISS ON THE MOON"""
19711,bfThiqDd9FA,how close are you to the moon bro
19712,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
19713,bfThiqDd9FA,Вы придурки Луна она вот здесь рядом пару Км. от земли.    Так же как и Солнце. все РЯДОМ.
19714,bfThiqDd9FA,after effect work
19715,bfThiqDd9FA,Something like that would have not been visible to a human eye unless using a telescope due to the distance from earth
19716,bfThiqDd9FA,Wind on the moon? Hmmmmm
19717,bfThiqDd9FA,The name says it all video lab
19718,bfThiqDd9FA,Can you imagine the size and speed that rocked would have to be going to leave a plume of ash big probably an eighth of the size of the Moon 🌚
19719,bfThiqDd9FA,"Video editing is fun, so is photoshop. Imagine the possibilities?"
19720,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is it daytime?
19721,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
19722,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahaha 😅😂 still keeping bullshit alive
19723,bfThiqDd9FA,"Adding sound effects would have completed it.  A cloud of fire, some camera movement, if you wanted a more Michael Bays look.  But, heck, just go for it and blow up the moon for a George Lucas effect, cut to Millennium Falcon cockpit, etc."
19724,bfThiqDd9FA,This explains every question I’ve had about the moon landing
19725,bfThiqDd9FA,Who knew dust clouds in space act exactly the same as they do in an atmosphere ... oh wait ;D
19726,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the ship glitches out in the clouds 🤣🤣
19727,bfThiqDd9FA,I have a recording just like this - I need to access it with a couple of hours video editing first though.
19728,bfThiqDd9FA,The things people will do for likes. Do you expect people to believe that
19729,bfThiqDd9FA,Pure BS
19730,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh please!
19731,bfThiqDd9FA,No solo es falso por como se vio. Sino q parece q sabia q iba a chocar algo en la luna y la grabo..
19732,bfThiqDd9FA,Wonder if they determined that it is hollow?
19733,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣 we wouldn't be able to see anything like that.
19734,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama vs Boros jaja
19735,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon is looking awfully big in this video
19736,bfThiqDd9FA,"The person that made this actually thinks that people who understand the enormity of space would not call bs.
That would be a continent wide explosion at your scale."
19737,bfThiqDd9FA,WOW! and the sound reached earth through vacuum in 18 sec. 😂
19738,bfThiqDd9FA,The camera shake is an effect right?
19739,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the guy knitted a whole fricking story in the description to make the video seem more legit.
19740,bfThiqDd9FA,"1.Amazing, the Moon all of a sudden has an atmosphere! 2.The fact that the camera is set up expecting this ""unexpected"" event is amazing, also!                      
3. Only one camera on the entire planet captures it, I guess is just luck.
4. I clicked on this video to laugh at it."
19741,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool edit but plz make sense while making...
19742,bfThiqDd9FA,Truth i saw the cloud but not the hit. Stepped out to smoke a cig on porch looked right at the moon and saw a mushroom cloud and said WTF Something hit the moon or what i just looked at it for a few and said wtf then saw the video a month later i could not believe it but God as my witness i saw that Shit.
19743,bfThiqDd9FA,**Me when I purposefully spread misinformation on the internet**

19748,bfThiqDd9FA,Good editing
19749,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker than a football bat
19750,bfThiqDd9FA,The man on the moon just had a little Puff
19751,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud behaves as if the Moon has atmosphere!
19752,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the dust just disapears🤣🤣
19753,bfThiqDd9FA,nice vfx
19754,bfThiqDd9FA,When you download your first video editor... 🤣
19755,bfThiqDd9FA,Elon trying to escape....
19756,bfThiqDd9FA,"First: the projectile or whatever object that is, struggled to realistically pass behind the clouds, editing flaw 😆. Second: the mushroom cloud caused by the impact was too fast to form, almost at the speed of light, which is impossible. And will it even form a cloud without atmosphere. Almost like it happened in just a few kilometers away from the observer. The physics is too unrealistic."
19757,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂
19758,bfThiqDd9FA,nah bro saitama was just blasted off to the moon
19759,bfThiqDd9FA,How moon is so clear
19760,bfThiqDd9FA,That's a new world Guinness record
19761,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm sorry guys. There is much more to this. Not to mention the fact that the U.S. is just so happen to make the trip back there. Why?  Hmmm.
19762,bfThiqDd9FA,I GET BONET WATCH THIS SHIT
19763,bfThiqDd9FA,"Love how the “crash” creates a mushroom cloud, like in an atmosphere. And it just dissipates tonothing."
19764,bfThiqDd9FA,You miss the man with parachute w/o that for me i cant believe this
19765,bfThiqDd9FA,But good job on the VFX I can say it's the work of only one guy.

19768,bfThiqDd9FA,"""A rocket part that's been careering around space"""
19769,bfThiqDd9FA,It would be cool if they made the moon deflate like a popped balloon and fall to earth as a deflated bag.
19770,bfThiqDd9FA,Here's to all the flat mooners. 🤣
19771,bfThiqDd9FA,"Considering the size of the Moon whatever hits it, must be really big tho. Nice AfterEffects tho"
19772,bfThiqDd9FA,Wayword rocket

19775,bfThiqDd9FA,"Traveling approximately the speed of light... and sending up a 250,000 mile smoke plum in 2 seconds.  The world would shake. Fail."
19776,bfThiqDd9FA,"It looks like a blast happening 100 meters away...  Amazing, light is travelling from moon to the camera at an amazing speed , breaking the laws of physics.. 😐"
19777,bfThiqDd9FA,"Actually no. The light from the asteroid takes the same amount of time to get to Earth as the Moon, so they're would be no discrepancy in how fast we see the explosion."
19778,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@TheSpacePlaceYT wrong, please correct yourself with proper research. Its a common sense even kids know it. Even in earth, far places explosions looks like they are standing still"
19779,bfThiqDd9FA,I feel like the cloud of smoke should not have disappeared so fast....

Congrats, now you have 44k 👎's and only 12K 👍's."
19785,bfThiqDd9FA,"Where does the Earth’s spinning atmosphere stop, and the vacuum of space begin? At the Karman Line? Between the Exosphere and Thermosphere?
Not all scientists agree that the exosphere is really a part of the atmosphere. Some scientists consider the thermosphere the uppermost part of Earth's atmosphere, and think that the exosphere is really just part of space. However, other scientists do consider the exosphere part of our planet's atmosphere.
How is the atmosphere, which is a gas, and the Earth which is a solid, and the water, which is a liquid, all moving at the same speed as one body? And if the atmosphere is a gas, how is it different from other gases like wind from hurricanes or simple directional breezes? Inertia is the term that describes why we don’t sense the movement. But using the train or plane analogy, we must take into account the physical barrier, steel, aluminum, glass, etc...that prevents the resistance force to be felt. Roll down the window of your car and those forces will be felt. That leads to my question: at what point in the upper atmosphere does this invisible protective barrier exist? The exosphere or thermosphere or the Kármán line."
19786,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah nah
19787,bfThiqDd9FA,Palsu
19788,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart 💨
19789,bfThiqDd9FA,An official statement from the moon: I known as the moon to millions of you earthling and home to thousand and thousands traveling aliens who zipping across my celestial well adored body and by human on earth that I am very upset and miffed that you decided to poke a hole in me with a rocket and cause a scar on my round curvy body. Wasn’t exploding bomb many years ago to find out if I ring like a bell enough? Now this!? And you expect me to house you and keep you for the upcoming colonization of my soil to get to Mars? Disrespecting my grounds won’t get you far. I’ll make sure the aliens hidden in underground caves inside me don’t allow a permanent settlement for you earthlings. Word to the wise.
19790,bfThiqDd9FA,😁🥳❤✌👌👍

19792,bfThiqDd9FA,I seen this video years ago.
19793,bfThiqDd9FA,How did the person videoing this seem to be waiting for it like they knew this would happen 🤔 my big question? I guess got connections either was that looks like a bad crash 😟
19794,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does the cloud start Rising before the object hits the surface?
19795,bfThiqDd9FA,"Something is not right here either
How explain this 
Not entirely as a warning for as 
But how Vibration can Positive and negative affect our Earth 
It's kind of stabilized resuscitation
Sort of 
There is planty meteorite as dust aswel and that is also a problem from time to time"
19796,bfThiqDd9FA,Isn't that Saitama? Fuck dude.

19809,bfThiqDd9FA,Why do people post this shit
19810,bfThiqDd9FA,Totally missed that on the news
19811,bfThiqDd9FA,Proportion of moon as compared to trees doesnt seem natural.
19812,bfThiqDd9FA,SAITAMA got into fight and crashed in the moon
19813,bfThiqDd9FA,What is this
19814,bfThiqDd9FA,During day time how you can see the moon clearly?

19822,bfThiqDd9FA,Incredible
19823,bfThiqDd9FA,That moon was holding it in for quite some time
19824,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh deer....facepalm!!
19825,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s stupid how you can see the moon is very large compared to you yet irl moon is very far away and appears small
19826,bfThiqDd9FA,This is faker than my mother in laws teeth! 😝
19827,bfThiqDd9FA,It was looking like moon's hand for punch
19828,bfThiqDd9FA,Whole time the just tried to nuke the moon🪬
19829,bfThiqDd9FA,This is very wrong not only because of the distance and the size of the rock but because the shape of the dust makes a mushroom cloud there's a negligible amount of atmospheric pressure on the moon to none which would not make the dust form a inverted cone instead of a mushroom cloud.
19830,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit I’ve ever seen!!
19831,bfThiqDd9FA,It literally makes no sense for gas to move like that in space
19832,bfThiqDd9FA,"Sure as hell doesn’t look 235,000 miles away"

19836,bfThiqDd9FA,Why I'm wasting my time even looking at this s***
19837,bfThiqDd9FA,😂
19838,bfThiqDd9FA,"First let's use some physics based logic.
The moon is about a 3rd of our size.
That impact to be seen so easily and to reach that hight would be around the size of a damn small country. The blast cloud was easily over 100miles in hight.

We would have felt the impact here in earth.
The moon is only 250,000 miles away.
Just miles .

A blast with that much concussive force would have surely been felt by our planet.

Think about it.
The moon effects our gravity ,our oceans ,our weather.

So a massive heavy explosion with such force would have an impact on our planet ."
19839,bfThiqDd9FA,"Person decided to record the moon moments before, that’s no coincidence"
19840,bfThiqDd9FA,That fart so big
19841,bfThiqDd9FA,Yall know this didn't happen like this right? Please don't fall for idiocy like this.
19842,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, the rocket is the size of Texas? How can we actually see a rocket 🚀 the size of a stick pin compared to the moon????"
19843,bfThiqDd9FA,"Hunter B. said that was the biggest ""rock"" he had ever seen and just had to go up there and weigh it!!😉"

19847,bfThiqDd9FA,I can't stop laughing
19848,bfThiqDd9FA,BS
19849,bfThiqDd9FA,This happens then US showed yesterday they just come out with a new super sonic Missile 🤔🤔
19850,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess the moon 🌙 is local after all
19851,bfThiqDd9FA,I wonder how you knew when to film that.
19852,bfThiqDd9FA,"Its not a moon crash,it's moon fart.🤣🤣🤣"
19853,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
19854,bfThiqDd9FA,Nuclear testing
19855,bfThiqDd9FA,😄🤪🤗🙃
19856,bfThiqDd9FA,We wouldn't be able to see that type of activity
19857,bfThiqDd9FA,Didn’t know the moon was so visible during broad daylight
19858,bfThiqDd9FA,and we still can’t get a clear picture of bigfoot
19859,bfThiqDd9FA,"I saw a news feed that it was a rocket, But It looks like it changed direction. If it’s falling, how does it change direction?"
19860,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like a nuclear mushroom cloud... That's crazy
19861,bfThiqDd9FA,"BS!
You must be a democrat 😅🤷‍♂️🤡😂😂😂"

19863,bfThiqDd9FA,That is the finest video editing software I have ever seen
19864,bfThiqDd9FA,My question is how big was this rocket?
19865,bfThiqDd9FA,Chuck Norris walk off home run in little league.
19866,bfThiqDd9FA,So how.can we see this?
19867,bfThiqDd9FA,"Falso! por culpa de pendejos que editan, aveces no creemos las cosas de verdad, saquese a chsptm"
19868,bfThiqDd9FA,I think it was sperm hitting the egg. And someone edited it to look like outside world
19869,bfThiqDd9FA,feel bad for the aliens building a bunker on the moon incase of an emergency
19870,bfThiqDd9FA,Why did the guy or girl filming have no reaction???
19871,bfThiqDd9FA,When Elon Musk plays Universe Sandbox
19872,bfThiqDd9FA,"Camera man: Hold on let me get my camera 📸

Whatever it was: 
I'm bouts to crash on the moon you get me on camera? 📸"
19873,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny
19874,bfThiqDd9FA,thats no rocket! that was an asteroid dont believe the lies people they are hiding something big and i have a feeling thats not the only one
19875,bfThiqDd9FA,"Creo que ves muchos dibujos animados....creo que es SUPER-COCO.

19877,bfThiqDd9FA,"As querido engañarnos a todos... perooo el montaje del video esta muy bien hecho TE FELICITO, como nos quieres hacer tragar este video.??
......ES UN MONTAJE,  y lo siento pero engaña a otros. Yo NO"
19878,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 good one!  I needed a laugh today.
19879,bfThiqDd9FA,i have questions
19880,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah but who captured this footage??? Smells like fish to me…
19881,bfThiqDd9FA,It Tooted! Too many Space Tacos!
19882,bfThiqDd9FA,"I guess no one noticed the ""rocket"" disappear behind the cloud before it got to the cloud..."
19883,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon is in space and there's no air in space how could the dust cloud have raised up like that?
19884,bfThiqDd9FA,"The Moon is in our atmosphere. No one has ever really been in, ""Space""."
19885,bfThiqDd9FA,JJ abrams shot this.
19886,bfThiqDd9FA,The cloud was too big to be believable
19887,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why are y’all spreading this bullshit!
There’s so many things wrong with this!!!
Waste of time!"
19888,bfThiqDd9FA,It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman!
19889,bfThiqDd9FA,@sloan Bella what is this goddess
19890,bfThiqDd9FA,@slona Bella what is this goddess
19891,bfThiqDd9FA,It wasn't a rocket.
19892,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how that object would have to be like massive for us to see it from the earth hit the moon. Like GIGNORMOUS. Soooo dumb duh
19893,bfThiqDd9FA,Hey guys look this up because it's true they knew this was going to happen late last year this is probably a scientist they were well aware when it was going to happen they knew it was going to happen on March 4th so they set up a camera to watch it look up the article this wasn't staged
19894,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how this guy decided to film the moon during the day and just happened to capture this
19895,bfThiqDd9FA,And if u google it it says the crash was not visible to humans 🤷🏻‍♀️
19896,bfThiqDd9FA,It was Wile coyote 😂😂
19897,bfThiqDd9FA,It'll buff out
19898,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon looks like it’s smoking
19899,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon farted
19900,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how the impact makes a mushroom cloud in a vacuum 😂😂
19901,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is bullshit! I've seen rockets up close. The shuttle doesn't even have any parts big enough to be seen from earth. Possibly one of the entire rockets that are ejected. But no the couplers. That's why the net wants us to believe it was. But no, no way you'd see that from over 200,000 miles away!! This whole thing stinks to high heaven. But every country on earth lies to their people. We will never no the truth!"
19902,bfThiqDd9FA,So this person just so happens to be recording the moon right when this happened?
19903,bfThiqDd9FA,"oh! the moon has just blown) also, very bad passing through the cloud"
19904,bfThiqDd9FA,"They say it was a Chinese rocket, but don't know if it's the truth or not"
19905,bfThiqDd9FA,So something crashes into the moon and the person recording says not a word. Yeah ok.
19906,bfThiqDd9FA,Nope.
19907,bfThiqDd9FA,"We definitely would have felt changes in moon orbit as we can see it with naked eye that astroid must be 1000miles wider, and that cloud formation looks like a volcanic erection lmao 😂
Nice edit 😉"
19908,bfThiqDd9FA,Who ever edited this did pretty good
19909,bfThiqDd9FA,Still waiting to hear that bangggggggggg
19910,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ok. I can believe something hit the moon.  What I can't believe is that we can see a rocket, several stories tall and so many feet wide,  238,000 miles from the surface of earth without a telescope.  Great edit.  Next we'll have the moon no longer tidal locked and we'll be mooned by the moon as we finally see its backside from earth."
19911,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣✌️✌️🤣🤣✌️✌️
19912,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart.
19913,bfThiqDd9FA,😄
19914,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
19915,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is know one talking about this
19916,bfThiqDd9FA,Still waiting for the sound from the impact 😉
19917,bfThiqDd9FA,Someone has been watching too much Marvin the Martian from Looney Tunes.
19918,bfThiqDd9FA,complete shite
19919,bfThiqDd9FA,"Boi, you guys in this comment section sure know how to take the fun out things"
19920,bfThiqDd9FA,No dust in space
19921,bfThiqDd9FA,Its like the moon has farted xD

and  ooo wee  fun  video..!!..."
19923,bfThiqDd9FA,Great editing
19924,bfThiqDd9FA,I see the dust cloud follows cartoon logic.
19925,bfThiqDd9FA,Was that nuclear?
19926,bfThiqDd9FA,How old are you
19927,bfThiqDd9FA,@@acjcunleashed7946 Nevermind. Dumb question. I just heard this now so i jumped in late
19928,bfThiqDd9FA,Fun idea but do you know how big that thing that crashed into the moon would have to be to be visible from earth with the naked eye? If it was visible from earth and it hit the moon it would destroy the moon
19929,bfThiqDd9FA,just belive what they yall ! 240000 miles away my ass nasa has never told the truth . now there distracting the population with space photos  currently.... whats really happing?
19930,bfThiqDd9FA,IM SO TIRED OF THE LIES FROM OUR GOVERNMENT
19931,bfThiqDd9FA,Flat earthers will eat this video up all day! I could hear them now talking about how the moon is within the firmament 🤣
19932,bfThiqDd9FA,why are you randomly recording the moon.....
19933,bfThiqDd9FA,You guys stop making this type of videos.  I have coworkers freaking out . Or put disclaimers.  Some people are Gollible .
19934,bfThiqDd9FA,Mast joke mara re
19935,bfThiqDd9FA,"Amazing:

Visible craft from 384,000 km distance.
Dust plume is like 500km tall and dissipates in seconds.

Truly remarkable!"
19936,bfThiqDd9FA,Plus the fact the moon that exact date doesn't match the phase in the video.
19937,bfThiqDd9FA,This should not have been visible to us here on earth ..at least not without special equipment
19938,bfThiqDd9FA,How cool that this person was there filming at the perfect time………………………………
19939,bfThiqDd9FA,its crazy how the smoke cloud is so big and rises so fast! was very suprised it is silent
19940,bfThiqDd9FA,So… there would be no huge cloud like that because there is no ozone layer and no air for it to float like this through. Plus not much gravity
19941,bfThiqDd9FA,"This is going to cause the moon to flip it's poles, which will bring tide changes, werewolves and the Duncan high school football team.

This is all Donald Trump's fault. Yessir ree bob"
19942,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket hit the far side of the moon dude. ....Wouldn't have been able to see it on earth.....
19943,bfThiqDd9FA,"Of all the fakes that were ever faked, this is the fakest."
19944,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon be looking closer then usual
19945,bfThiqDd9FA,Project Blue beam?
19946,bfThiqDd9FA,The fakest shit I've ever seen 🤣
19947,bfThiqDd9FA,"There's an insane number of kids googling ""how far is the moon from the earth"" in this comment section."
19948,bfThiqDd9FA,"I keep telling people... if you buy ANYTHING from Acme, keep your reciepts!"
19949,bfThiqDd9FA,Makes you think you could literally jump off the moon!
19950,bfThiqDd9FA,Calling BS on this one
19951,bfThiqDd9FA,I smell a huge fart bruh
19952,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice photoshop.

If something really did the moon with kinda for, we would be feeling the affects by now."
19953,bfThiqDd9FA,It was a rocket that China released in 2014 and it was predicted to hit the moon at the time it did.
19954,bfThiqDd9FA,bad photoshop
19955,bfThiqDd9FA,Attention jack ass morons listen we live in a fucking country where if you scratch your ass wrong it’ll be on the news for fucking months at a time do you think this would go unscathed not to be seen on the fucking news y’all are fucking high as goddamn gas if this happened the dust wouldn’t plume so fast  on the moon like that you fucking moronic nim twit motherfuckers When a volcano erupts does the smoke enter the atmosphere in half a second?? Fuck no it takes a good minute or five Jesus Christ
19956,bfThiqDd9FA,Faked
19957,bfThiqDd9FA,There are so many things wrong with this  not worth typing.
19958,bfThiqDd9FA,I call BS
19959,bfThiqDd9FA,An impact of that size would have knocked the moon out of orbit.
19960,bfThiqDd9FA,I was outside with the guy that shot this video and I could actually hear the missile hit the surface of the moon it sounded like a turd dropping in the toilet… My first reaction was “ain’t that some shit“
19961,bfThiqDd9FA,What a bad job.
19962,bfThiqDd9FA,Must be a pretty heavy and big Rocket
19963,bfThiqDd9FA,"If the moon is in outer space, how come it's visible during the day?"
19964,bfThiqDd9FA,"Awesome!
I like how the ""Random"" camera was perfectly still and clear whilst sitting on what I assumed to be a tripod awaiting such an event on a very clear summer's day👍"
19965,bfThiqDd9FA,"They track everything in space. Before the rocket struck it was announced something would be crashing in to the moon and when. People already knew to look up. Its not a random position that ""just happened"" to catch it on film."
19966,bfThiqDd9FA,Could have been shooting a time lapse. It's plausible at least.

19981,bfThiqDd9FA,"Move those pesky video suggestions at the end, they ruined this experience for me 😂"
19982,bfThiqDd9FA,Dang I didn’t know the rocket brought a lunar atmosphere as a payload with that explosion. Impressive that just a tiny rocket can bring an entire atmosphere for a mushroom cloud to form!

Riiiiiight...."
19987,bfThiqDd9FA,"Not buying it. The diameter of the moon is about 2,200 miles, or the distance from Salt Lake City to New York City. A plume that large, here on earth, would take out the entire New York Metro area and then some. Scale that strike and tell me that was just a rocket."

19995,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom cloud.

20007,bfThiqDd9FA,U can kinda see the mushroom cloud lagging almost.  This is fak in my opinion.
20008,bfThiqDd9FA,The stroy is true that something did crash on the moon. But it's not this video
20009,bfThiqDd9FA,Hologram
20010,bfThiqDd9FA,Mushroom clouds only look the way they do because of atmospheric pressure and heat force the dust and smoke upwards. In vacuum it would not look like this.
20011,bfThiqDd9FA,So u happen to be filming the moon at the perfect time?
20012,bfThiqDd9FA,Next time you use Blender Mantaflow  disable vortices because you wont get them in a vacuum.
20013,bfThiqDd9FA,This video reveals the truth that the Moon is only a handful of miles wide and just outside of Earth's atmosphere. WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!!

20057,bfThiqDd9FA,No reaction

20059,bfThiqDd9FA,Major fps drop😂😂😂
20060,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have smoke from a crash anyway in space because there's no oxygen and you need that to make fire. Plus you definitely wouldn't see it that fast.
20061,bfThiqDd9FA,under skin control has begun
20062,bfThiqDd9FA,For smoke to form that big.. It would of been more then just a crash.. And the smoke would not come out white like that.. Nice try

20077,bfThiqDd9FA,How you gonna tell me a rocket booster without  nuclear payload is capable of creating a mushroom cloud nearly the diameter of the United States??
20078,bfThiqDd9FA,I guess just happen to be filming the moon..
20079,bfThiqDd9FA,Y’all are time travelers

20092,bfThiqDd9FA,What a bag of spanners 🤣🤣
20093,bfThiqDd9FA,Had me going there for a second 🤣
20094,bfThiqDd9FA,LMAO you gotta be kidding?
20095,bfThiqDd9FA,An object observed in space midday? Hmm
20096,bfThiqDd9FA,China wants the moon for military purposes. Wake up
20097,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice Edit 👍
20098,bfThiqDd9FA,"well there it is folks.. 

the fakest video I've seen today."
20099,bfThiqDd9FA,Why would the dust rise like that?
20100,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon fart
20101,bfThiqDd9FA,next one jupiter and saturn colliding
20102,bfThiqDd9FA,I always wonder how these guys are always able to record the specific thing in the perfect time
20103,bfThiqDd9FA,15 fps explosion :'DDD
20104,bfThiqDd9FA,Why was this person videoing the moon in the first place kinda susp to me
20105,bfThiqDd9FA,How are we seeing this and the moon is millions of miles away?
20106,bfThiqDd9FA,Don't believe the hype. They'll do anything to distract you from what's really going on.
20107,bfThiqDd9FA,That shit was faker than this Cuban I'm smoking...😒
20108,bfThiqDd9FA,Clippp!!
20109,bfThiqDd9FA,Fact or cAppp
20110,bfThiqDd9FA,It  killed cats on the darkside
20111,bfThiqDd9FA,"so, really rough math, but the cloud is about 1/4.5 of the moon in this. the moon's diameter is 2159 miles. this means that the cloud is about 480 miles tall... 2,500,000 feet. now, without near as much gravity? I still doubt the shit out of this. the news would have been all fuckin over this. bullshit."
20112,bfThiqDd9FA,"after that hit moon must be hurt , so that he fart so insanely."
20113,bfThiqDd9FA,Mind games
20114,bfThiqDd9FA,I 1st saw moon in day time 😂
20115,bfThiqDd9FA,"Impossible u can't see such event in thar far on moon and that gigantic, what would lighten it?"
20116,bfThiqDd9FA,It was a wayward  rocket that slammed  into the moon
20117,bfThiqDd9FA,Wholy shit theres some stupid comments on heren
20118,bfThiqDd9FA,"Damn, thats a big fart"
20119,bfThiqDd9FA,which turd burglar made this?!
20120,bfThiqDd9FA,Weird if the moon was as far away as they say...amazing you can see it from earth.....
20121,bfThiqDd9FA,I think it's photoshop 7 billion people on earth did not record this except you are strange
20122,bfThiqDd9FA,hahahahhahahahahah nice
20123,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest thing I've seen in a while
20124,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks fun! I’m going to make one of these videos. Premiere and After Effects?
20125,bfThiqDd9FA,I dunno and damn
20126,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah  just so happened to be recording the moon huh
20127,bfThiqDd9FA,North Korean navy testing missel. They missed again.
20128,bfThiqDd9FA,Absolutely Feckin Awesome! 911
20129,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is flat
20130,bfThiqDd9FA,"It’s impossible, the moon moves away from us one inch, it is impossible for it to come closer"
20131,bfThiqDd9FA,😆😆😆
20132,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow! that was incredible, I can't believe I missed it. I must have been inside doing laundry or something."
20133,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's forget about the moon for a second...did you hear those birds?
20134,bfThiqDd9FA,Trash poster ☝️ do not recommend channel 👌
20135,bfThiqDd9FA,Imagine how massive that thing mustve been to be that visible from so far away🤣
20136,bfThiqDd9FA,Pov:Someone ate a lot of eggs and farted on the moon🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
20137,bfThiqDd9FA,very good VFX.. well try bro
20138,bfThiqDd9FA,"BULLSHIRT
Thumb DOWN"
20139,bfThiqDd9FA,"The shapes made by the moon slowly turning to the dark side is much the same as it could be if it were a shiny disc slowly flipping over to a dark side. However, how come after it has been entirely dark for 3 nights, it is so suddenly fully new again? Whether a globe or a disc, why isn't the change gradual as it is up until it goes to completely dark? Neither globe nor disc moon fit with what happens."
20140,bfThiqDd9FA,Pictures prove nothing
20141,bfThiqDd9FA,complete trash
20142,bfThiqDd9FA,If space has no air then how come the cloud of smoke disappeared 🤔 it should have stayed in its last formation 🤔🧐
20143,bfThiqDd9FA,What a joke.
20144,bfThiqDd9FA,And they say it was aliens. That’s what they say.
20145,bfThiqDd9FA,So BOGUS....
20146,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon did a powder fart 🤣
20147,bfThiqDd9FA,Maybe something to do with the rocket stage that slammed into the moon?
20148,bfThiqDd9FA,Nah. That just Saitama after buying food from grocery
20149,bfThiqDd9FA,"Looks like an airplane! But can you see an airplane 237,000 miles away? Nope, not even if it was the size of Maine"
20150,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nah, i think the pilot knew what he was doing"
20151,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow...that rocket kicked up Hunter's crack stash...
20152,bfThiqDd9FA,Fack fack fack
20153,bfThiqDd9FA,"That’s a fart, only a fart can throw out that big of a plume."
20154,bfThiqDd9FA,"Might be more realistic to see it make an extremely slow-mo barely perceivable bump in atmosphere, then see a ripple shockwave slowly making it across the surface from it origin....slow is the key"
20155,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice sFx, only for dust to move that fast it would be like moving at 1/3 light speed"
20156,bfThiqDd9FA,shouldn't this be removed for spreading misinformation?
20157,bfThiqDd9FA,"You went to school. many years. Learn Physics, other subjects. then watching this ..and the blood is comming streight from the eyes :)"
20158,bfThiqDd9FA,Garbage in garbage out!
20159,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bwahahaha mama always said life was like a box of chocolates... same with this video.
The only thing that's for sure about this video is is 100% faked"
20160,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that Trump doing more bad stuff? Someone tell that turd 💩 Schiff about this so he can hold hearings!
20161,bfThiqDd9FA,பொய்யா இருந்தாலும் ஒரு நியாயம் வேணாமாடா
20162,bfThiqDd9FA,"LMFAO. Thumbs down, my friend."
20163,bfThiqDd9FA,It’s just an edit there’s no moon in the morning it must be sun
20164,bfThiqDd9FA,nice cloud in space - yep
20165,bfThiqDd9FA,The rocket was a Android because it blew up in 10fps. If it was a Apple rocket I’d believe it.
20166,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You all will fall for the iota of things!
20167,bfThiqDd9FA,why does the impact ejecta behave like it’s a cloud in an atsmophere?
20168,bfThiqDd9FA,March 4th is my birthday
20169,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
20170,bfThiqDd9FA,cute ..  looks like a moon fart.
20171,bfThiqDd9FA,How lucky must you be to randomly record the moon when an asteroid hit the moon.
20172,bfThiqDd9FA,Gravity rite
20173,bfThiqDd9FA,wow
20174,bfThiqDd9FA,"There's barely an atmosphere in space. Particles would not curl up into a mushroom cloud on the moon. Instead, the particles would be shot in an arc"
20175,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro the quandale dingle rocket crashed into the moon!?
20176,bfThiqDd9FA,Onp man ?
20177,bfThiqDd9FA,"Moon is pretty far away, not going to see anything Gomer.."
20178,bfThiqDd9FA,240000 miles away and you can see the rocket debris That clear
20179,bfThiqDd9FA,"I alway thought during day the moon is on the opposite side of the earth 

This video was taken during day"
20180,bfThiqDd9FA,POV: March forth is ur birthday 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
20181,bfThiqDd9FA,Just as long as everyone else disliked this too.
20182,bfThiqDd9FA,ah yes i  love seeing a full moon during the day
20183,bfThiqDd9FA,Beautiful shot 🥰
20184,bfThiqDd9FA,That is some of the fakest shaky cam I've ever seen
20185,bfThiqDd9FA,The.moon just farted
20186,bfThiqDd9FA,"The title should be ""moon fart"""
20187,bfThiqDd9FA,And you js happend to be recording at the right place at the right time
20188,bfThiqDd9FA,Not even realisticly made.
20189,bfThiqDd9FA,Get the fk outta here w this bs
20190,bfThiqDd9FA,What ever hit it has the power of a Nuke 👀
20191,bfThiqDd9FA,"AH-HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA! 
Very well done."
20192,bfThiqDd9FA,Stop wasting my time
20193,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats Saitama
20194,bfThiqDd9FA,lies lies lies
20195,bfThiqDd9FA,Lies ppl!!!
20196,bfThiqDd9FA,Who films the moon during the day
20197,bfThiqDd9FA,How ridiculous
20198,bfThiqDd9FA,@Chris Cashin  And you Support  senile Biden... even after he screwed our country up and falls off his bike 🤣🤣😂😂😂
20199,bfThiqDd9FA,Plot twist: We are going to die.
20200,bfThiqDd9FA,Who saws moon in day?
20201,bfThiqDd9FA,If this is actually true.... then that moon is far more closer than we are lead to believe ;)
20202,bfThiqDd9FA,"NASA or space X ran out of fuel ... OR, WW3 with the space backs and planet hoppers ??? If it was the first topic ... Thanks again sleepy Joe Biden, even NASA & Space X is hurting too ... GA$"
20203,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣 DUMB 🤔
20204,bfThiqDd9FA,Wha how it’s daytime
20205,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ahhhh, I remember seeing this. I was at a cookout when this happened. Everyone there thought the earth was coming to an end."
20206,bfThiqDd9FA,That cloud expand faster then speed of light. 😂
20207,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's pretty funny, but the directional lighting is a bit off. Also, the size, shape, and speed of the dust cloud doesn't make any sense for the scale. Making it slower, darker, smaller, and introducing a slight shockwave would add a bit of believability. Of course the frame rate is weird, but that's easily fixed in the render. I don't know how I feel about the ""rocket"" approach. The physics of this just imply that the moon is tiny and floating within Earth's atmosphere. It is funny, I'll give ya that. I am just always very much more impressed by realism and scale. Even just making the moon spin a bit or start glowing a tiny amount starting at the impact site and slowing rolling across would have that little extra ""oomph"" to get the point across."
20208,bfThiqDd9FA,Entertaining graphics
20209,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow. Great bro, could you Edit my selfie too?"
20210,bfThiqDd9FA,Cool editing…
20211,bfThiqDd9FA,Gotta work on your after effects...but when video copilot has a 30% sale I can understand your motivation
20212,bfThiqDd9FA,I like your meme
20213,bfThiqDd9FA,I forgot I even saw it 2 years ago so it can't be that cool.
20214,bfThiqDd9FA,good photomontage
20215,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farded
20216,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂such shit.
20217,bfThiqDd9FA,moon fast
20218,bfThiqDd9FA,Hmm I’ll give you a B. On your next project put more effort into it.
20219,bfThiqDd9FA,Superman and Omni-Man fighting 😳😳😳
20220,bfThiqDd9FA,All know that was just Wiley Coyote attached to a rocket!!
20221,bfThiqDd9FA,Did the moon just fart.
20222,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats its saitama
20223,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny
20224,bfThiqDd9FA,😂 we Aliens laugh at humans stupidity 😂
20225,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice fx
20226,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't see it on the news
20227,bfThiqDd9FA,A strike called Moon's fart.
20228,bfThiqDd9FA,Morning Moon 🤣🤣
20229,bfThiqDd9FA,So that’s what happens when a big ball of cheese gets hit….
20230,bfThiqDd9FA,Just here to count how many imbeciles believed this
20231,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
20232,bfThiqDd9FA,A lua peidou 🌚💨!!!
20233,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice creativity
20234,bfThiqDd9FA,Astonishing 1% like to view ratio.
20235,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker than his mom's tah tahs...
20236,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao
20237,bfThiqDd9FA,This clip shows that the moon is lacking
20238,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣😂🤣
20239,bfThiqDd9FA,"It could have been a Nuclear Weapon, one that detonated at a certain depth"
20240,bfThiqDd9FA,😃
20241,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm still waiting for the shock wave!!
20242,bfThiqDd9FA,The fact you didn't even seemed shocked vocally says it all
20243,bfThiqDd9FA,"First off, the speeds are wrong. This dust cloud would be so large it would take time to form. Also, a dust cloud on the Moon would quickly collapse back to the Moon with no atmosphere instead of continuing to rise as it appears to here."
20244,bfThiqDd9FA,*SAITAMA FALLING ON THE MOON*
20245,bfThiqDd9FA,funny fact there will be people who really believe in this montage
20246,bfThiqDd9FA,"So.......... when did the moon get an atmosphere? And why is the smoke that's traveling through the moons atmosphere, moving at a significantly slower frame rate than the rest of the video? Must be time dilation."
20247,bfThiqDd9FA,Omg don t look up!!!!
20248,bfThiqDd9FA,It is saitama has been punched by boros
20249,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon be like ouch Wtf Nigga
20250,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon in the day? And how is the rocket going that fast too the moon?
20251,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice clone stamp tool from the clouds brof. Pixar gonna pick you up any second
20252,bfThiqDd9FA,fa ke
20253,bfThiqDd9FA,Yup it's  tiamat...she did that to the sun to...go to hush puppys channel n see her...
20254,bfThiqDd9FA,Just you know... casually filming the moon.
20255,bfThiqDd9FA,They launched it from a satelite because it came from above in space.testing our satelite warfare!
20256,bfThiqDd9FA,"Very poorly made. But the thumbnail got you the views anyway. So congratulations, pretty smart"
20257,bfThiqDd9FA,"If there was a Lexus in the shot, you'd think you were watching a moonfall trailer."
20258,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks like baby fart filled with talcum powder 😄
20259,bfThiqDd9FA,I am not buying it 🤔
20260,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahahahaha
20261,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
20262,bfThiqDd9FA,What a load of hoo haa haha
20263,bfThiqDd9FA,"Dude...umm the moon moved a little when that happened, it fucking drifted slightly in the opposite direction. That's not a good thing."
20264,bfThiqDd9FA,I really hope you can tell that this clip is faked.
20265,bfThiqDd9FA,"Oh wow...just when will the London Times, BBC, CNN and other reputable outlets pick this up for news distribution!?!? 🤣"
20266,bfThiqDd9FA,Wake up people!
20267,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems way 2fast...
20268,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh no bro the moon is crashed
20269,bfThiqDd9FA,😆
20270,bfThiqDd9FA,It disspated early cause it's taking longer simulation and render times.
20271,bfThiqDd9FA,Disappointed not to see the moon crack into two half moons.
20272,bfThiqDd9FA,At 8 seconds if you slow down the video you can see the entity fly by
20273,bfThiqDd9FA,ROFL
20274,bfThiqDd9FA,"I swear I could hear loony tunes theme playing in the background, you know they should add loony tunes theme at the end of the clip"
20275,bfThiqDd9FA,Anti Gravity wouldn't allow a spew of dust.
20276,bfThiqDd9FA,"Maybe edit out the trees and slow it down x3, the clouds look good like it's zoomed in through a telescope but the trees are a giveaway that it isnt."
20277,bfThiqDd9FA,"Buford: ohhh a dinosaur movie, Buford like rough and tough
Gordon: and cue the meteor
Geo: meteorite 1 dinosaurs: 0"
20278,bfThiqDd9FA,Ridiculous.
20279,bfThiqDd9FA,Nadies que responda en español?☕
20280,bfThiqDd9FA,"The moon has no atmosphere, so rather then being a mushroom cloud, the explosion would have dispursed wodely."
20281,bfThiqDd9FA,That explosion look big enough to knock the moon out of orbit
20282,bfThiqDd9FA,"Holy shit!  When did China make a rocket the size of Rhode Island? This is crazy, guys!"
20283,bfThiqDd9FA,absolutely superb graphics !! you got me fooled for a minute .. impressive congrats on this one keep it up !! 👏👏👏
20284,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice piece of footage 👍
20285,bfThiqDd9FA,And he knew somethings going to hit the moon.....crab
20286,bfThiqDd9FA,So thats how clouds are made.
20287,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice montage...😉
20288,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted 💨
20289,bfThiqDd9FA,"Don't you all just love the way YouTube covers over 1/4 of the video time, with promoting the next video that I am not interested it."
20290,bfThiqDd9FA,I keep seeing those white spheres so far two in between two weeks
20291,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like Gru is at it again😂😂
20292,bfThiqDd9FA,What a editing and sound effects
20293,bfThiqDd9FA,🔥🔥🔥 These fires came while listening 🎧..
20294,bfThiqDd9FA,Hahaha 😆
20295,bfThiqDd9FA,To bad it didn't hit earth
20296,bfThiqDd9FA,You almost never fooled me
20297,bfThiqDd9FA,Fack
20298,bfThiqDd9FA,I found a lump of cheese the size of a house brick in my garden on the 23 March 2022 it must be from that collision. If anyone is interested the moon must be made from gorgonzola as the lump in my garden was definitely gorgonzola.
20299,bfThiqDd9FA,March 4th brotha
20300,bfThiqDd9FA,All shot on a I phone 4 😑😑😑😑
20301,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted
20302,bfThiqDd9FA,Anyone noticed how big the moon is in this video?
20303,bfThiqDd9FA,LMBO
20304,bfThiqDd9FA,It inspires me that so many people in the comments understand the science involved well enough not to be fooled.  I guess our education systems aren't as bad as people say.  :-)
20305,bfThiqDd9FA,Sheesh saitama did it again
20306,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
20307,bfThiqDd9FA,Ur telling me that dust shot up at Mach 1400
20308,bfThiqDd9FA,That debris will make up another moon.
20309,bfThiqDd9FA,more click bate yawn yawn yawn
20310,bfThiqDd9FA,Those birds… this sounds like England country
20311,bfThiqDd9FA,Wtff white goku ultra instinct so book goku he try make ultra instinct white so he as saiyan
20312,bfThiqDd9FA,That explosion looks like one that would be on Earth with an atmosphere and gravity. I call BS on the video.
20313,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice digital work.
20314,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon need gddr 5 rams.
20315,bfThiqDd9FA,Well it didnt ring like a bell like history mentioned !!!
20316,bfThiqDd9FA,They circle around the moon that isn't a crash
20317,bfThiqDd9FA,Made on nVidia :)
20318,bfThiqDd9FA,All these people must feel weird after they found out that this really happened in March 2022
20319,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah... On the far side.
20320,bfThiqDd9FA,Je surpris wow !!!
20321,bfThiqDd9FA,How is the moon big
20322,bfThiqDd9FA,Which crypto was that hitting the moon
20323,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice deepfakephoneyshapeshi
20324,bfThiqDd9FA,"If you could really see a cloud of smoke or debris after a tiny rocket hit the moon with that detail, we would be used to it. That is impossible to see with the naked eye. Look at planes you can barely see the ones flying at commercial heights. The moon is 200,000 some odd miles away without checking. That would be orbit altering scale of impact. I'm not a scientist. But I've looked up at the moon for 33 years and never seen anything close to that size anything in the sky. So back to the distance the Moon is away from us, that ""rocket"" would have to be traveling 80,000 MPS Miles Per Second."
20325,bfThiqDd9FA,"You never give up, do you?"
20326,bfThiqDd9FA,Hmm
20327,bfThiqDd9FA,And then came the Martian invasion!!!
20328,bfThiqDd9FA,SHITE! 🤨
20329,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love this stuff.  All things are possible thru christ God bless Google .   Also if China is buying the American population it will not be something that can be as affordable or cheap as some damn stimulus and all that stress but the military did just get a settlement from 3m and there's not a word about the stimulus in the budget what so ever..


Hey I'm such a pain in the 6"
20330,bfThiqDd9FA,"So there is obviously force at the magnetic poles . It's obvious that as the atlas comment and the recent comet that orbits Saturn that the magnetic poles shift according to which inter stellar event is transpiring . I'm

20331,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
20332,bfThiqDd9FA,Dust doesn't plum like that in vacuum.  Every dust particle must traverse without the roll and tumble of atmospheric resistance.  Only gravity and impact with other particles would influence the trajectory of each and every dust particle.
20333,bfThiqDd9FA,grt animation
20334,bfThiqDd9FA,Why do people put so much effort into making fakes like this? Don't they have a job?
20335,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice animation, bruv!"
20336,bfThiqDd9FA,If the earth is a globe then y would we be able to see the sun and moon at the same time in North America and my friend can also see the sun all the way in Australia? Where is the curve if it's a globe
20337,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that real
20338,bfThiqDd9FA,It happened I seen a story about it the media
20339,bfThiqDd9FA,"""thats a huge bitch"""
20340,bfThiqDd9FA,That must have been a huge rocket to see it from the ground on earth.
20341,bfThiqDd9FA,😀
20342,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is the moon so big???
20343,bfThiqDd9FA,"If a bomb is big enough to see that far away, I promise you, the moon would be missing massive chunks."
20344,bfThiqDd9FA,Isso é verdade ou mentira?
20345,bfThiqDd9FA,I’ve seen this happen a few times.
20346,bfThiqDd9FA,Horse shit!
20347,bfThiqDd9FA,There is no escaping the earth.  All that moon landing space x black bla is something else to keep ya in the dark....
20348,bfThiqDd9FA,"If space junk can do that to the moon, whats the difference  with earth, or rods of god..."
20349,bfThiqDd9FA,that means satellites and nasa captured this exact same crash huh...end scene
20350,bfThiqDd9FA,Damn!!!
20351,bfThiqDd9FA,explosion a lot more high quality that the moon itself
20352,bfThiqDd9FA,Quite good. This proves the moon is flat?
20353,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow Physics ain't shit I guess
20354,bfThiqDd9FA,Editing lvl 99999+😂😂😂😂
20355,bfThiqDd9FA,Nuclear bomd dropped on moon 😂😂😂
20356,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ow cool, the moon is vaping"
20357,bfThiqDd9FA,If I knew I could get a million views from 3 minutes of Photoshop work I would be a billionaire by now.
20358,bfThiqDd9FA,Did wile e. Coyote just crash into the moon
20359,bfThiqDd9FA,But......where is the Moon?? 🌙 🌚 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌛 🌙 🌚 🌔 🌕 🌖
20360,bfThiqDd9FA,you need brain to cheat man
20361,bfThiqDd9FA,Thump: China China China 🤣
20362,bfThiqDd9FA,Good simulation..
20363,bfThiqDd9FA,RIP Dr.Evil
20364,bfThiqDd9FA,"There would be a bright explosion, and the cloud wouldn’t mushroom, there’s no atmosphere so no convection."
20365,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣
20366,bfThiqDd9FA,ROFL. That was hysterical.
20367,bfThiqDd9FA,More realistic than the WWE
20368,bfThiqDd9FA,i was expecting shredded cheese due to the impact!! now im disappointed
20369,bfThiqDd9FA,"Meteor: Before I hit the moon, I would like to thank our sponsor Raid: Shadow Legends for sponsoring this meteor strike"
20370,bfThiqDd9FA,I heard some news stories about this that this was supposedly a Chinese rocket booster or whatever but I don't think that's what it was I think it was their military experimenting with a intercontinental ballistic missile that travels into space I don't think it had to do with no rocket launcher malfunction. Since the United States started the space force program the Chinese are practicing their strategies for a space War
20371,bfThiqDd9FA,"POWER PLANT IS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE MOON!
  WHO ATTACKED IT?"
20372,bfThiqDd9FA,Fugazi
20373,bfThiqDd9FA,While you teach me a new thing in morning altogether it's moon wow
20374,bfThiqDd9FA,is that badly done
20375,bfThiqDd9FA,Iam the king of moon and I will response those evil aliens 👽 in good time and never forget their enemity toward my moon 😕
20376,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't know moon can lead to morning
20377,bfThiqDd9FA,"Lies, the moon is flat"
20378,bfThiqDd9FA,😂🤣 🌏 🌞 🌚
20379,bfThiqDd9FA,guys dont worry the moon just farted
20380,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😭
20381,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakr
20382,bfThiqDd9FA,How we can see moon in the morning?
20383,bfThiqDd9FA,Your editing skills could use a better physics base
20384,bfThiqDd9FA,"But I would consider High strangeness activity is ramping up right now. 
     I can't even look up at the sky without seeing orbs, almost every night I experience the phenomenon at least a couple times. Been aware of the orbs for 10 to 12 years and have pieced together some experiences for my childhood. 34 years ago I realize they can read minds and speak through mine speak and they're attached me to some extent there's a connection for some reason"
20385,bfThiqDd9FA,😂 Nice try.
20386,bfThiqDd9FA,"bro, explotions without atmosphere just stay round and dont go into mushroom cloud"
20387,bfThiqDd9FA,Speed/size proportionality way out of whack. Good try 🤦🏻‍♂️
20388,bfThiqDd9FA,Bruh editing op
20389,bfThiqDd9FA,how is the moon this close XDDD
20390,bfThiqDd9FA,"prepare yourself, nucular winter is coming"
20391,bfThiqDd9FA,It looks Nice but its unbelieveable
20392,bfThiqDd9FA,Haha that spaceship must be the size of a shopping mall if you can see it approach the moon. Utter bollocks
20393,bfThiqDd9FA,"That incoming object must have been bigger than the Island of Hawaii to be visible at 1/4 million miles away. 😂. That is one big sunbitch meteorite not to have been detected as a near miss threat to Earth. Meteorite detectors didn't go off, but sure as hell twitched my bullsh't detector. It is easier to fool someone than to convince them they have been fooled, just not in this case😂."
20394,bfThiqDd9FA,"Do earth getting hit 
Outer space view 💥👍"
20395,bfThiqDd9FA,You wouldn't get a mushroom cloud without atmospheric pressure.
20396,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is not so close to earth
20397,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit I ever seen
20398,bfThiqDd9FA,Horrible editing
20399,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
20400,bfThiqDd9FA,I think this might of actually been an asteroid
20401,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like a moon-fart
20402,bfThiqDd9FA,என்னடா பித்தலாட்டம் இதெல்லாம்...
20403,bfThiqDd9FA,"oh, that explains the meteor showers"
20404,bfThiqDd9FA,That mushroom cloud would be 750 miles wide...no rocket could do that even with a 250 megaton nuclear weapon.  This is bogus.
20405,bfThiqDd9FA,Wow! What a Bullshit Bro!!!
20406,bfThiqDd9FA,"Bro the moon is the same size as the earth now how cool,👁️👄👁️"
20407,bfThiqDd9FA,Que buena resolución tiene ese celular
20408,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm surprised no one has come forward with debris from this as some of it must've fallen to Earth.  🤔
20409,bfThiqDd9FA,Mi tío esquizofrénico edita mejor
20410,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like another atomic weapon shot on the moon.
20411,bfThiqDd9FA,its looks like moon is farting
20412,bfThiqDd9FA,OMG
20413,bfThiqDd9FA,"Zdar Borče 😁👍 super video, pécka 👍 díky za zábavu 👌"

20415,bfThiqDd9FA,"You forgot the tag pointing at the booster indicating ""not to scale"". Or are you claiming that someone has sent rocket boosters hundreds of miles in size into orbit? Because even the biggest known boosters would be invisible to the eye at 250,000 miles."
20416,bfThiqDd9FA,That was iron man OOPS
20417,bfThiqDd9FA,Needs an acme sticker.
20418,bfThiqDd9FA,lmao damn you ET I told you not to drink and drive.
20419,bfThiqDd9FA,Nonsense
20420,bfThiqDd9FA,"We had to do it.
Damn you E.T."
20421,bfThiqDd9FA,THAT LOOKS LIKE A PLANE
20422,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think it's cool how the explosion releases all its energy in the form of dust, no heat or light, and it makes a mushroom cloud despite there being no atmosphere, which disappears immediately. Really makes me re-think my understanding of science 10/10"
20423,bfThiqDd9FA,How would you even see it without light energy
20424,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ibigretard9756 the sun
20425,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ibigretard9756 internet… and or muffin button.
20426,bfThiqDd9FA,I agree with the no light part but you don’t need atmosphere to knock around some dust
20427,bfThiqDd9FA,@@potatoacachalla4024 You need atmosphere for heated air to rise and cold air to rush in underneath it causing a mushroom cloud
20428,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ibigretard9756 You can look outside right now, look. No nuked and yet you can see. Impossible"
20429,bfThiqDd9FA,@@potatoacachalla4024 A dust plume wouldn't behave the way shown in the video in a vacuum for starters.  Every particle would describe a ballistic trajectory.
20430,bfThiqDd9FA,@@-BuddyGuy Exactly right.  That was a non-ballistic trajectory plume.
20431,bfThiqDd9FA,Its the Tesla’s sats’ hit by cme’s...  these bankers can control gov’t but their tech is definitely for shows 🤣🤣🤣 we are in a suspended dyson sphere no way in  nor out 🤣🤣🤣
20432,bfThiqDd9FA,"i knew that was total nonsense after 1 second, and the cloud moving at 200km/s was super stupid."
20433,bfThiqDd9FA,Crap
20434,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes there would be a mushroom cloud but what about the pulse wave you see that should travel the surface.
20435,bfThiqDd9FA,What rocket crashed from were what country what other planet
20436,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ok Neal, we know it was you"
20437,bfThiqDd9FA,aint no way ppl actually believe this shit
20438,bfThiqDd9FA,"now we're polluting space, charming"
20439,bfThiqDd9FA,;)
20440,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice editing 😁
20441,bfThiqDd9FA,"On Earth shroom shaped cloud after hit/explosion is formed by diffrent atmospheric pressures on diffrent levels above earth
So You could'nt see explosion like that on moon because there is no pressure
(sorry for my exceptional Eng. mistakes :) )"
20442,bfThiqDd9FA,Even the smoke seems to be way too close and appearing to be way too fast
20443,bfThiqDd9FA,Look at the size of the white flying object and look at the size of the Moon and look at the size of the dust cloud and look at the speed that is traveling all wrong
20444,bfThiqDd9FA,Trick photography editing 😂
20445,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
20446,bfThiqDd9FA,the moon farted :D
20447,bfThiqDd9FA,thats saitama when fighting against boros
20448,bfThiqDd9FA,This would’ve been believable if whoever made this had an ounce of common sense.
20449,bfThiqDd9FA,Funny post
20450,bfThiqDd9FA,bro the dust running on the damn source engine
20451,bfThiqDd9FA,Bwahahahaha!
20452,bfThiqDd9FA,Bull.
20453,bfThiqDd9FA,Photoshop is legit
20454,bfThiqDd9FA,That's funny
20455,bfThiqDd9FA,Jet fuel can't melt steel beams... or something like that?
20456,bfThiqDd9FA,Falso.  Perdí 30 seg de mi tiempo
20457,bfThiqDd9FA,Busted.
20458,bfThiqDd9FA,Keep working at Photoshop you'll get it right one day.
20459,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama just got ounched by goku
20460,bfThiqDd9FA,A visual reinterpretation of our economy post Biden!?
20461,bfThiqDd9FA,Did they ever find out what crashed into the Moon? I didn't hear about this on the news
20462,bfThiqDd9FA,it Sangoku
20463,bfThiqDd9FA,SAITAMA VS GAROU😂
20464,bfThiqDd9FA,It's literally not credible.
20465,bfThiqDd9FA,That rocket was my peen
20466,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao. The fakest shit ever. Now. One of virgin rockets or SpaceX rockets did do a crash landing on the moon. But we would never see it like this. It would be faint and hard to see. This was so clear and perfect that any one fool would easily believe it.
20467,bfThiqDd9FA,"Let set aside how the physics for an impact the large are totally wrong in every way, you can literally see the plum skip frames while the rest of the video stays smooth."
20468,bfThiqDd9FA,The fps of the explosion make my eyes bleed
20469,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how the dust cloud is visibly contained by the atmosphere 😄
20470,bfThiqDd9FA,"Proof that the moon is actually in our atmosphere, along with the sun and that we live on a flat plain with a dome over our flat earth."
20471,bfThiqDd9FA,Your brain doesn't have any wrinkles does it?
20472,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like the moon got a new crater
20473,bfThiqDd9FA,?
20474,bfThiqDd9FA,that rocket was the size of Texas lmao
20475,bfThiqDd9FA,What a waste of time making this video then waste 1 million peoples time. So pointless

20478,bfThiqDd9FA,that thing: bowowow
20479,bfThiqDd9FA,PLANET AND MOON ARE NEESDS AN ASTEROID AND COMET USING TO ADJUST THE POSITION OF PLANET AND AND THAT IS BELONG TO THE FAMILY OF PLANET AND MOON  ALL PLANET IN EVERY SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE A FAMILY GROUP CAME FROM THE BIRTH OF THE SUN
20480,bfThiqDd9FA,Well you definitely not the Alexander Bell that invented the telephone. 🤦‍♂️.
20481,bfThiqDd9FA,Это спутник  упал на поверхность планеты
20482,bfThiqDd9FA,nice try..but its an -F 😊

20488,bfThiqDd9FA,utter bullshit
20489,bfThiqDd9FA,If Biden had found ET instead of Elliot. 🚲
20490,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
20491,bfThiqDd9FA,there’s no air so that literally wouldnt look like that. Dust cant get dispersed like that in a vacuum that dense
20492,bfThiqDd9FA,"I´m on the weird part of YouTube again, i´ll just go to bed instead"
20493,bfThiqDd9FA,"Work on placing things behind clouds, it's kinda sloppy"
20494,bfThiqDd9FA,"proove that the moon is in they sky not in the ""space"""
20495,bfThiqDd9FA,If it were moving that fast and large enough to see the moon would have been obliterated.
20496,bfThiqDd9FA,There goes another lunar landing
20497,bfThiqDd9FA,someone just nuked the moon🤣
20498,bfThiqDd9FA,"the day we see the moon and an object THAT BIG, Is the day we're doomed."
20499,bfThiqDd9FA,"this rocket was either the size of 100 saturn v rockets, or it was going at lightspeed
also that dust is moving at like 5 fps"
20500,bfThiqDd9FA,Idk about clip… doesn’t seem natural how the dust just looks like that space?… it would see like if the dust looked more everywhere the rather a full explosion
20501,bfThiqDd9FA,XDDDDDD
20502,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks to the stupid starling satellite thing at the end I couldn’t watch the cloud dissipate
20503,bfThiqDd9FA,?
20504,bfThiqDd9FA,Next time you make a CG video you should check your scaling. This would be about 10 tsar bombas to see the projectile and to make a plume so big.
20505,bfThiqDd9FA,Whew! The moon almost deflated..
20506,bfThiqDd9FA,"Man got views....
Lmao"
20507,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon farted
20508,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂 ilusionismo 😂😂😂
20509,bfThiqDd9FA,"Good CG, bad understanding of how cameras and light works"
20510,bfThiqDd9FA,Waste my time😒
20511,bfThiqDd9FA,"Does somone believe that ? Mach 4 ???? Lmao... it's like 5% of light speed on this video ! Not mach 4. If it was it would be impossible to see it moove. And at 380 000 km, wa can't see a rocket part"
20512,bfThiqDd9FA,Why is there no sound?
20513,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edit :) make the exploding dust in more frames next time ;)
20514,bfThiqDd9FA,0:20 to 0:23 looks like a parachute that got opened too late 😂
20515,bfThiqDd9FA,Good effect .
20516,bfThiqDd9FA,Must be nice to have a little CG project catch so much attention
20517,bfThiqDd9FA,"Didn't show the part where the caped baldy jump from the moon, disappointing..."
20518,bfThiqDd9FA,How this guy knew the something is Gona Crash on the moon?
20519,bfThiqDd9FA,*rel or fik*
20520,bfThiqDd9FA,Cringe af
20521,bfThiqDd9FA,I think it's a meteor or asteroid
20522,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud has lower fps cuz it takes 1 second for light to go to the moon and back into our eyes
20523,bfThiqDd9FA,lmao
20524,bfThiqDd9FA,Really man you watched to this from earth appreciate you ✌️😂🤣
20525,bfThiqDd9FA,Mmm k...
20526,bfThiqDd9FA,How does the moon come out early
20527,bfThiqDd9FA,Day moon
20528,bfThiqDd9FA,Day moon
20529,bfThiqDd9FA,No jajajaja 🤣
20530,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice effects

20532,bfThiqDd9FA,🌈🦧💬IM GOD JIM!!!!!
20533,bfThiqDd9FA,Booogus video!
20534,bfThiqDd9FA,Impossible
20535,bfThiqDd9FA,XD
20536,bfThiqDd9FA,How has it crashed I thought the was no atmosphere how can it it like that UFO
20537,bfThiqDd9FA,Great trick photography... Hollywood is hiring you
20538,bfThiqDd9FA,Your not my guy buddy
20539,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
20540,bfThiqDd9FA,Stars wars 😳
20541,bfThiqDd9FA,"Only critique; this is way too fast for realistic approach and the resulting debris cloud. Orbital velocity of something hitting the moon might be as high as 100,000 miles an hour. If the moon is about 2000 miles wide, it would take  about one minute to cover the moon's diameter, and the cloud would take many seconds to reach what you show in a couple seconds. I know the public's goldfish attention span wouldn't allow these ""long"" time periods. Otherwise it's great."
20542,bfThiqDd9FA,There is no atmosphere in moon this animation is bullshit
20543,bfThiqDd9FA,I am watching this from mars too 🤯🤯
20544,bfThiqDd9FA,That proves it! The earth is flat
20545,bfThiqDd9FA,😂🤣
20546,bfThiqDd9FA,That mustve been a huge ass rocket
20547,bfThiqDd9FA,Aw crap someone filmed my baseball hitting the moon.
20548,bfThiqDd9FA,Observations.
20549,bfThiqDd9FA,I have other things to do with my time thanks.
20550,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks mom Colleen that reminds me of moms surgery thanks wow.
20551,bfThiqDd9FA,"Natural love sign that some one still loves us down here. The cloud busted into a heart shape.👍✨✨✨
🎉😊👏😁👏😃🎉
Congratulations!"
20552,bfThiqDd9FA,Heart shaped cloud covered the love
20553,bfThiqDd9FA,A heart shape really love you to.
20554,bfThiqDd9FA,So given enough for all of then.
20555,bfThiqDd9FA,So moon made for all of us as well?  Thanks moon!
20556,bfThiqDd9FA,Yeah i heard the sound aahhhhhhh at the last part
20557,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakest shit ive seen in my entire life 😂😭
20558,bfThiqDd9FA,Kkkkk aí ai povo mentiroso
20559,bfThiqDd9FA,produced by india
20560,bfThiqDd9FA,"tho the moon appears small because it is, remember that little cheese wheel is bigger than any continent"
20561,bfThiqDd9FA,Bullshit
20562,bfThiqDd9FA,That was going 298k m per hour
20563,bfThiqDd9FA,Why does a dust cloud form with no atmosphere 😂
20564,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣
20565,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂
20566,bfThiqDd9FA,There is a reason this video has over 27K dislikes ....
20567,bfThiqDd9FA,I think if the moon had deflated and soared across the sky making a farty sound it would have been more believable
20568,bfThiqDd9FA,Woah the crash was so intense the dust cloud had a low frame rate
20569,bfThiqDd9FA,Da da dum
20570,bfThiqDd9FA,That's like a whole city sized object crashing into the moon.. there was no space mission set for a moon landing on that date.... fakes
20571,bfThiqDd9FA,"Gases and dust don't form fluffy clouds in vacuum. And mushroom clouds are formed because of the buoyancy of hot gases surrounded by denser cooler gases. So a big no no in the moon.

It should just be a flash and then a cone shape getting fainter as it disperses in space. Maybe even some shooting stars several hours later."
20572,bfThiqDd9FA,Night Sky
20573,bfThiqDd9FA,Pentagon is back again NASA
20574,bfThiqDd9FA,Rare phenomenon... Lunar Fart
20575,bfThiqDd9FA,What was THAT???!!?
20576,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is just above the tree ಥ‿ಥ
20577,bfThiqDd9FA,People are so stupid it's unbelievable
20578,bfThiqDd9FA,Well I guess the dinosaurs went extinct from something else then.
20579,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice effects work 👏
20580,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try 👍🏽... but stop trying
20581,bfThiqDd9FA,The worst video on the site
20582,bfThiqDd9FA,The fps dropped hard when that thing exploded
20583,bfThiqDd9FA,Era un terrapiattista che ha trovato la sua rotondità.
20584,bfThiqDd9FA,I have no idea how this works but from what I understand the size of the rocket to be seen like this in this video would require it to be at least 120 kilometers in width and height
20585,bfThiqDd9FA,Or the moon would have to be very very close.
20586,bfThiqDd9FA,this is the fakest thing i have ever seen
20587,bfThiqDd9FA,stop trying to debunk it in these elaborate ways. the moon is far to big.
20588,bfThiqDd9FA,Irs weird to see the moon during the day
20589,bfThiqDd9FA,oh Please!
20590,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmfao……..
20591,bfThiqDd9FA,fue Willy E. Coyote... 😂
20592,bfThiqDd9FA,Its a ahoax
20593,bfThiqDd9FA,Amazing the moon has a lower frame rate than earth who knew
20594,bfThiqDd9FA,This happened on 3 months ago? i should sleep though
20595,bfThiqDd9FA,Darth vader vape hits
20596,bfThiqDd9FA,I can edit it more better 😂
20597,bfThiqDd9FA,Really very hard working vediography
20598,bfThiqDd9FA,Amature editor
20599,bfThiqDd9FA,Better explosion than on URANUS.
20600,bfThiqDd9FA,it was saitama who was thrown to the moon while fighting a boros
20601,bfThiqDd9FA,BS....
20602,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon and the sun aren't that far away.  Nowhere near the numbers they give us 😒.....
20603,bfThiqDd9FA,Judging by the size of the object it must have been hundreds of miles or kilometers wide to be seen from Earth and such a small plume. Odd. Why bother.
20604,bfThiqDd9FA,What bollocks.
20605,bfThiqDd9FA,Ahahaha... Funny
20606,bfThiqDd9FA,What's just happening?
20607,bfThiqDd9FA,Fake.  The noise from that would have been so loud!  If that was real.  Plus the shockwave would have killed the person with the camera.  That was basically a nuclear bomb.  You wouldn’t be able to just stand there and film it.
20608,bfThiqDd9FA,Clouds moving in back of the moon is a sign the moon is coming closer to the Earth's core
20609,bfThiqDd9FA,I'm glad you noticed the local clouds but the moon is local too. Not moving closer. And even if it were moving closer...NASA free mason satanists tell us the moon is 238k miles away. If it were you wouldn't see our clouds behind it from that far.
20610,bfThiqDd9FA,Unlike and move on
20611,bfThiqDd9FA,"The speed at which the ""cloud of dust"" formulates, expands & disappears is WAY TOO FAST.  It would have to be slowed down by at least 5 times and maybe more for it to appear realistic."
20612,bfThiqDd9FA,I bet ya that was Trumps fault somehow
20613,bfThiqDd9FA,So that’s where clouds come from
20614,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon farted!!
20615,bfThiqDd9FA,i cant tell if this is cgi or not
20616,bfThiqDd9FA,Faker than my will to live
20617,bfThiqDd9FA,"nice animation bro, although i think you should fix the framerate on that explosion"
20618,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's not what that would look like. A very bright flash is about all you'd see. Also, much much slower"
20619,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakeistanian's fight back again
20620,bfThiqDd9FA,"Imagine taking a shit on someones bed, and then blaming the dog."
20621,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣😅 very creative tho 👏👍
20622,bfThiqDd9FA,Would have been cool if they adhered to physics (and frame rates).
20623,bfThiqDd9FA,And thats where clouds come from
20624,bfThiqDd9FA,Day moon wah wah 😂😂😂
20625,bfThiqDd9FA,Your high
20626,bfThiqDd9FA,Bro wtf
20627,bfThiqDd9FA,That no moon....
20628,bfThiqDd9FA,Parece truqueado  !!  que dijo la NASA??
20629,bfThiqDd9FA,"In reality, that object would be moving at MILLIONS of miles per hour and so would the dust cloud"
20630,bfThiqDd9FA,Is this why metropcs is down right now
20631,bfThiqDd9FA,That jump in the filming tho
20632,bfThiqDd9FA,"What this doesn’t show is the Moon broke apart a few seconds later, leaving only a crescent."
20633,bfThiqDd9FA,I know right?  We've seen that in cartoons.  💥🌙
20634,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactly
20635,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s funny!  Beep Beep!
20636,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂
20637,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣👍
20638,bfThiqDd9FA,"So THAT'S how the phases of the Moon work!
I always thought it was because of a mouse infestation eating all the cheese."
20639,bfThiqDd9FA,"...leaving only a crescent. With a woman in a red dress & sombrero, sitting side-saddle on the crescent, holding a bottle of Miller High Life in her hand. :)"
20640,bfThiqDd9FA,Croissant*
20641,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍🤙
20642,bfThiqDd9FA,That's ok. It will grow back.
20643,bfThiqDd9FA,Kirby:
20644,bfThiqDd9FA,Now that would have really put the icing on the cake.
20645,bfThiqDd9FA,"That rock was going roughly 7,920,000kmh that's a 88 times faster than the fastest asteroid ever recorded. Impressive!"
20646,bfThiqDd9FA,Buuuuuuuuuuuut
20647,bfThiqDd9FA,It was going at the imagination speed
20648,bfThiqDd9FA,"well yes, but actually no"
20649,bfThiqDd9FA,Tell us how you figured the speed of the rock.
20650,bfThiqDd9FA,@@KLSYFY google
20651,bfThiqDd9FA,"ok, spoc! go back to your station."
20652,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@KLSYFY I have since moved over to a  calculator to arrive at a speed of 2590300mph. Using the diameter of the moon 3474km, the rock taking 3 seconds to cross this distance 1158 kmps x60x60 4.1 million kmh = 2.5 mil mph. Still 50 times faster than the fastest ever recorded space rock."
20653,bfThiqDd9FA,*It was probably pushed there all the way from Klendathu.*
20654,bfThiqDd9FA,Sure
20655,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 it's not a shooting star unless the meteorite hits the atmosphere so thus it would be impossible to be further then the moon
20656,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@hulkhatepunybanner "" just a bug...ha...we humans like to think we are nature's greatest achievement, afraid it just isn't so"""
20657,bfThiqDd9FA,@Dan M if you're going to make a quote can you please credit the author? In this case it's is the last Roman emperor and the first pope Constantine l.
20658,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@maxxcon170 actually, they are closer - touching the atmosphere of Earth in speeds around 29 km/s... that creates A LOT of heat energy, so they shine like LAVA! 💖"
20659,bfThiqDd9FA,Now ain’t ya glad it the moon and not Earth?
20660,bfThiqDd9FA,Your brain needs a rework
20661,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 shooting stars are fragments entering earth atmosphere. They are way closer than the moon
20662,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 they're not actually stars🤣🤣🤣
20663,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170  just look up what a shooting star is please.
20664,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@maxxcon170 You can see an asteroid all the way out to Jupiter? I think you mean a comet. A 'shooting star' is usually a streak of light across the night sky that can be see from Earth, so there's no way you'll be able to see an asteroid or comet all the way out at Jupiter's orbit unless you happen to actually be on Jupiter.

A small meteor falling into Earth's atmosphere or a comet flying close to Earth within the inner solar system would be shooting stars, because those are the only 'streaks of light' close enough for us to see with the naked eye and even then comets, which are actually further away than the moon, will be seen in the night sky for days.  They travel fast in space, but in the night sky on Earth it appears very slow.

If you saw something travelling faster than the meteor in this video, it was only space debri falling into Earth's atmosphere. Soulreed is correct."
20665,bfThiqDd9FA,@@petejones8312 Really interesting stuff… Thanks for answering my question. Cheers!
20666,bfThiqDd9FA,"fast rock
innit?"
20667,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 shooting stars are way closer than the moon.
20668,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@maxxcon170 No, shooting stars are breaking up in earths atmosphere (usually the outer). That is far closer than the moon."
20669,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 lmao shooting stars are wayyyyy closer than the moon. They are simply just meteorites scraping against the earth’s atmosphere and causing a “spark”
20670,bfThiqDd9FA,It was a booster
20671,bfThiqDd9FA,@@KLSYFY simple math
20672,bfThiqDd9FA,That’s the Tesla that they shot into space!
20673,bfThiqDd9FA,@@KLSYFY They’re probably smoking the rock! LMFAO
20674,bfThiqDd9FA,"If it was going at that speed, it would destroy the moon"
20675,bfThiqDd9FA,Who said it was a rock...
20676,bfThiqDd9FA,@@dodology5130 Google don't know exactly everything
20677,bfThiqDd9FA,And the moon survived remember that next time they send out Tyson Michigan at nasal to scare ya
20678,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@KLSYFY I have not checked if it's correct, but not hard to calculate the speed, we know the diameter of the moon, and we know the time the object travels that distance."
20679,bfThiqDd9FA,Sometimes you just cant disconect the ludicrous speed at the proper timing.
20680,bfThiqDd9FA,@@hulkhatepunybanner Would you like to know more?
20681,bfThiqDd9FA,Impossible to see an object move that fast you can't see a bullet and that's as slow as a turtle compared to that 💯🇬🇧
20682,bfThiqDd9FA,@@maxxcon170 natürlich !! xDxD
20683,bfThiqDd9FA,It could of been a alien ship that was speeding throu….  Would explain the speed. Maybe it was traveling light?? Don’t drink and warp drive!!!
20684,bfThiqDd9FA,Ee
20685,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice work on photoshop
20686,bfThiqDd9FA,Sciences fictions 😂💭👍
20687,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@maxxcon170 if you've really seen asteroids go faster than this did you calculate this correctly? Because the rocket in this video is going at about 2,500,000 mph, the fastest asteroid EVER, the asteroid 2022 SR2 discovered by NASA this year went at a speed of 78,000~ kmph( 68.5 Mach), so are you REALLY sure you saw an asteroid go over 2.5 million mph ( faster than 78,000kmph ), it might've seemed like that just visually but if you really discovered an asteroid that fast then you would be all over the news, but how unfortunate, you did not actually see any asteroid that fast and either you made that up for even I dont know why or you just made a SLIGHT miscalculation."
20688,bfThiqDd9FA,@@hulkhatepunybanner my dude 👏

20703,bfThiqDd9FA,Caught a falling star and put it in your pocket and save it for a rainy  day.
20704,bfThiqDd9FA,Thanks NASA
20705,bfThiqDd9FA,When NASA points at the moon point got observed.

20719,bfThiqDd9FA,"You missed the brief flash on impact and the ejecta would be many lines flying outwards with trails, there wouldn't be any smoke that billows in a ball upwards asif it's in an atmosphere because its not. try again please"
20720,bfThiqDd9FA,Where's that telescope guy at
20721,bfThiqDd9FA,I see that Moonbase Alpha is now screwed as the moon breaks from Earth’s orbit.
20722,bfThiqDd9FA,"0:15 excuse me? you're trying to tell me that you can head the faint sound of the ""explosion"" at the same time we see it? That's not how sound works. On top of the fact sound doesn't travel through space."

20724,bfThiqDd9FA,Dumb the moon is transparent
20725,bfThiqDd9FA,Se que no pasará 🙃

20740,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow the explosion happen so fast it couldn't even ""render"" properly :3"
20741,bfThiqDd9FA,Need to make the dust cloud spread in strait lines. It wouldn’t look like a plum like that as there is no atmosphere.
20742,bfThiqDd9FA,That was a simulation of the XRP community going to the moon 🌙.💰💰🤑💰💰
20743,bfThiqDd9FA,You all can watch it but don't believe it
20744,bfThiqDd9FA,Ovvio che è falsa. Guardate come va a scatti il fumo sprigionato dalla finta esplosione
20745,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try but and impact on the moon wouldn't act like that as there is no atmo to force the heated gas up. It would expand like a ball from the point of impact not a mushroom cloud. LMFAO
20746,bfThiqDd9FA,One day YouTube delete useless videos to save valuable data only
20747,bfThiqDd9FA,Ultrafake
20748,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes way jo5e
20749,bfThiqDd9FA,sync the frame rates and make the explosion smaller / slower expansion
20750,bfThiqDd9FA,Se quella steroide finiva sulla terra eravamo fottuti erano guai serie per l'umanità
20751,bfThiqDd9FA,Must have been one of those star-liners
20752,bfThiqDd9FA,🧢
20753,bfThiqDd9FA,I just made a quick calculation that if this footage was true the rocket size needed to be around 350km in diameter 😂
20754,bfThiqDd9FA,LMAO!!
20755,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon just wanted to fart. Poor moon can't have a moment of privacy.
20756,bfThiqDd9FA,Who ever believe in this Video... You don't love your soul.
20757,bfThiqDd9FA,Love hoe the next video pops up dead center you can't even see the last seconds of the cloud supposedly dissapearing
20758,bfThiqDd9FA,Sentinel Prime from transformers dark of the moon
20759,bfThiqDd9FA,I didn't know the moon had a difference framerate.
20760,bfThiqDd9FA,"if you made this a good suggestion , the masrum cloud exixst because of air."
20761,bfThiqDd9FA,Something wrong here
20762,bfThiqDd9FA,Ya right👎
20763,bfThiqDd9FA,At least the scammer was so carefully to hide the rocket behind the earth´s clouds...
20764,bfThiqDd9FA,Fakea
20765,bfThiqDd9FA,"1, that rocket must be like 10x the size of the seadragon by NASA to look like that at 284,000KM distance, that thing must be going 2x the speed of light, even then an explosion like that wouldnt happen"
20766,bfThiqDd9FA,"FAKE !!
No sound of the impact.. 😂😂"
20767,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh wait guys it’s a rocket
20768,bfThiqDd9FA,How can that be visible? It must be a big explosion to even see the dust
20769,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama
20770,bfThiqDd9FA,Ok to see an asteroid that far is like a fridge on the moon that asteroid needs to be 20 empire states buildings and to make that dust cloud it needs to be thick like 50 titanics and it needs to bee going 500000 Mph
20771,bfThiqDd9FA,"I remember exactly where I was that day when it happened.
In your dreams."

20789,bfThiqDd9FA,"Wow! Pretty realistic!
Should have increased the FPS of the dust cloud as well as not make it look like it happened in-atmosphere, but other than a few other things, pretty cool."
20790,bfThiqDd9FA,The dust cloud has less fps cuz it takes 1 light second to go to the moon and back
20791,bfThiqDd9FA,That is not realistic at all
20792,bfThiqDd9FA,@@aaamogusthespiderever2566 The reason is not realistic is because of the things they just mentioned....
20793,bfThiqDd9FA,there wouldn't even be a mushroom cloud the rocket or astroid is moving way to fast and the moon is way to close
20794,bfThiqDd9FA,:D :D :D
20795,bfThiqDd9FA,what's this
20796,bfThiqDd9FA,Remember when Thanos punched Thor to the Moon? 😂

They have never come forward to admit their OWN hoax. We need better humans than you are interested in being or becoming."
20806,bfThiqDd9FA,What??
20807,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@MoreDeiftwaser If it isn't obvious to you that the video is 100% human-created using 
software, then you are a bit of a fool (sorry, but I think it's probably true).
There are several strong hints: think about scale. How big is the moon (1/4 size of earth), how far away is it (about 384,000 kilometres), and so how big would the ""space craft"" have to be in order to be visible from earth - in BROAD DAYLIGHT??? How big would the plume of dust be, and how quickly would it arise from the surface?
NOTHING ADDS UP, unless you decide not to think about adding things up.
Read some of the other comments from people who pointed out other ways in which it is obviously a faked video.
Also, read this: https://www.youtube.com/c/ViralVideoLab/about and see what you think after reading it.
It's faked video from a highly dishonest person or company who is GROSSLY misrepresenting reality and NOT really entertaining anybody in a good and decent way."
20808,bfThiqDd9FA,That was cool.
20809,bfThiqDd9FA,how does it get out of the atmosphere
20810,bfThiqDd9FA,Video fx
20811,bfThiqDd9FA,"Well done special effect. I’d use it with an asteroid hitting the surface with a slower forming impact cloud. The cloud blast rose up a little too fast if you’re looking for realism. Pretty cool though, nice work."
20812,bfThiqDd9FA,Always do your homework
20813,bfThiqDd9FA,The gravity is lighter so the dust cloud would rise faster and without an atmosphere nothing would stop it
20814,bfThiqDd9FA,This wasn't a special effect this really happened look it up scientist knew this was going to happen late last year hence why a camera was pointed up to see it happen
20815,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon has been farted on this year 2022?
20816,bfThiqDd9FA,Read the description im the video and look up the news articles related to this. It's NOT special effects.

20854,bfThiqDd9FA,fart 💨
20855,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try highschool digital editing class.
20856,bfThiqDd9FA,No gasp either?
20857,bfThiqDd9FA,Actually what looks like impact is just a rare occurence of low gravity seismic displacement. The moon's variety of volcanic activity that mostly occurs on the dark side. It rapidly dissipates in the vacuum of space and resembles meteor impact.
20858,bfThiqDd9FA,Saitama?
20859,bfThiqDd9FA,Seems legit.
20860,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
20861,bfThiqDd9FA,Very good work ! 👍
20862,bfThiqDd9FA,Ouch ):
20863,bfThiqDd9FA,I w pizdu wylądował!
20864,bfThiqDd9FA,I think it's to much😆😆
20865,bfThiqDd9FA,A mushroom cloud in the vacuum of space is the funniest part to me.  A rocket that is over 1 by 1km moving at roughly 500km/second is also pretty funny.  Suggesting this is the human-made space junk that we lost track of is hilarious.  We didn't even know it existed and then it appears 1km by 1km or so in size visible in the middle of the day moving many times faster than any other object in the solar system?  lol
20866,bfThiqDd9FA,Why would it disappear before it goes behind the clouds top right  ?   This  IS  FAKE  ...
20867,bfThiqDd9FA,"It is of course false. It's a video montage based on the ISS passing over the earth, then there was an addition of an explosion on the image of the moon... Moreover, there would be no fumes from a collision because the moon has no atmosphere!"
20868,bfThiqDd9FA,Fart in the bathtub and bite the bubbles buddy
20869,bfThiqDd9FA,"I calculated that this ""rocket"" must have been travelling at 3 million miles an hour. At that speed it could have orbited the earth every 48 seconds 🤣"
20870,bfThiqDd9FA,"If it’s moving that fast for our eyes and it’s a good what over 200,000 miles away, just imagine the velocity at which it hit the moon."
20871,bfThiqDd9FA,"Sir, your short 🚌 arrives at 2pm."
20872,bfThiqDd9FA,i give up. which one?
20873,bfThiqDd9FA,That thing looks to be at least 100KM in diameter and probably traveling at 3150000 Km/hr
20874,bfThiqDd9FA,This is just embarrassingly bad. That frame rate 😂
20875,bfThiqDd9FA,Gran turismo's new song: Moon over the explosion
20876,bfThiqDd9FA,There is no atmosphere so it’s impossible to see a cloud on the moon
20877,bfThiqDd9FA,Cap
20878,bfThiqDd9FA,Love how all “CAPTURED FOOTAGE OF MARCH 4TH!!” is different explosions. The rocket was absolutely massive as for the distance (falcon 9 upper stage). The dust cloud was so bad as well.
20879,bfThiqDd9FA,It was not a Falcon 9 upper stage. It was Chinese
20880,bfThiqDd9FA,I found wiki source that said F9 upper. (🤷
20881,bfThiqDd9FA,@@bricksofmarsmars9051 Yeah it was originally thought that it was a Falcon 9 but then they found out it was from a Chinese launch I think.
20882,bfThiqDd9FA,Oh
20883,bfThiqDd9FA,Ohh boros punched saitama and go to the moon :>
20884,bfThiqDd9FA,"What if:
The earth is flat and not a spinning ball.

The sun and moon are in our atmosphere. 

The moon is made of plasma and you can see stars through it.

All satellites are also in our atmosphere, carried up and around by huge weather balloons.

There is other footage of satellites in front of and going through the moon.

No one ever landed on the moon. And no one has ever been outside of our atmosphere. 

The government has tried to blow through the ""glass ceiling"" with nuclear warheads but were unsuccessful, every time...
It sure would change ones perspective of this video, wouldn't it."
20885,bfThiqDd9FA,AWESOME
20886,bfThiqDd9FA,scale
20887,bfThiqDd9FA,"Good edit, but the next time, try to smooth the frames per second of the explosion effect. Maybe it looks better."
20888,bfThiqDd9FA,lol for starters it would be impossible to see an object hit the moon while standing on earth 🌍
20889,bfThiqDd9FA,……what an absolute crock of 💩💩💩💩💩 Anyone who believes this dross need to seriously question their reason to be on this Earth #Pathetic
20890,bfThiqDd9FA,"Nice, but video framerate and that explosion framerate are different"
20891,bfThiqDd9FA,Apparently in a vacuum you get clouds that spread out as if in air
20892,bfThiqDd9FA,Because of course the moon is about 100x larger than normal. Lol.
20893,bfThiqDd9FA,Dunno whether to write something or scratch this rash and believe me I ain't acting.

20899,bfThiqDd9FA,What video editor did you use anyway?

20984,bfThiqDd9FA,I vote up because you really tried hard :P
20985,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice try too fast
20986,bfThiqDd9FA,no shadow from that mushroom clouds.
20987,bfThiqDd9FA,"The light is coming from the left
The moon is illuminated from the right
The dust cloud moves at 10 FPS
The dust cloud forms a few frames after the ""rocket"" hits
The dust cloud forms a mushroom shape
The dust cloud disappears seconds after forming
The dust cloud is thousands of kilometers tall
The ""rocket"" is visible from 384,400 kilometers away
The ""rocket"" travels at 900 kilometers per second
The dust cloud would be less reflective and therefore less visible
The dust cloud doesn't get pulled down by the moon's gravity at all
The moon was in its Waning Gibbous on March 4th
There is only dust from the impact
He just happened to be filming right as it exploded
The dust cloud isn't even touching the moon
The moon has too large of an angular diameter
The dust cloud casts no shadows on the moon"
20988,bfThiqDd9FA,"I like smoke animations, it was also cool, but not enough fps because it jams a bit and anyway the explosion was moving. And why this ""rocket"" completely disappeared behind the cloud and when it flew out from behind it, it suddenly appeared. Quite nice done, but not polished and not realistic."
20989,bfThiqDd9FA,Honestly this ain't too bad. Could be way better but gotta give props
20990,bfThiqDd9FA,was vector from despicable me😂😂😂😂😂😂

21017,bfThiqDd9FA,Nice edits
21018,bfThiqDd9FA,For the dust to go that high so quick would mean the dust was traveling at near light speed
21019,bfThiqDd9FA,Nah that's way faster than light speed if you do the math. Not even close.
21020,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ThorsDecree you didnt do the math
21021,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@petterlarsson7257 angular size of the moon is .52° on average when viewed from earth. Diameter of 3500km. The ""explosion"" gained an altitude of about 1000km in about one frame, assuming 30fps that's 003s. So 100000km/s.

Light is 300000km/s. So the impactor would be moving at relativistic speed of about .3-.4c.

I did indeed do the math. It literally takes seconds if you have an approximate idea of the numbers. I'm sorry math is hard for you, but that doesn't mean other people don't casually calculate things all the time.

I had assumed angular size of 1° and diameter of 5000km before looking it up so yes that works out to an explosion happening faster than light.

Take your ignorance to a library, they know how to help you with that."
21022,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@petterlarsson7257 and all that assumes the impact wasnt at an oblique angle, which would cause the actual result to be higher than the calculated one since I'm assuming an impactor trajectory perpendicular to the camera angle.

Don't come to a math fight without doing the math yourself, buddy. Numbers are immutable, your assumptions or opinions are not."

We also don't use heliocentric models for maps. Updated models of Gleason's map make more sense since they are based on reality. No pseudoscience like we were indoctrinated in school. 
I was taught in the Navy we can see up to 11 nautical miles. They are nearly the same...miles & nautical miles. Nautical miles being slightly longer. So if I can see 11 miles across the surface of the ocean and spot another vessel's hull or stern, then its apparent to me there is no curvature. That would be impossible on a sphere because the earth should have already started to curve."

And the closest point between Russia and Little Diomede Island (US) is only 2.4 mi apart. If you take a flight it will take over 10 hours to perpetuate that illusion. The pilots don't know the routes they have them take is the long way. When they could fly in minutes. Why don't YOU explain that smart ass."

21262,bfThiqDd9FA,Crazy how the dust acts the same way as if there was an atmosphere (spoiler: there isnt)
21263,bfThiqDd9FA,There isn't any dust on the moon? I always kind of suspected that it was made entirely of rocks.
21264,bfThiqDd9FA,"​@@steved6511 Perhaps not ""dust,"" but the surface of the moon is covered in a lunar soil called lunar regolith. These are essentially fragments of pulverized rock from repeated asteroid impacts. So, the moon is, in fact, not all rocks."
21265,bfThiqDd9FA,Isn't pulverized rocks called stones?
21266,bfThiqDd9FA,"Ok what i meant by dust is stuff that looks like dust, im no scientist and idk what really is there on the moon. What i do know is that when theres an atmosphere the dust or whatever you wanna call it wod have some turbolence like seen in the video. However, on the moon there is no atmosphere"

Stone would be a complete loss of the sense and that's why people sometimes say someone is ""Stone deaf""."

21626,bfThiqDd9FA,If the moon is traveling alongside the earth through an orbital path around the sun at tens of thousands of miles per hour and is also traveling around the earth at a similar speed then the moon is traveling through space twice as fast as it is traveling around/in relation to the earth because it needs to 'keep up' with the earth going around the sun as well as to also travel in respect of the earth at tens of thousands of miles per hour in order to be able to orbit the earth and this 'doubling up' of the velocity of the moon traveling through space should send the moon 'flying off course' at tens of thousands of miles per hour as it passes around the earth?
21627,bfThiqDd9FA,Exactly.. if the moon were to take such an impact.. it could only be on the side that’s flying towards the earth.. as you know.. gravity and orbits work because items will fall into each other but miss each other.. So the moon couldn’t be hit from something traveling behind it? It would have to be going faster than the moon towards earth. Nice effects though.
21628,bfThiqDd9FA,"The gravity of the earth keeps the moon rotating around it in a localised gravity well, just as the earth rotates around the sun. Did you know the sun rotates around the centre of the galaxy too? and yet the earth doesn't spin off into the distance. It's almost like supermassive celestial bodies exert a force that causes space time to bend, and objects rotating around the object to slowly fall in toward the object they are rotating around (or slowly move away, depending on their own velocity relative to the partnered objects.)"

21631,bfThiqDd9FA,"I know a 6 year old with a better understanding of how gravity effects spacetime than you. (my nephew, in fact.)

Ask your nephew to explain why this should not also have the effect of causing the moon to veer sideways and behind [and then into?] the forward-hurtling earth.
21633,bfThiqDd9FA,"Why does a moon traveling around the sun at tens of thousands of miles per hour in order to keep up alongside the earth going around the sun at the same speed not have the earth hurtle towards it at tens of thousands of miles per hour as it crosses in front of the earth in the process of going around the planet through its circular, 'lunar' orbit?"

Perhaps you'll resort to explaining in terms of a 'gravity well' around the EARTH apparently/theoretically 'flying through space' around the SUN with the EARTH but if an unchanging CENTRIPETAL FORCE is always acting what is happening to the momentum of the orbiting MOON?  The momentum is 'slowing down'/'accelerating in a different direction(s) as the MOON travels in an elongated 'parabolic arc' in relation to the fast-travelling EARTH that creates the 'illusion' of the MOON simply passing through a circling route in relation to the EARTH, always both keeping the same distance and the same momentum/'angular momentum'?  However, how can the change in direction of the MOON in relation to the EARTH which is not stationary not entail a 'yo-yo-ing'/'fluctuating' increase and decrease in momentum of the MOON as it travels forwards and turns in an 'elongated arc' through space and then turns to go around the EARTH in the direction 'ACROSS the path of' and then opposite to the EARTH'S direction of travel?

As the MOON 'accelerates' in a direction that 'crosses the path' of the EARTH its momentum 'passing the EARTH' is greater   which should result in the MOON 'flying away' off course from its circular path around the EARTH?  Just as there is no yo-yo string between the MOON and the EARTH providing the centripetal force required to repeatedly 'accelerate'/change the direction of the MOON in relation to the EARTH there is also no balanced force pushing/pulling the MOON around the EARTH and no explanation for the repeated loss of momentum of the MOON as it passes 'across and backwards' in relation to the path of travel of the EARTH around the SUN?

21656,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@robj144 Answer's 'both' right?  Or 'Both, in opposite directions with the more massive accelerating at a lower rate and, ultimately, reaching a slower constant speed'?"
21657,bfThiqDd9FA,@@robj144 ... F = MA (Force = Mass X Acceleration); A = F ÷ M (Acceleration = Force ÷ Mass)?
21658,bfThiqDd9FA,How does a moon traveling around the sun at tens of thousands of miles per hour to stay beside the earth also move across the path of the earth at that high speed and not go flying away from the earth towards the sun at tens of thousands of miles per hour but instead orbits the earth taking one whole month to do so?

See Desertphile for further details."
21660,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ScienceChap So, that's why a hula hoop going around your waist while you are on a bullet train doesn't rotate in a way that means the hula-hoop  passes in front of you at 600 mph?  The momentum of the hula-hoop in the train's direction of travel is not converted into acceleration in the form of 'movement past it becoming rotation around it's as in an angular momentum scenario?"
21661,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ScienceChap However, the difference between the aforementioned scenario and the scenario of the moon and the earth flying through space alongside eachother around the sun with the moon crossing around the earth is that what causes the moon to continually change its direction (i.e., 'accelerate') is the combination of a GRAVITATIONAL centripetal force pulling the moon inwards as its additional momentum tries to move it 'forwards' past the earth which - i.e., the GRAVITATIONAL pull - should also be having the SAME effect on the direction of the momentum of the moon that is equal to/does not exceed that of the earth whereas a hula-hoop on a moving train or a door* opening/closing on a moving train (*or even on the whole moving EARTH as a 'vehicle in space' for that matter) is not subject to the same continuous GRAVITATIONAL inwards pull/centripetal force?"

21665,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@jaywrey If you're traveling forward aboard a moving train with a hula hoop going round and round your waist the momentum must decrease as it passes backwards around your waist having moved across and in front of your waist which would be determined by the force you continue to apply to make the hoop persist in going round, creating 'tension' between waist and edge of hoop, controlling its momentum as it goes around, 'tension' staying the same because waist is moving through space at same pace as hoop pushed/pulled by waist maintaining the same distance?  The above doesn't seem to apply in the case of a moon orbiting a planet?  What would cause the apparent slow down and speeding up of the moon's momentum as it alternately 'looped around' AND then drifted along beside the sun with the planet it's moon orbiting?"

Since It takes about twelve seconds to cover a distance that is equal to three diameters of the moon, we can assume it travels at about 900km (560ml)/sec. If it's not perpendicular to us, then it's even faster. No way.

21785,bfThiqDd9FA,@@marked4death076 Most likely larger than the one that wiped out the Dinos. There would be a brand new crater on the moon and there would also be debris rays across half the moon.

Lets give the benefit of the doubt, and say it was early in the morning, sometimes you can see the moon at that time. 

How would a ""rocket"" be visible? Usually even the iss isnt visible in the daytime.

Not to mention the dust cloud, im not an expert, hell im still in school, but due to it being in space, and the fact that the moon barely has any gravity, id guess that if an impact does generate dust, it would still be visible for a long time.

Idk if it works like this so please tell me if im wrong, but i would imagine that some of the dust would just go flying forever into space."

21815,bfThiqDd9FA,watch it again
21816,bfThiqDd9FA,Couldn’t have said it better myself
21817,bfThiqDd9FA,Agreed.
21818,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@marked4death076 The moon’s diameter here is about 25 times the diameter of the moving object. I will also assume it hits the exact side of the moon, which means the center of the moon and the center of this object are as far away from each other. So, since the moon is 2,159.1 mi, I estimate this object is 86.36 mi in diameter. Absolutely massive rocket… It’s amazing the progress we’ve made in such a short amount of time, considering the rocket used for Apollo missions was only 364 ft, while just a stray part of this rocket is x1300 the size.

Also note that the rocket stays the same size throughout the whole video, which means it’s at a constant distance from the observer, which means it’s orbiting exactly along the moon’s orbital path. My guess is someone at NASA accidentally set the rocket’s orbital path to be the moon’s orbital path… It’s an easy typo to make. However, we should not let this blunder blind us from the advancements in technology showcased in this small clip. The cloaking devices, set to activate only when the rocket is behind a cloud relative to the observer, functioned pristinely… The fact that the rocket cannot be seen from behind even a mostly translucent cloud as featured in the video speaks wonders to the state of the technology."

Heres to the Beautiful Moon!"
21867,bfThiqDd9FA,Awesome answer 👍🏿☺️
21868,bfThiqDd9FA,"But the video is accelerated, clouds don't move so fast so it could be only 90km/sec"
21869,bfThiqDd9FA,What he said
21870,bfThiqDd9FA,I laughed way too hard at this
21871,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love this comment, thanks Ricardo 🤣"
21872,bfThiqDd9FA,Your calculations are more entertaining than the video 👍
21873,bfThiqDd9FA,This fax
21874,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's what convinced you? I simply looked at it for 2 seconds saw the size of the rocket, laughed and then went to the comments..."
21875,bfThiqDd9FA,Hell yes.
21876,bfThiqDd9FA,"That amount of genetic energy would have created an enormously bright flash many times brighter then the moon, let alone melting a large area, maybe several hundred square Kilometers of the surface. Large amounts of ejected surface materials would have been would have gone into space. Some of it at speeds greater than escape velocity. A percentage would eventually reach the earth."
21877,bfThiqDd9FA,Y’all can’t be serious this shit is faker then NASA
21878,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes you deserve a like and a few laughs 😂😂 it was a really good comment.
21879,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gamesgames3318 I know this is old but since no one explained it to you I thought I’d help you out. The moon is in orbit around the earth at around 1.02km/s or 3680kmh. The further away from the earth an object is in orbit, the slower it is. The object hit the moon exactly at its edge meaning it’s also in orbit with the earth in the exact same orbit as the moon. This means that 900km/s is impossible because at that orbit, an object will move closer to 1km/s. Hope this helps :)"

21893,bfThiqDd9FA,Ugh I wish I was as good as you in math
21894,bfThiqDd9FA,I don't what country you from but in our world rough calculations is far different from estimation . Don't try to be smart throwing non relatable numbers .
21895,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@bigdaddy9930 what a childish name, someone ain't been pleasing his girl and gets salty in the comments because he doesn't understand something lmao"
21896,bfThiqDd9FA,@@selectaproductions7353 haha you’ve been posting how many videos and only get ten views😂😂😂 who tf are you ridin this man
21897,bfThiqDd9FA,@@nebtheweb8885 remember moon has a thin atmosphere but it does have one
21898,bfThiqDd9FA,This guy had science
21899,bfThiqDd9FA,and at that speed the impact cloud would be perfectly symmetric and lit up
21900,bfThiqDd9FA,How tf do you know that
21901,bfThiqDd9FA,🤣
21902,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 I am not vouching for the authentication of this video.  However the moon us very visible during the day.  And right across the way is the sun as visible as ever. I have photographs of half moons, quarter moons, all in the daylight. And there is the sun bright and full. Which has me asking, how is the earth blocking the moon from the sun when they are in the sky together."
21903,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@wookieiam1 really? I only see the moon at daylight only before 10 am, is it a difference due to where we live or something?"
21904,bfThiqDd9FA,Very good graphic artist.  Sony??
21905,bfThiqDd9FA,another reason: theres no air in space tf
21906,bfThiqDd9FA,"It's okay, we all nerd out occasionally."
21907,bfThiqDd9FA,🤓
21908,bfThiqDd9FA,This comment made it worthwhile watching the clip
21909,bfThiqDd9FA,At last!!! Superior intellect.
21910,bfThiqDd9FA,❤😂smfh are u seriously serious 🧐
21911,bfThiqDd9FA,I agree very silly ..  even without doing any math . Just by the size of the thing in relation to the moon would mean it's truly massive!! Lmao
21912,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@nebtheweb8885 it can't be bigger than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. That destroyed almost all life on planet and take into account the moon is a lot smaller than earth, the moon would have been obliterated."
21913,bfThiqDd9FA,Love your irony. 👏👏🤣
21914,bfThiqDd9FA,Well the moon is obviously 2D
21915,bfThiqDd9FA,@@nebtheweb8885 Not to mention the crater would be glowing hot for a while...
21916,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 you know you can see the moon during day time, right?"
21917,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@AlphaTrad yea, in my place the moon isnt visible after like 9 because of pollution"
21918,bfThiqDd9FA,I forgot the sky differs a bit in some places it :P totally my bad
21919,bfThiqDd9FA,"Huh ?? The moon is roughly 230,000 miles away, what are you expecting to see??"
21920,bfThiqDd9FA,You got the best comment by far...Didnt waste your time on this one!
21921,bfThiqDd9FA,"That's how I feel debating Flat Earthers on YouTube.
  You could actually take them to the Moon and back in a spaceship, which would destroy at least 6 of their theory's, and after landing back on Earth they would exclaim ""That doesn't prove anything! The Free-Masons obviously spayed some sort of Hallucinating gas as soon as I boarded to make me THINK that all happened..."""
21922,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@BigCowProductions It didn't hit 'the tangent'. A tangent is a straight line that touches the curve (circle) at one point. And you cant 'hit' a tangent.
I think 'hits the edge' (of the visible disc) is fine. Wot eva."
21923,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mustang5132 But even if it's in the same orbit, the object is travelling much faster than the moon - which is why it hits it.
(Wait. It's not even actually happening anyway so what's the point !)"
21924,bfThiqDd9FA,@@cory95ify no it doesn't. There is no air on the moon.
21925,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 The moon can be seen in the day at any hour depending on it's phase. It's easiest to see when it's before and after quarter, ie. when it's 'fatter' and away from the sun."
21926,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@michaelhoste_ corre t it doesn't have 'air' it has an atmosphere, actually its an exosphere to be exact.... basic knowledge"
21927,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@michaelhoste_ yeyeye, my mistake, in my place the moons basically invisible over 9"
21928,bfThiqDd9FA,@@cory95ify ouch. what kind of atmosphere are we talking about then?
21929,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@michaelhoste_ a little bit of helium, argon and potassium. Jus because you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there! Just because we can't breathe it, again; does not debunk he atmosphere on the moon.
It is just extremely thin!"
21930,bfThiqDd9FA,"Yeah, but what do you love about it?"
21931,bfThiqDd9FA,"Of course, dude, u won ur like 👍"
21932,bfThiqDd9FA,"@NebTheWeb  BTW I liked ur comment on sat, march 4, 2023. I'm ur 100th like. Is there a prize for me? 🤣 👿 There better be one"
21933,bfThiqDd9FA,@@nebtheweb8885 🖐
21934,bfThiqDd9FA,Thank u for ur explanation😅
21935,bfThiqDd9FA,Yea the explosion would have been way bigger
21936,bfThiqDd9FA,Adoro seu comentário.
21937,bfThiqDd9FA,"i think his rough calculations are off, and since i dont know math at all, its tough to say which calculations are off and by how much.  one sec.. 1+1=3.. nope, still cant figure it out..."
21938,bfThiqDd9FA,NASA called. They need you down at the JPL.
21939,bfThiqDd9FA,Does that mean that you love it ?
21940,bfThiqDd9FA,"Your mistake is simple. You thought. To appreciate this clip you need to not think. Don't wonder. Don't apply ANY scientific basic principles. Just let your utter moron out and you can see the truth this shows. If you think, even for a moment, you will see the truth it is poor fakery. Just don't think and this will be amazing proof."
21941,bfThiqDd9FA,I love how you did all that math and spared a like
21942,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ericvinson4628 🤣🤣you're right! Just a bit of curiosity on my part and a quick mental calculation, tho...i didn'waste much time! Cheers!"
21943,bfThiqDd9FA,​@@bigdaddy9930yours?
21944,bfThiqDd9FA,Maybe it was videoed then fast forwarded I remember the time I saw an orange moon 😅more like an eclipse
21945,bfThiqDd9FA,"I love how your comment was the first  comment I came to that didn't start with ""I love."" I was all set to talk trash to you... But after reading your post I was overwhelmed by logic and math. Then I gave you a well-deserved like! ROCK ON!"
21946,bfThiqDd9FA,Let's call it for what it is and stop dancing around it: atmospheric disturbance - part of the cloud that we saw on lower left hand side coincidentally made a condensation on the right hand side of the moon. Meteor crash? More like water droplets.
21947,bfThiqDd9FA,This is BS the tree tips are in focus but your camera is supposed to be fully zoomed in.
21948,bfThiqDd9FA,e falso
21949,bfThiqDd9FA,"I knew it, moon is made of 🧀 and moon farts too. Nasa is lying"
21950,bfThiqDd9FA,MÜll!
21951,bfThiqDd9FA,This is a funny video
21952,bfThiqDd9FA,"So, thats where Russian tanks are hiding..."
21953,bfThiqDd9FA,And this is why I love DVR see something cool pause rewind record then post get one million views and likes😎
21954,bfThiqDd9FA,Do you how big that dust from the impact would be to be seen from earth do you think we are all special or is it just you being the special one. Talk to a Dr and get help it will get better
21955,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
21956,bfThiqDd9FA,"If I saw an explosion of THAT size on the moon I'd start looking for a deep, deep shelter - the rain of huge fragments of that explosion here on Earth would take a while and cause near-ELE damage I'd guess. :-)"
21957,bfThiqDd9FA,"No they wouldn't. The debris is at orbital velocity around the earth with the moon. It would largely fall back to the Moon's surface. Some might get to Earth, but not in significant quantities. The moon is, after all, around 265000 miles away..."
21958,bfThiqDd9FA,This is why all UFO recordings are 144p
21959,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao!!

21963,bfThiqDd9FA,IN the mornings the moon is visible when the sun is up
21964,bfThiqDd9FA,This is like when children are told to draw dinosaurs and the dinosaurs are larger than skyscrapers.
21965,bfThiqDd9FA,The fact that happend so quietly from here

21970,bfThiqDd9FA,"Heheheheheh,the moon farted,heheheheheheh."
21971,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think that was the cow that jumped over the moon, but he was a bit short on the jump."
21972,bfThiqDd9FA,Well done!
21973,bfThiqDd9FA,Good try!
21974,bfThiqDd9FA,All this is a lie of Hollywood people
21975,bfThiqDd9FA,it was a big moonfart
21976,bfThiqDd9FA,That wouldn't work
21977,bfThiqDd9FA,"The Holy Spirit is always in one female person on earth at a time. That person is essentially the ark of the covenant. In this time this person is trying to help and give Gods truth but all she gets is abuse from everyone because they have believed lies by Satan they are not opened to Gods truth. Abuse is of Satan and when everyone is abusing his ark his spirit what do you think happens? It comes back on you in your life. If your life seems to be be blessed then you have been given salvation and she is happy with you. But if things in your life are not then you either start fixing how you do say feel and think in a more positive way.

The Holy Spirit the 3rd of the Trinity is The Bride of Christ, The Queen of Heaven and Earth, The Queen of Sheba, The Queen of the South,Luisa, Isis, Israel, Daughter Zion, Wisdom, Mary Magdalene is the living Ark of the Covenant as The Mona Lisa the 2nd.

Truth in plain sight! Leonardo DaVinci Paintings

🦁If you calculate this year 2022 minus the year the 1st Mona Lisa died 1542=480 years, the same amount of time from Exodus to the rebuild of the new temple in the Bible. The 2nd Mona Lisa is the Bride of Christ, Queen of Heaven, Ephraim The living spirit of God on earth now - The Mona Lisa 2nd 

The second coming has already begun so When she crosses you path with nature’s help your up for judgement. Judgement of how you lived your life in this lifetime. You’ll either receive eternal salvation or eternal damnation. So I’d be thinking my words and thoughts carefully because you don’t know who she is.
Her new rules going forward will not tolerate negativity and God will continue to give you tests for issues you need to resolve. You either go with evolution or perish. 

Earths new rules Were sent by Christ and follow in the same footsteps-WE ALL need to be active in being helpful kind compassionate forgiving unified equality joyful sing&dance thoughtful peaceful empathy worship each other and love in all aspects of our lives. We should be acting feeling thinking breathing speaking in our heart and soul. 
Walk the walk talk the talk like CHRIST did. It’s that simple. Killing or hurting any of her divine children is not allowed. 🚫

I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit The Bride will not be forgiven
The Elect were given one year with her after she awoken to her true self. This year June 13th 2022 marks ONE year. The 14th also lined up with a planetary alignment. Time is up"

The moon is approximately 380000km away from the earth, light travels at about 300000km per second, and an asteroid like that one to be visible from Earth at that distance has to be insanely big, and for what we can see on the video it must at least be traveling at about 1500km per second which is insane, a hit like that would have had a much more catastrophic reaction on the moon.

22499,bfThiqDd9FA,@@mohy3396 the moon is plasma. Its not a rock.
22500,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 
The moon is not plasma, you can see this by the fact that it has a shadow, plasma is basically fire, the sun, lightbulbs, etc, you can see that your lightbulb does not have a shadow when it is turned on, you can also see that when two lightbulbs are near eachother, it doesnt cast a shadow on one another even if theres a small pencil in between. 

Therefore if the moon is plasma, it would be VERY HOT,  as bright as the sun, and doesnt have a shadow.

Lets recap your theories, that the moon is small and in our atmosphere, what problems would occur if this is true?
1. The moon would fall due to earths gravity since it is in our atmosphere
2. If it didnt fall, the moon would make waves as big as tsunamis more normal

Your counter to this was that the moon is made out of plasma. Lets see what occurs if this is true.
1. Night time would not exist due to every part of the earth being lit up by both the sun and the moon
2. The earth would be flaming hot due to the moon being a second sun and in our atmosphere
3. Water would cease to exists due to the moon being flaming hot and in our atmosphere
4. Plasma has mass, and what has mass will always be affected by gravity, therefore the moon will still fall due to it being in the atmosphere of the earth
5. If the moon was plasma, a rocket would disintegrate when making contact, it wouldnt generate dust"
22501,bfThiqDd9FA,Yes it is plasma.
22502,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 also, you still havent answered my first question"
22503,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 then give some evidence that it is plasma... god, whoever you believe in, gave you a brain to think, ears to listen, and eyes to see. Please use them"
22504,bfThiqDd9FA,What ever. Still plasma
22505,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 give me proof that it is plasma
22506,bfThiqDd9FA,Go on utube and text the moon is plasma
22507,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527   the only video talking about the moon being plasma, is a sketchy ""scientist"" from 1965 who doesnt have any other work or is even mentioned anyywhere else. 

The man only says theories and concepts, he said and i quote ""the accumulated evidence is so much on my favor"" yet he does not speak of what those evidences are. 

He claims that he has made predictions that is in 1958, and that it was confirmed, yet he does not speak of what those predictions are and who confirmed them.

He also claims that he has published a manuscript in 1954 and that its validity was reviewed by australia and that in 1964 was confirmed when princeton stated that the principles of time reversal invariance were invalid, yet i tried multiple times trying to find this manuscript which didnt show up anywhere.

The princeton article in 1964 which talks about time reversal invariance is in fact true but in the article it says ""It is possible, the group conceded, that the data may be interpreted to mean something other than that time reversal invariance is not always followed. But this possibility is held to be extremely remote"" which suggests possibility of one of the principles of time reversal invariance, which is the decay of mesons to be invalid, but at a very low chance."
22508,bfThiqDd9FA,That's the way it always is when truth gets covered up. They don't want you to know. They keep it a theory for that reason. When government and eleit hids things is going to be kept a theory.
22509,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you also cant prove the theory by this ""scientist"" 

the guy described himself with ""i was considered a lunatic"" which in australia means that he have been in a mental hospital

+ Have you not read what i said? The moon has shadows and craters, Plasma cannot have both of those, hence why the sun doesnt have a shadow or craters. Go out of your house and see for yourself that the moon has a shadow."
22510,bfThiqDd9FA,The more truth you know the more that they try to make you look like a lunatic.
22511,bfThiqDd9FA,"Just for argument sake . Say the moon is 100 percent plasma . The elites and government don't want it to be leaked out.
Do you really think they would let someone tell the truth about it.
A man some years back produced a carburetor that would get 100 miles a gallon.  They destroyed the patent and the knowledge of it and the man wound up dead. If they don't want something known it won't be."
22512,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 lets go with the moon = 100% plasma
AS I SAID BEFORE PLASMA IS VERY HOT AND LUMINOUS, add your argument that the moon is in the earths atmosphere, the moon would fry us alive by now, and NIGHT TIME WOULD NOT HAPPEN"
22513,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mohy3396 Never argue with an idiot. You’ll never convince the idiot that you’re correct, and bystanders won’t be able to tell who’s who.
;)"
22514,bfThiqDd9FA,Their is such thing as cool plasma.
22515,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 thing is, cold plasma is still bright, meaning the problem is still there

 night time will not exist"
22516,bfThiqDd9FA,"Science don't know everything bud.
They don't know all about plasma neither do you. Our father created it. He knows way more then anyone."
22517,bfThiqDd9FA,Looks like plasma dust to me.
22518,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you also dont know everything about the world either.

Not that you would even try to read everything, since last time you didnt read and just said the same thing as before ""whatever still plasma"" but let me tell you things about plasma dust, a very good example of plasma dust, are comets. And comets glow, if the moon itself was dusty non-thermal plasma, it would still glow, which would then still have the problem of night time not existing.

Now then, i noticed another thing, you believe that the rocket did in fact crash into the moon, and that a dust cloud generated. First of all, if the moon was nonthermal plasma, due to the gravity i would imagine that the rocket would only be broken inside of the moon due to pressure, if that is the case, then a dust cloud wouldnt occur. 

Plasma, is not solid, it cannot be picked up, cannot be touched, the ""rocket"" in the video therefore it would not crash on the surface of the moon, as i said before, it would disintegrate due to high heat, but you shut that down by saying the moon is nonthermal plasma, still, it wouldnt crash on the surface, therefore it wouldnt generate dust.

Funny thing is how the ""scientist"" that you told me to listen to, believes that the moon is hot plasma, he even stated that a rocket would disintegrate due to the heat.

And i see how youre running out of ideas, you stopped trying to explain the problems i suggested, and blaming science doesnt know everything, only god does. But you do not know everything that god knows, same with me, same with everyone.

Science is filled with complex things, but it all comes down to very basic rules, that can be applied to everything. And you are trying very hard to say that those basic rules, are false. Which by all means is possible, but very unlikely."
22519,bfThiqDd9FA,"All I know is that the word is true . Every bit of it. Science tries really hard to disprove it even to the point of lying.
A lot of that they do.  
These moon and stars was created on the forth day . Earth is flat and inclosed system."
22520,bfThiqDd9FA,All things are possible with Yahuah.  He laughs at men's wisdom.
22521,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 stop trolling I need to feed my family please
22522,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 even if that were to be somehow true, you literally cannot deny the existance of the roche limit, the moon would be ripped apart

youre no different than a caveman seeing what is around them and intuitively assuming their perspective must be true"
22523,bfThiqDd9FA,It's SCIENCE!
22524,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 Please Greg. Teach me how you mastered the art of trollery. I only wish to be like you one day
22525,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Enum_Dev you just got to care about people enough to tell them the truth even tho you know your going to get a lot of back lash from people that are brianwashed by the system.
22526,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 Thank you troll king!
22527,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 You do know that you're not talking to woke people right? They can't really hear you through the condition that prevents them from doing so.
22528,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 well “they” aren’t going to have to put much effort into that with you buddy.  You show no proof just cite youtube videos, where literally anyone can post.  No vetting. “They” figure were smart enough to spot the bullshit and ignore it but they forget there are people like yourself who will believe anything they hear that’s out of left field in order to make themselves feel like they know some secret that everyone else doesn’t. .  To think that of all the geniuses and great minds that have worked on planetary sconce over the centuries, that you and a few other conspiracy nuts hold the truth?  Really?  It’s really an extension of narcissism if you think about it.
So explain this Mr Wizard… hundreds of thousands of people worked on the moon landings which couldn’t have occurred if the moon were made of “plasma” as you say.  12 men actually walked on it. It’s been 53 years since this happened.  And you’re actually suggesting that of those thousands of people, NOT ONE OF THEM decided the beans should be spilled?  NOT ONE got hard up, needed the money, and did a book deal?  NOT ONE just wanted their 15 min of fame and told the world?   In 1997 the Potus got a bj in the Oval Office and only 2 people knew.  Within 6 months the whole country knew. Yet you’re suggesting that in 53 years thousands of people have banded together, ignoring all these situations I mentioned, and kept a secret for no reason?  Yeah that’s plausible.  Please grab your tinfoil hat and go back to mommy’s basement, and let the adults talk."
22529,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 you don’t even know how to use the language correctly, but you seem to think we should ignore empirical data and listen to you.  Science doesn’t know everything but unlike yourself, it uses actual data and facts to demonstrate the validity of what it does know and no, that isn’t all based on YouTube videos."
22530,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ebeckman1011 yeah and every time it has been debunked they delete it from view
22531,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 god who ties your shoes in the morning?   You have no proof whatsoever other that a few conspiracy theorist YouTube videos.  Meanwhile there are moon rocks, people who went there, scientific data, but by all means cling to these “expert videos”.  I noticed you completely ignored what I said about there being no way to keep all these people quiet. That’s the funny thing about these narcissistic conspiracy toting shit shows, any time you hit them with facts or logic they change the subject or talk about one aspect, while completely ignoring the mountain of evidence.  It must be so lonely in that basement with all your tin foil gadgets. I guess that’s why you answered a thread from a month ago in like 20 min"
22532,bfThiqDd9FA,Thank you I was just wondering if the moon is in space and there's no air in space how could it react like that upon impact
22533,bfThiqDd9FA,@@mohy3396 no gravity.  Dats a hoax. Gravity was nothing more than a theory. Da earth is covered by a dome and everything is underneath. we’re in a simulation matrix.
22534,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gabrielmiles1376 and how exactly does things fall? What makes us stay on the ground and not float?
22535,bfThiqDd9FA,@@mohy3396 You can never win an argument against an idiot
22536,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 Until you can provide any proof that can’t be debunked nobody will ever believe you.
22537,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid i dont care. At least i know the truth.
22538,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid in case you dont get it ill explain somthing for you. I dont need your valadation or any one elses.
22539,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 if you don’t care then don’t try to prove it to others. Which as I can clearly so you tried to in the replies
22540,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid who said i was trying to prove it. It speaks for it self. I was seeing who eles was listening.
22541,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 clearly it doesn’t if it’s really easy to disprove
22542,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid well is it realy that easly to disprove or is it a matter of prospective. Sometimes people cant see the forest for all the trees. All the trees being all the lies they have been told.
22543,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 And yet you can’t prove that they’re lies
22544,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid dont have to. Water tells the story. Water doesnt lie.
22545,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 that doesn’t mean anything
22546,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid i know it doesnt to people who cant see. Im awhere of that
22547,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 What you said had no meaning. “The water doesn’t lie”. You said that completely out of context without explaining anything. Also I won’t trust anyone who claims others can’t “see” when they can’t spell aware correctly
22548,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid what ever have fun in your make beleive world.
22549,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 you have failed to provide any proof. Man I think you are in denial

22552,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 when it’s propelled it can. You realize water isn’t just dumped into the pipes, it’s actively propelled. Also, gravity applies to water the same way it applies to humans. If I roll down a hill in let’s say china I won’t have issues rolling down it because its on the other side of the world."
22553,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Tweedle-Stupid no realy it cant be. Remeber just because science says it can. Because scince has an intrest into keeping people decieved.
22554,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gregyork7527 I think you are deceiving yourself. Considering this can be tested very easily
22555,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@Tweedle-Stupid by who's standards and measurements.
Have you personally tested it."
22556,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@gregyork7527 does it matter? No matter if I personally measured it you wouldn’t care. I could send all the proof you would say it’s faked. 

Whenever you reply it sends me over the moon. Because even if I get my facts wrong, I still know I’m the correct one here."

22572,bfThiqDd9FA,How is the moon close even tho its geting far from the earth each year
22573,bfThiqDd9FA,Is that why the face of the moon is the same direction but there then your little asteroid there came in from the right and the left of a moon that only faces earth one way?
22574,bfThiqDd9FA,Area
22575,bfThiqDd9FA,"I’m not sure you would see much of anything regardless of the size of this impact. It would reflect the suns light much less than the solid moons surface that’s for sure, and would appear opaque to a degree. It would disperse very very slowly, and form much more slowly. It also unless centered in a deep canyons or steep crater would have a ploom originating from the site of impact, which we don’t see here. It’s offset by a pretty vast distance down the moons circumference. Very rookie mistake there. 

And Finally, I doubt you would see shading within the ploom, again because it would be so faint, and so slow to form the shape needed. It certainly wouldn’t be on par with the gradient contrasts seen in the moons craters like it is here. And the overall ploom itself would not correlate to what we see on earth based impacts and explosions. Remember the gravity it much different, the atmosphere almost non existent. All would allow for a radically different look of the debris kick up."
22576,bfThiqDd9FA,It IS amazing how it defied all of that logic. I wonder how that happened...amazing!
22577,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@steved6511 it's more of an advice, I guess"
22578,bfThiqDd9FA,"Your entire logic is built on the notion that it would be faint, something that is not slightly true for multiple reasons.  Not defending this nonsensical video in the slightest just pointing out you are completely incorrect for multiple reasons.  Very important reason is directly under the moons surface is an extremely bright white layer of dust."

22692,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao. Nice editing. Did you learn how to do that on the back of a cereal box?
22693,bfThiqDd9FA,"I was loathed to click, but click I did!!  43 secs I will never get back"
22694,bfThiqDd9FA,Was the other location the dark side of the moon? 😆
22695,bfThiqDd9FA,and you still think google is right about the distance to the moon
22696,bfThiqDd9FA,No just no and you wouldn’t see the rocket either because it’s so small compared to the moon you would not see it
22697,bfThiqDd9FA,Thats just goku in his pod
22698,bfThiqDd9FA,This is super science right here!  Wow!  Many great!
22699,bfThiqDd9FA,"The Man on the Moon, smokes a vape"
22700,bfThiqDd9FA,Que mentira
22701,bfThiqDd9FA,Lmao amazing how the cloud moves exactly like it's in an atmosphere then just dissipates as if it never existed. The debris from impact of that magnitude would be visible for YEARS.
22702,bfThiqDd9FA,"And chunks of the moon would probably hit here though, not too long afterward.... Moreover, impacts in void (of atmosphere) space do not create mushroom clouds EVER."
22703,bfThiqDd9FA,"I’m not sure about years for an impact this size. Maybe as a giant aura around the moon on a clear night. But this was a relatively small impact (as depicted). There’s no atmosphere to slow and contain the particles, and less gravity than earth to cling to it with."
22704,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@He.Who.Shall.Remain.Genderless Exactly What I Was Thinking,and 3 Days Later,If You Didnt Know..You Wouldnt Know This Event(If Thats What It Is) Ever Took Place..The Moon Isnt In Deep Space and We Wouldnt Be Viewing Like a Remnant Nebula From Supernova’s For Years..Crash Site.Good Day Or So,Besides a New Crater."
22705,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@chillylizerd ,Maybe Go Read The Description..This Happened"
22706,bfThiqDd9FA,@@PafMedic yes because if you lie in the description the algorithm won't allow you to post it.
22707,bfThiqDd9FA,"Besides anything moving that fast (the ""meteor"") would have made the moon feel a catastrophe if it was that huge. 😂"
22708,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@PafMedic it did happen, but the rocket is too small to even be visible on earth"
22709,bfThiqDd9FA,@@He.Who.Shall.Remain.Genderless the cloud would literally be as high as half of North America is wide. At the speed it appeared it would have ejecta that would fall into eccentric orbits around both the moon and the earth. the visible debris would linger for a decade. The stable debris would give the moon a ring. It would be a historic and monumental event that would leave its mark in every history book and be studied and observed the world over for the next century.
22710,bfThiqDd9FA,@@fuckgoogletheyreshit2661 Les be honest… despite the other implications… A ringed moon would be badass.
22711,bfThiqDd9FA,Correct me if I’m wrong but I do not think the moon is that clear in the day time🤣
22712,bfThiqDd9FA,i love how the dust cloud has like 20 fps less than the rest of the video. must've been an insane crash man.
22713,bfThiqDd9FA,"exactly,

i also love that alleged dust shows convection moves which are possible only in atmospheric environment.

similar crash would produce dust particles traveling in a parabolic trajectories... -_-

edit: also it dissolves into nothing just like pure magic xd"
22714,bfThiqDd9FA,@@andrzejbozek Wow 100000000 iq
22715,bfThiqDd9FA,The simulation couldn't keep up /s
22716,bfThiqDd9FA,@@andrzejbozek so your an expert? We just saw what happened it was fascinating

Oh and here's one more: the ""plume"" that the ""impact"" is shown to create is convective, which only works in an atmosphere, which the Moon is famous for not having. Nothing is right about this video :D"

22766,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@ExclusivZoneGames howbolporque why, may you express pls...."
22767,bfThiqDd9FA,Right?! Those clouds were also crazy thic to just block it out for a second.
22768,bfThiqDd9FA,@@intunewithdainfinte4781 so what's outside of the firmament? Somebody's office desk? What's the firmament resting on? A table? A table resting on a globe? Is the firmament actually a Dyson sphere?
22769,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@andrzejbozek I was going to say the same thing. You'd get more like a dome shape to it, and then it would drop back to the surface."
22770,bfThiqDd9FA,Simon did not hold the space bar
22771,bfThiqDd9FA,Well that explains what I heard and felt  the other day.
22772,bfThiqDd9FA,Ofcoursefake. De speed the explosion comes out of the moon is like a barbiehouse quality.
22773,bfThiqDd9FA,Lack of oxygen would make it hard for the dust and debris to push through the moons orbit

22777,bfThiqDd9FA,@@oliverhart7013 R/woosh its a joke
22778,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Beowulf_93I believe it's because there is less gravity on the moon? Dust and surface debris could be hurled faster and at higher altitudes form the moon's surface.
22779,bfThiqDd9FA,Right. Probably lagged the whole server like fallout 76.
22780,bfThiqDd9FA,😂😂🤣🤣

22783,bfThiqDd9FA,@@ExclusivZoneGames 💀
22784,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon is just laggy. When you fly to the moon the frame rate drops.
22785,bfThiqDd9FA,Bottleneck 😂
22786,bfThiqDd9FA,"Excellent observation my friend , dustcover would be slower upon impact.  Special effects.  Moon was spinning to fast in its rotation."
22787,bfThiqDd9FA,I like how the cloud maintains shape after being launched 100s of miles into space
22788,bfThiqDd9FA,@@godbless1187 shut up 🙄
22789,bfThiqDd9FA,HAHA SO SMART
22790,bfThiqDd9FA,Well obviously it’s so far away that the matrix saves on recourses by rendering it on lower FPS.

22803,bfThiqDd9FA,the speed of light takes about less than a second to go from the earth to the moon so it makes sense you see it in frames

23098,bfThiqDd9FA,March 4th 2022 was a waxing crescent moon. This is a waxing/waining gibbous. Ignore the fact we couldn't see it that alone shows is BS
23099,bfThiqDd9FA,"Also the Moon lacking an atmosphere, you wouldn't get a mushroom cloud."
23100,bfThiqDd9FA,Right! Finally someone who states that. To be accurate video at least should match the exact moon phase of that day.
23101,bfThiqDd9FA,impossible!!
23102,bfThiqDd9FA,Looked like the moon farted
23103,bfThiqDd9FA,GREAT effects ! But the blast wasn’t big enough to be seen by the naked eye. If they made a blast that big that we could see it..? It would have damaging effects to Earth… the radiation atoms from something that big would be unlike anything ever tested on Earth. They’d NEVER let a blast like that go off on Earth… haha! You never know though right? Crazy leaders with atom bombs…
23104,bfThiqDd9FA,Fantastic editing
23105,bfThiqDd9FA,"I think it's pretty bad. The stuff ejected from the impact would be more of a spherical shape than a mushroom cloud, as there is no atmosphere pushing against it to make it that shape, not to mention how low fps the asset they used is."

23123,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@zaxck1365 apparently you are so I'll just have to spell it out for you, smoke is any form of particle clashing against light, literally all forms of element can cause ""smoke""
This makes all forms of mineral and gases a form of ""smoke"" with the most common type of smoke being carbon dioxide/monoxide. The f*cking sun is made primarily out of gases, being mostly hydrogen.
ON TOP of all that there is nothing saying that there is no air in space, the vastness of space just takes whatever air was there and spreads it everywhere, so instead of a concentration of gases like we have on Earth because of our atmosphere, the gas is spread out to so little it's about as small as an electron.
The idea "" smoke can't exist because there's no air"" is stupid being belief
Maybe you should learn what smoke is before you say something that dumb 🗿💀"
23124,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@zaxck1365 and we can see if from this far because light is a type of ultraviolet ray, that does not need any medium for said light to travel through.

23125,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@mace6058 I also want to say that you are completely right, the ""moon dust"" was pulled back toward the moon because of the gravity, it turning to ice is questionable though because we don't know the specifics of the moon, but whether or not it froze it's still a valid point"

Now, find the angle from where the object came into view and the moon. That will give you the distance it traveled within that short period of time. It would have been going MILLIONS of miles per hour to do that. Also, there is a smoke cloud? Really? hmmm. And then the cloud dissipates afterwards like a cloud on earth. Hmmm. This is a fake video.

23165,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@foulasign 😁 I assumed everyone was joking....🤔....but now I'm wondering.  Seriously though, at this point, nothing surprises me anymore."
23166,bfThiqDd9FA,@@gdbravewebbrowser5156 yeah but he also doubled on the negative. comical af.
23167,bfThiqDd9FA,Moon smoking indo
23168,bfThiqDd9FA,Wair
23169,bfThiqDd9FA,Hold on…. It crashed on the dark side of the moon and at 4:25 am. Where were you that it’s that light out at 4:25am and the dark side of the moon is lit for the first time ever 😂
23170,bfThiqDd9FA,it was 7:25am EST
23171,bfThiqDd9FA,time zones
23172,bfThiqDd9FA,And also it says that the crash was not apparent to the naked eye
23173,bfThiqDd9FA,"There is no ""dark side of the moon"" (except for a Pink Floyd album).  The far side of the moon that we don't see gets the same amount of light as the side facing Earth."
23174,bfThiqDd9FA,@@chrishebert5672 is dark cos we no see it
23175,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@megajimmyfive That defines hidden, not ""dark"".  It gets just as much sun as the side facing us."
23176,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@chrishebert5672 look up the definition of dark, the 4th defined meaning of it in particular. The word dark is also used to describe things that humans have little knowledge about. For example the dark ages are called the dark ages because there are very few texts from the period, meaning we don't know much about it"
23177,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@megajimmyfive I think that in the case of the moon, most people use ""dark"" as in it doesn't get any sunlight."
23178,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@chrishebert5672 The original meaning was simply that it was ""dark"" to us."
23179,bfThiqDd9FA,"Thats one giant ass rocket everyone could see 240,000 miles aways with the naked eye 😂😂"
23180,bfThiqDd9FA,That is what I say also. A rocket the size of Texas? Yea we believe this video. You gotta admit. They did put a lot of work into it though. But they did not do the math and that is where they messed up.
23181,bfThiqDd9FA,@@Jack_rabbits_sage_brush no
23182,bfThiqDd9FA,"Exactly, even the moon look so close to the Earth"
23183,bfThiqDd9FA,and travelling a significant fraction of the speed of light to say nothing of credulity :D
23184,bfThiqDd9FA,The ejected moon dust had to be speeding at 4 or 5 times the speed of the object- Hilarious.
23185,bfThiqDd9FA,"Has anyone noticed how the cloud wasn’t even touching the moon!? And in end of vid just magically disappears!!! SEE I TOLD YA, MAGIC DOES EXIST!!!"
23186,bfThiqDd9FA,The moon is 3000 miles away
23187,bfThiqDd9FA,"For a 'ploom/muchroom cloud' ☁️ effect to occur, it has to be debree/gas burrowing through a layer of already existing atmosphere (the moon doesn't have), rising over ( like bubbles in a water tank). The impact also would be a scatter blast shardes of debree, starting with a spark impact, that would've been visible of such size and speed. So now, a very visible evidence  of impact should be on the moon."
23188,bfThiqDd9FA,@@frankieangelo413 there are high zoom cameras with video ability but that's not the point. The whole incident is edited.

23201,bfThiqDd9FA,@Shark Playz he meant that the sound did not match up with the explosion
23202,bfThiqDd9FA,@Shark Playz sound cant travel trough space
23203,bfThiqDd9FA,"Because he's still learning special effects and hasn't quite mastered it yet.  Or it was simply a crappy phone app. 
You're welcome."
23204,bfThiqDd9FA,"@@axot107 no, no, no, the comment meant the explosion frame rate is lower than the video. Take a look again, watch the frame rate difference between the clouds and the explosion."

23225,9ItvwqiehD0,I HATE clickbait titles.  8 minutes and I still don’t know how the satellites are deployed.  👎
23226,9ItvwqiehD0,So they will become militarized
23227,9ItvwqiehD0,But if the weather is bad so will be your internet
23228,9ItvwqiehD0,Satellites should be built with a self destruct feature that destroys said satellite
23229,9ItvwqiehD0,That's the go lol trash the earth then start trashing the sky's lol
23230,9ItvwqiehD0,Terrible title    Wasted 9 minutes
23231,9ItvwqiehD0,The title is misleading. The video did not talk about How Starlink Satellites Are Deployed. Therefore it earned a dislike.
23232,9ItvwqiehD0,actually it's superb to watch satellites cross the night sky when looking at the stars.
23233,9ItvwqiehD0,Can you say Balloons?
23234,9ItvwqiehD0,I have seen one of these  satellite trains I flew over head and starting glitching in and out one second ist there the next it fades out. Comes back on and so on for a bit then just disappears. Did not look real at all it looked like a halo Gram glitching in and out. 9 lights in the sky with one brighter light out front. Fakest shit I have seen in a while

23242,9ItvwqiehD0,"Starlink has generated significant interest and excitement in the tech and internet connectivity communities. Its promise of providing high-speed internet access to remote and underserved areas is seen as a potential game-changer, especially for regions with limited access to traditional broadband options. Is it TRUE?"
23243,9ItvwqiehD0,"Yes, I’m finally being able to communicate with my family who lives in the middle of the Amazon jungle and couldn’t have internet until they installed Starlink last week. He is also putting free internet for in many public schools so people can have access to knowledge by the river in the Amazon."

What an absolute MESS!... 🙄"
23277,9ItvwqiehD0,"Firstly. You wont be able to see thousands of moving dots everywhere. The satellites are small compared to the amount of space in space, you can also only really spot the satellites when they are released into orbit, they tumble / rotate initially to spread them apart, this causes light to reflect off them in all kinds of directions but it is only temporary, once positioned and in the correct orientation their black underside makes them completely invisible to the naked eye
Secondly, the satellites dishes or antenna arrays used by starlink are So small compared to satellites used in the past. You think in the future houses will be ugly because of satelite dishes?? Seriously? Ever heard of satelite tv? It's a thing and it has existed for years. You have probably seen tons of satelite dishes in your lifetime but never paid them any attention.."

23284,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@_A4A There is no such thing as analog internet. Everybodies connection to it is digital. Even when people were using dial up connections. Modems modulated the digital signals so they could be carried by an analog line, it was still digital data.

Define ridiculously sized? Have you actually seen the size of the dishes used by Starlink? I think you may be imaging the older dishes people used back in the 1970s and 1980s that used C band for analog sat TV and were commonly referred to as BUDs (Big Ugly Dishes). Starlink dishes are smaller than even many of the Ku band dishes used for the digital sat TV services like Dish Network and Direct TV. Do you currently complain about all the existing antennas everywhere? You are surrounded by them if you pay attention. Shortwave broadcast, AM and FM broadcast, TV broadcast, emergency service repeaters, ham radio antennas including repeater towers, cell phone transceiver towers, TV Shortwave AM and FM reception antennas, private radio network antennas for companies communicating with and tracking vehicles, wifi antennas, and more both large and small. 

Yes, there are a lot of studies on problems with space debris orbiting the Earth but none of that applies in the long term to anything considered to be in Low Earth Orbit. Anything in that region still experiences drag from the outer edges of the atmosphere and without thrusters reboosting to gain altitude it will slowly encounter more and more drag, slow down, fully reenter the atmosphere, and burn up during reentry. So even if the entire company were to vanish overnight the sat would eventually quite literally fall out of the sky and destroy themselves rather than remaining in orbit and becoming navigational hazards. To put it in perspective the ISS orbits at an altitude of 254 miles above the surface while Starlink sats only orbit at max altitude of 350 miles. If one completely fails the estimate is it would deorbit in around 5 years. In other words. They are by design using an orbit where if nobody keeps telling them to use their thrusters occasionally to maintain altitude they will self destruct and leave nothing behind to be a problem for anybody."
23285,9ItvwqiehD0,They can dim the brightness of their satellites
23286,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@rissyrizz That is untrue  and we all know it.  But I will give you an ""E"" for effort!...."
23287,9ItvwqiehD0,"@@hackerx7329 I appreciate you for taking the time and thoroughness to explain in detail about the satellites and their functions thereof.  Also the different scenarios and examples of what could or should happen.  I also appreciate you for pointing out different factors as well.  I'm still not a big fan of Man filling up our worlds orbit with potential hazards as some things have reentered our atmosphere and did not fully burn up, as China has twice now been called out for and luckily that debris landed in the indian ocean, but had the whole world on notice.

Nonetheless, I do hope for a better & safer world for us younger generations that are still growing up, going to start our own family's and so on, and what world we leave behind.  I had to laugh at the acronym ""BUD"" because my Grandfather had one of those and so did a lot of his neighbors and they are Butt Ugly Dishes and he was always having issues with it. 🤣
