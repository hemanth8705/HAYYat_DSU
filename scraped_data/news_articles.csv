0,BJP made farmers ‘urjadata’: Nitin Gadkari,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bjp-made-farmers-urjadata-nitin-gadkari/,"Amid the ongoing tussle between the farmers and the BJP, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said earlier farmers were called ‘annadata’ only, now the BJP government had made them ‘urjadata’ too. As the paddy harvest has started, he called upon the farmers not to burn the stubble. “I observed paddy stubble being burnt, and I request the farmers not to burn it as there are technologies and plants to prepare CNG and LNG from stubble. Earlier, we used to call farmers ‘annadata’, but our government has made farmers ‘urjadata’ too.” Flex-fuel engine vehicles are coming and ethanol pumps are being opened in the country, it will increase the income of farmers. Hydrogen is the future and trust me farmers will produce hydrogen. Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister Gadkari addressed gatherings in support of party candidates Subhash Sudha in Thanesar and Nayab Singh Saini in Ladwa. Keeping his focus on farmers, he said: “Diversification of agriculture towards energy and power sector is the need of this country if we want to develop smart villages and ensure welfare of farmers and labourers. We are working with the aim to eliminate pollution, develop villages and generate employment. All such things are happening because there is a right government with right policies in the centre.” He said “After Independence, the Congress ruled this country for 60-65 years but failed to develop the nation, and people started leaving villages. Farmers committed suicide, and they were not given the priority. But the BJP introduced various welfare policies for farmers.” He also highlighted the various ongoing and upcoming projects in Haryana and said “Haryana is transforming at a rapid pace. We are carrying out projects worth around Rs 2 lakh crore. I know Kurukshetra needs a ring road, and before this election, I approved this project.” He said he would also consider the demand for the Ladwa bypass, which has been a major poll issue here. “This election will not determine the future of Congress and BJP, but it will decide the future of the people of Haryana. To develop Haryana, make farmers prosperous, and end corruption, I request you to vote for the BJP,” he said.

1,BJP gave priority to infrastructure under Modi govt: Nitin Gadkari,https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=1229943,"Gurugram, Sep 26 (IANS): Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said that the BJP gave priority to the infrastructure under the Modi government. The Union Minister campaigned for BJP Gurgaon candidate Mukesh Sharma in Gurugram district on Wednesday and sought votes for his party candidates in the upcoming Haryana state assembly elections. “BJP gave priority to infrastructure and the country has witnessed rapid development in the last 10 years of the Narendra Modi government and a network of roads has been laid across Haryana,” the Union Minister said while addressing a public gathering in support of BJP candidate at Ram Lilla ground in Bhim Nagar area. Gadkari while attacking the opposition said: ""The Congress party failed to do anything in the past 65 years what we have done in 10 years under the leadership of PM Modi. Our representatives have worked in your area. In Haryana alone, work worth more than Rs 2 lakh crore has been done by my ministry.” He said this election will decide the fate of Haryana and the people of Gurugram. ""Two things are important for the development of a country — an honest leader and a right policy — and both of these are there in the BJP. Therefore, you should strengthen the state by making BJP victorious and speed up the development of Haryana,” said Gadkari. He said if the BJP retains power in Haryana will touch new dimensions of development. Union Minister and BJP’s Gurgaon Lok Sabha candidate Rao Inderjit Singh, party candidate from the Gurgaon Assembly constituency Mukesh Sharma and other party leaders were also present at the gathering. Gadkari further said several flyover works are underway on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway, Pataudi Road worth crores of rupees. He said that other major projects like the Delhi-Pune Expressway, Ambala-Shamali Expressway, and Delhi-Dehradun Expressway are in full swing and these projects will be operational by 2025. “I have been a Union Minister in the BJP government for 10 years. We have seen that Gadkari is such a minister who does what he says. A network of roads has been laid in Haryana and the country. People’s travel has become easier and only this is the development agenda of the Modi government,” Rao Inderjit Singh said. Haryana will go to polls in a single phase on October 5.  Heavy tollgate fees and heavy GST imposed on citizens. Citizens wallets are squeezed at the most.  Poor quality of work shown in the Infrastructure.  Roads damaged, Bridges collapsed, drains overflowed etc.  Some people making money and no quality, no progress.

Union minister and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari has frowned upon the use of caste in politics and said that politicians who can‚Äôt win elections on the basis of their work talk about it. Gadkari was speaking to News18 India at the ‚ÄòChaupal‚Äô conclave on Monday evening. Stating that it is the BJP‚Äôs commitment to ensure social and economic equality in India, Gadkari said the BJP or the RSS never discuss policies and ideas on the basis of caste, community or religion. He further. lamented that backwardness had become an issue of political interest. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, there is a competition among everyone to prove that he is backward‚Ä¶Our problem today is not caste and community ‚Äì it is poverty, hunger and unemployment. How we can serve the poor, farmers, those living in villages, the marginalised on the basis of good governance and the right policies are what BJP works on,‚Äù said Gadkari, who handles the Union Road Transport and Highways portfolio. Asked if there was merit in the Opposition‚Äôs demand for a caste census, Gadkari chose to steer clear of the question of whether such an exercise should be taken up or not. He did, however, put forth an argument. ‚ÄúHas any caste-based leader done anything good for people of his community? When it comes to giving poll tickets, they says ‚Äògive a ticket to my wife, my son, daughter, uncle, driver‚Ä¶ What sort of upliftment is this?‚Äù Gadkari wondered, adding that there are ample examples of people whom we see as icons in society who have never done this. Gadkari then claimed that political leaders who cannot win elections based on their work seek votes on the basis of caste. ‚ÄúLeaders who are incapable of winning elections based on their work are the ones who seek votes in the name of caste.‚Äù The minister further added that the backward communities ‚Äì socially or economically ‚Äì will continue to get reservations as per their constitutional right. The minister also said during his interaction that he has never aspired to become the Prime Minister of the country. The comments came days after Gadkari said a senior Opposition leader had approached him with an offer to back his candidacy for the prime ministerial post ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari claimed that he turned down the offer, citing his unwavering commitment to his party and its ideology.

(PTI file photo) Union Minister and prominent BJP leader Nitin Gadkari revealed on Saturday that he turned down an offer for the Prime Minister’s position from a senior opposition leader ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari made this revelation during a journalism award ceremony at the Nagpur Press Club. Speaking at the event, he noted that he firmly rejected the offer, stating, “I told the leader that I am guided by a particular ideology and firm beliefs. I am part of a party that has given me everything I could have ever dreamed of. No offer can tempt me.” While Gadkari did not provide specific details about the incident or name the opposition leader, he stated that the offer was made in the context of speculation that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) might not secure a full majority in the 2024 general elections and could need support from opposition parties. During the same event, Gadkari slammed so-called “supari journalists” who misuse the Right to Information (RTI) Act for blackmail and personal gain, Hindustan Times reported. Recounting a past incident, he described a situation where a journalist allegedly used RTI to blackmail officials in the Public Works Department (PWD). “One of my officers informed me about this blackmail. I told him, ‘what that journalist comes to your office, lock the door and give him a good thrashing.’ And they did. After that, the publication he worked for stopped circulating,” he disclosed. Expressing concern about such “unethical practices”, the Union Minister urged media organisations to exercise greater caution when issuing authority cards. Despite these issues, Gadkari acknowledged that many journalists continue to uphold ethical standards. He highlighted examples of journalists who, even during the Emergency, remained steadfast in their principles and refused to compromise, even when faced with imprisonment."

I’m just another worker of the party helping with his vision. The idea of me being Prime Minister doesn’t come up. I’m not aiming to be PM and I don’t have that dream,” Gadkari said in March 2019.

However, Gadkari did not hold back his criticism of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway’s upkeep, stating, “I have used the Eastern Peripheral Expressway after a long time. A lot of work has been done. Now I wish that a lot of people who don’t work retire, some contractors get blacklisted and bank guarantees of some are forfeited.” “The office bearers of associations are sitting here (in the audience at the event), the roads should be well-maintained. I saw the road today, it’s very poorly maintained. We will not spare you. We’ll ensure that bank guarantees of those doing bad work are forfeited and after this, we will blacklist you, not allow you to apply for new tenders,” Gadkari warned. On the other hand, Gadkari mentioned that the government will grant special recognition to agencies and operators that maintain roads effectively. “Those who do good will be awarded while those who do bad will be driven out of the system,” the minister added. The EPS is a retirement scheme for organized sector employees retiring at 58, requiring 10 years of work. Both employer and employee contribute 12% of basic salary, with employee’s share going to EPF and employer’s divided between EPF and EPS. 7 types of pension offered, such as retirement, early, disability, and widow/child pension."

There are two types of politics - politics of convenience and politics of conviction. After seeing Emergency in 1975, I have been doing the politics of conviction, so this kind of thought never came to my mind. My partyâ€™s decisions are supreme for me,â€ť Gadkari said at the News18 Chaupal event on September 16. The comments come days after Gadkari said a senior politician from the opposition had approached him with an offer to back his candidacy for the prime ministerial post ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, Gadkari revealed that he turned down the offer, citing his unwavering commitment to his party and its ideology. Meanwhile, Gadkari said he is hopeful BJP will win upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, and he will make up for lost seats. While commenting on religion being used in politics, Gadkari said politicians who can't win elections based on their work talk about religion. The minister also said he doesn't think there is discrimination against Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.

""I remember one incident -- I would not name anyone -- that person said 'if you are going to become prime minister, we will support you,"" Gadkari said at a journalism awards function in Nagpur, according to PTI. Gadkari didn't elaborate on the details about the incident or the name of the opposition leader. However, he said that the offer was made amid speculations that the BJP might not secure a full majority in the Lok Sabha polls.  ""But, I asked why you should support me, and why should I take your support. To become the prime minister is not the aim in my life. I am loyal to my conviction and my organisation, and I am not going to compromise for any post because my conviction is foremost for me,"" the union minister said. During his speech, the BJP veteran underlined the importance of ethics in both journalism and politics. He slammed the so-called “supari journalists” who misuse the Right to Information Act for blackmail and personal gains. He went on to say how some journalists used unethical means to acquire luxury items, including Mercedes cars, according to a report in Hindustan Times. During the event, the minister recalled a meeting with a senior CPI functionary and said he told the communist leader that late A.B. Bardhan was among the tallest politicians from Nagpur and Vidarbha. When the leader expressed surprise saying that Bardhan was an opponent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Gadkari said honest opposition should be respected. ""I said one should respect a person who opposes with honesty, because there is honesty in his opposition....one who opposes with dishonesty deserves no respect, said Gadkari.Comrade Bardhan was faithful to his ideology, and politics as well as journalism now lack such people,"" he said. Democracy will be successful only when all four pillars --  judiciary, executive, legislature and media -- follow ethics, he added."

In India, there is no problem of difference of opinion but “there is a problem of lack of opinion”, he said. “We are neither rightist, nor leftist. We are opportunists. It is expected from writers and intellectuals that they express their opinions without any fear,” he added. Gadkari also said that as long as untouchability and notions of social inferiority and superiority persist, the work of nation-building can not be said to be complete.

(File image) A proposed 14-lane road near the Atal Setu sea bridge that will connect to Pune via a ring road will bring down traffic on Mumbai-Pune Expressway by 50 per cent, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Sunday. The Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways was talking about road plans for Mumbai-Bengaluru at an alumni event organised by COEP Technological University on the occasion of Engineer’s Day. “There is huge traffic on Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A 14-lane road will be built near Atal Setu, which will further connect to Pune via a ring road and then onwards to Bengaluru. This road will bring down traffic on Mumbai-Pune Expressway by 50 per cent,” he said. The Atal Setu is the country’s longest sea bridge and connects Sewri in Mumbai to Navi Mumbai. Speaking at the event, Gadkari said India was ranked third in the world in the automobile sector and in the next 25 years all vehicles will run on electricity and not fossil fuels. “Our technology should be economical. We can use garbage to make roads. Around 80 lakh tonnes of garbage has been used to build new roads. There is huge scope for researchers in this sector,” Gadkari asserted. Stressing on the Centre’s Atmanirbhar (self reliance) concept, he said India needs “smart villages” rather than smart cities. “The standard of living of farmers should improve. Only then we can call them atmanirbhar,” he pointed out."

Gadkari, a senior BJP leader, also encouraged writers and intellectuals to express their thoughts freely and fearlessly. “It is expected from literary figures, intellectuals, and poets that they openly and strongly share their views and opinions,” he added. He noted that the real issue in today’s discourse is not disagreement but a lack of diverse opinions. “We are neither right-wing nor left-wing; we are opportunists. Writers and intellectuals should express their opinions without fear,” he said. Gadkari further highlighted that the nation-building process remains incomplete as long as social issues like untouchability and notions of inferiority or superiority persist. Speaking at the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) during an Engineers’ Day event, Gadkari also stressed the importance of transparency and timely decision-making. He questioned the value of laws if people fail to understand their spirit and purpose. “There is a difference between letter and spirit. If a knowledgeable person does not understand the intent behind a law, then what is the use? Sometimes, even to fill potholes, one needs a boss’s order. At other times, when funds are available, work begins immediately. There is a need for transparency and a time-bound decision-making process,” Gadkari concluded.

However, the minister, without mincing words, expressed unhappiness over the upkeep of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and rebuked the agencies and contractors concerned. ""I have used the Eastern Peripheral Expressway after a long time. A lot of work has been done. Now I wish that a lot of people who don't work retire, some contractors get blacklisted and bank guarantees of some are forfeited,"" Mr Gadkari said.

Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on September 9 said that a large Indian carmaker didn't take him seriously when he was pushing for developing more electric vehicles ingeniously in the past and now they may have missed the bus. ""A good friend of mine who is a giant in the automobile industry... I kept telling him to adopt electric vehicles, but he never made the decision,"" Gadkari said. ""Now, my friend tells me (that) back then we didn't take you seriously cause our experience related to politicians was not very credible."" The road minister added that he is confidant now that theÂ company has missed the bus.Â Gadkari was speaking at the 64th Annual Session of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA). He stressed that automobile companies that are willing to adopt the best technology in the world, which isÂ cost-saving and helps reduce pollution at a reasonable cost, will have a good future in the industry. While the road minister did not name Maruti Suzuki directly, his comments painted quite a clear picture. ""Those companies that currently have good sales, a good market cap, but don't want to change... I wish them all the best. I think they will face issues in the future,"" Gadkari said. The minister's comments come at a time when India's largest carmaker is doubling down on its stance on hybrid vehicles, insisting that strong hybrids should be considered as a replacement for petrol and diesel models, and not as a competitor to electric vehicles. Last month, in its annual report for 2023-24, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava had underscored the potential of a supportive policy framework in significantly reducing the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles, thereby curbing emissions. He pointed out that given Indiaâ€™s abundant resources and unique socio-economic conditions, a multifaceted approach is the most effective way forward. Maruti Suzuki plans to introduce electric cars soon, encouraging the adoption of strong hybrid technology, CNG, ethanol, and biogas vehicles. Bhargava emphasised the importance of renewable biogas, which has no import content and is carbon-negative. The company has started a trial of biogas production and hopes that government policies will support this development. The country's largest carmaker, which has historically made vehicles for the masses, is often questioned for not launching a fully electric vehicles till now, when the country records a sale of 6,338 electric vehicles in August 2024, and 1.5 million in 2023, at a 50 percent surge year-on-year. The overall share of EVs in India's auto sales has risen sharply to 6.38 percent in 2023 from 1.75 percent in 2021, reflecting a growing consumer preference for electric vehicles over a two-year period. Not only is Maruti Suzuki one of the few mass-market carmakers in India to offer a hybrid option, the brand is set to expand its petrol-electric portfolio, starting next year. ""The debate is not between EV and strong hybrid. Both are excellent technologies. Both need to be encouraged. The debate is between strong hybrids and IC engines. I cannot imagine a situation, and nobody can justify why IC engines should be preferred over strong hybrids,â€ť Maruti Suzukiâ€™s executive director, corporate affairs, Rahul Bharti, had insisted in June. He added that a recent report by a think tank, claiming that hybrids do not reduce emissions and that strong hybrids are mostly used in pure petrol mode, was factually incorrect. ""In a strong hybrid electric vehicle, it is the computer that optimises both drivetrains, the IC engine and the battery motor combination, and there is no option given to the driver to run in pure ICE mode,"" Bharti said. The executive director has also said that Marutiâ€™s Grand Vitara and Invicto hybrids produce 26 percent and 30 percent lower CO2, while increasing fuel-efficiency by 36 percent and 46 percent, compared to their petrol counterparts. â€śSo, definitely strong hybrids are a very powerful way to cut oil imports, generate energy efficiency, and reduce CO2 immediately without the pressure of range anxiety or lack of charging infrastructure,â€ť Bharti insisted. Maruti Suzuki's comments come at an important interjection for the electric vehicles industry in India, when the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme has been discontinued and electric passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales have declined for four months in a row.

Government is keen on a gas-based economy and wants car and commercial vehicle makers to increasingly adopt technologies that are based on alternative fuels, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said, made a strong case for use of greener fuels in India. Addressing the automotive industry at SIAM's annual convention, Minister Gadkari said by building technology in alternate fuels, Indian automakers can capture the world market in this space. The said the Government has been pushing for greater availability of bio-fuels in India, and has ramped up CNG fuel stations from 750 in 2014 to 6,000 as of today. This will be ramped up to a 6,000 by 2030, said Nitin Gadkari. ""The government is keen to have a gas economy in India, since it is more cost effective and less polluting,"" he added. Even methanol-blended diesel has been successfully implemented in some commericial vehicles by Ashok Leyland, which can now run on up to 15% methanol mixed in diesel. Minister Gadkari also asked truck makers to ramp up the manufacturing of liquefied natural gas based trucks.Â ""Will appeal truck makers to use ethanol, methanol, LNG and CNG."" Some reports have indicated that the Centre is keen to have as much as a third of its long-haul trucks fuelled by LNG, instead of diesel in five to seven years. A draft policy in this regard has been in the works at the Petroleum Ministry, which plans to allocate 0.5 million cubic metres of gas per day of LNG to meet the requirements of about 50,000 trucks for two-to-three years. ""In a gas economy compared to diesel, there is economic sense and saving. In single fill, LNG-powered trucks can go up to to 1400 km, and can result in a saving of Rs 12 lakh per year in fuel costs,"" Nitin Gadkari told car makers.

25,Nitin Gadkari raises alarm over road safety,https://pragativadi.com/nitin-gadkari-raises-alarm-over-road-safety/,"New Delhi: India leads the list of countries with the maximum number of road accidents and consequent deaths in the world. And while the Indian automobile industry has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, Nitin Gadkari has chosen yet again to also point at measures that can make roads here safer for motorists as well as pedestirians. Speaking at the 64th annual conference of Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers in New Delhi on Tuesday, the Union Minister for Road Transportation and Highways urged all stakeholders to also concentrate efforts to bring down instances of accidents. Gadkari has time and again stressed on the need to have safer roads for all in the country. On Tuesday, he also urged manufacturers to establish driving schools to ensure that those in control of automobiles are aware of local rules and regulations, as well as skilled to be driving or riding vehicles. “There are nearly 53 accidents and 18 deaths every hour in our country. Just imagine. 45 per cent of accidents because of two-wheelers, 20 per cent in pedestrians,” he pointed out before urging OEMs to also contribute towards bringing these numbers down. “I really request you all to take interest in starting driver-training schools. Then we can train good drivers and it can be a really positive solution.” Gadkari, while also admitting that his department has started working on faulty road constructions and signage, further underlined the need for safer vehicles and highlighted the importance of Bharat NCAP. “Bharat NCAP will ensure healthy competition between manufacturers to have safer vehicles for customers.” New Delhi: OpenAI, the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence firm, is once again drawing attention due to major...

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) will award road contracts worth Rs 3 lakh crore in 2024-25 despite a slow start in the current financial year so far, union minister Nitin Gadkari said on September 16. ŌĆ£Because of the election and the model code of conduct, the speed of awarding road projects was slow. I assure you we will finalise contracts worth more than Rs 3 lakh crore,ŌĆØ Road Transport and Highway Minister Gadkari said while speaking at the Network18 Chaupal on September 16. The minister added that India will see the highest highway construction in FY25. So far till August 31, 2024, MoRTH and the NHAI have awarded projects for around 700 kms while construction of 2,700 kms of national highways has been completed in FY25. This is much lower than the 3,200 kms of highways construction and 1,750 km of projects awarded during the same period in FY24. As part of the MoRTH's ministry's 100-day plan for the new government, the ministry has received approvals from the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs for the construction of eight new highway projects, Gadkari said. These eight projects include the construction of 88 km fully access- controlled 6-lane Agra-Gwalior corridor at a cost of Rs 4,613 crore under the buildŌĆōoperateŌĆōtransfer (BoT) model, construction of 231 km fully access- controlled 4-laned Kharagpur-Moregram corridor at a cost of Rs 10,247 crore under Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) mode, and development of 214 km fully access- controlled 6-lane Tharad-Deesa-Mehsana-Ahmedabad corridor at a cost of Rs 10,534 crore under the BoT model. Furthermore, the projects include the development of 68 km fully access- controlled 4-lane Ayodhya Ring Road at a cost of Rs 3,935 crore under HAM mode, construction of 137 km fully access- controlled 4 lane Pathalgaon-Gumla section of the Raipur- Ranchi Corridor at a cost of Rs 4,473 crore under HAM mode, construction of 47 km fully access- controlled 6-lane Kanpur Ring Road at a cost of Rs 3,298 crore under engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode, construction of 121 km Guwahati Ring Road at a cost of Rs 5,729 crore under BOT mode and construction of 30 km elevated Nashik Phata - Khed corridor at a cost of Rs 7,827 crore under BoT mode. Apart from the above MoRTH has also awarded the construction of 215 km of national highway at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore across Karnataka, Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The highway ministry also saw the operationalization of 219 km of High-Speed Corridors in India including the Santalpur ŌĆō Jalore section of the Amritsar- Jamnagar Corridor and Indergarh to Bridge on Mej River section of the Delhi Mumbai Expressway. As part of its original 100-day plan MoRTH had planned to operationalise 700 kilometres (km) of high-speed corridors, award 3,000 km of highway projects, and implement a scheme for cashless treatment for accident victims following the Lok Sabha elections. MoRTH had plans to construct over 1,700 km of highways in the first three months after elections and award over 3,000 km. The ministry had missed its original highway awarding target of nearly 13,000 km by a wide margin last financial year 2023-24, as it couldnŌĆÖt award projects due to delays in approval of the Revised Estimates of its flagship Bharatmala, the cost of which has doubled since its inception. Seven years after its launch in 2017, the government has restricted funding of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways' (MoRTH) flagship road construction scheme, the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The Bharatmala project, referred to as a garland of national highways, has been put into the cold storage on account of cost overruns and a seeming lack of consensus┬Āamong ministries. The central government has started discussions with the National Highways Authority of India's (NHAI) long-term bond holders for the prepayment of three NHAI bonds, a letter sent by the NHAI on August 11 to one of the bondholder banks, seen by Moneycontrol, says.

During the conclave, Gadkari made a statement that could pose a challenge to domestic airlines, but he also provided a solution for this potential issue.
Speaking about the new roads between key cities, Gadkari said, ""We are constructing a new road from Dehradun to Delhi, which will be completed by December 2024. People approach me to inquire about the tunnel route that will connect Dehradun to Mussoorie so they can buy homes there and settle down. They are willing to commute daily between Delhi and Mussoorie, as the travel time between Delhi and Dehradun will be reduced to around two hours. When we completed the Pune to Mumbai road, eight flights between the two cities were discontinued. After January 2025, flights from Delhi to Dehradun, Jaipur, and Chandigarh will likely be grounded due to better road connectivity.""

Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday favoured giving a majority 51 per cent stake to foreign partners in joint ventures for building tunnels and detailed project reports to improve work quality. Gadkari said providing a majority stake to a foreign partner in the joint venture is necessary to ensure that only serious and technically qualified players bid for tunnel projects.

This will be ramped up to a 6,000 by 2030, said Nitin Gadkari. ""The government is keen to have a gas economy in India, since it is more cost effective and less polluting,"" he added. Even methanol-blended diesel has been successfully implemented in some commericial vehicles by Ashok Leyland, which can now run on up to 15% methanol mixed in diesel. Minister Gadkari also asked truck makers to ramp up the manufacturing of liquefied natural gas based trucks.Â ""Will appeal truck makers to use ethanol, methanol, LNG and CNG."" Some reports have indicated that the Centre is keen to have as much as a third of its long-haul trucks fuelled by LNG, instead of diesel in five to seven years. A draft policy in this regard has been in the works at the Petroleum Ministry, which plans to allocate 0.5 million cubic metres of gas per day of LNG to meet the requirements of about 50,000 trucks for two-to-three years. ""In a gas economy compared to diesel, there is economic sense and saving. In single fill, LNG-powered trucks can go up to to 1400 km, and can result in a saving of Rs 12 lakh per year in fuel costs,"" Nitin Gadkari told car makers.

Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on September 9 said that a large Indian carmaker didn't take him seriously when he was pushing for developing more electric vehicles ingeniously in the past and now they may have missed the bus. ""A good friend of mine who is a giant in the automobile industry... I kept telling him to adopt electric vehicles, but he never made the decision,"" Gadkari said. ""Now, my friend tells me (that) back then we didn't take you seriously cause our experience related to politicians was not very credible."" The road minister added that he is confidant now that theÂ company has missed the bus.Â Gadkari was speaking at the 64th Annual Session of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA). He stressed that automobile companies that are willing to adopt the best technology in the world, which isÂ cost-saving and helps reduce pollution at a reasonable cost, will have a good future in the industry. While the road minister did not name Maruti Suzuki directly, his comments painted quite a clear picture. ""Those companies that currently have good sales, a good market cap, but don't want to change... I wish them all the best. I think they will face issues in the future,"" Gadkari said. The minister's comments come at a time when India's largest carmaker is doubling down on its stance on hybrid vehicles, insisting that strong hybrids should be considered as a replacement for petrol and diesel models, and not as a competitor to electric vehicles. Last month, in its annual report for 2023-24, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava had underscored the potential of a supportive policy framework in significantly reducing the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles, thereby curbing emissions. He pointed out that given Indiaâ€™s abundant resources and unique socio-economic conditions, a multifaceted approach is the most effective way forward. Maruti Suzuki plans to introduce electric cars soon, encouraging the adoption of strong hybrid technology, CNG, ethanol, and biogas vehicles. Bhargava emphasised the importance of renewable biogas, which has no import content and is carbon-negative. The company has started a trial of biogas production and hopes that government policies will support this development. The country's largest carmaker, which has historically made vehicles for the masses, is often questioned for not launching a fully electric vehicles till now, when the country records a sale of 6,338 electric vehicles in August 2024, and 1.5 million in 2023, at a 50 percent surge year-on-year. The overall share of EVs in India's auto sales has risen sharply to 6.38 percent in 2023 from 1.75 percent in 2021, reflecting a growing consumer preference for electric vehicles over a two-year period. Not only is Maruti Suzuki one of the few mass-market carmakers in India to offer a hybrid option, the brand is set to expand its petrol-electric portfolio, starting next year. ""The debate is not between EV and strong hybrid. Both are excellent technologies. Both need to be encouraged. The debate is between strong hybrids and IC engines. I cannot imagine a situation, and nobody can justify why IC engines should be preferred over strong hybrids,â€ť Maruti Suzukiâ€™s executive director, corporate affairs, Rahul Bharti, had insisted in June. He added that a recent report by a think tank, claiming that hybrids do not reduce emissions and that strong hybrids are mostly used in pure petrol mode, was factually incorrect. ""In a strong hybrid electric vehicle, it is the computer that optimises both drivetrains, the IC engine and the battery motor combination, and there is no option given to the driver to run in pure ICE mode,"" Bharti said. The executive director has also said that Marutiâ€™s Grand Vitara and Invicto hybrids produce 26 percent and 30 percent lower CO2, while increasing fuel-efficiency by 36 percent and 46 percent, compared to their petrol counterparts. â€śSo, definitely strong hybrids are a very powerful way to cut oil imports, generate energy efficiency, and reduce CO2 immediately without the pressure of range anxiety or lack of charging infrastructure,â€ť Bharti insisted. Maruti Suzuki's comments come at an important interjection for the electric vehicles industry in India, when the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme has been discontinued and electric passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales have declined for four months in a row.

On Tuesday, he also urged manufacturers to establish driving schools to ensure that those in control of automobiles are aware of local rules and regulations, as well as skilled to be driving or riding vehicles. “There are nearly 53 accidents and 18 deaths every hour in our country. Just imagine. 45 per cent of accidents because of two-wheelers, 20 per cent in pedestrians,” he pointed out before urging OEMs to also contribute towards bringing these numbers down. “I really request you all to take interest in starting driver-training schools. Then we can train good drivers and it can be a really positive solution.” Gadkari, while also admitting that his department has started working on faulty road constructions and signage, further underlined the need for safer vehicles and highlighted the importance of Bharat NCAP. “Bharat NCAP will ensure healthy competition between manufacturers to have safer vehicles for customers.” New Delhi: OpenAI, the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence firm, is once again drawing attention due to major...

 9/6/2024: NDTV reports that a third term for Nitin Gadkari is assured, as his capabilities are required to continue the infrastructure progress India has made in the last ten years. Along with important portfolios like Finance  and Home, this is one portfolio that is likely to remain with BJP. Four days after Lok Sabha elections and things are still in flux. Indian Politician Nitin Gadkari is one of the veteran members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has made a big name for himself as a senior union minister. He has served as the Minister of Road Transport and Highways in India for the past decade. Under his leadership, India’s infrastructure, particularly in terms of road and highway development, has seen significant changes. At present, there is uncertainty in the air as to who will become the next Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways. But before talking about that, let’s take a look at the good and bad bits of Mr. Gadkari’s 10 year tenure as MoRTH minister. First off, let’s start with the accomplishments of Mr. Gadkari as the Minister of Road Transport and Highways. One of Gadkari’s most notable contributions to the Indian automotive industry and car buyers has been his stance on safety. In his two terms as the MoRTH minister, he has focused on the implementation of stringent vehicle safety norms. He mandated the installation of Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS), speed alert systems, reverse parking sensors, and driver airbags in all vehicles. These measures over the years have significantly enhanced road safety. They have had a direct impact on reducing the number of accidents and fatalities. Gadkari has also been instrumental in pushing for the wide adoption of electric cars. Personally, he is also fascinated by Hydrogen cars and had a Toyota Mirai for a while. In the recent past, he expressed his desire that even hybrid cars should be taxed at a low GST rate – something that would have brought down the prices of Honda City hybrid, Maruti Grand Vitara and Toyota Hyryder, Hycross and Maruti Invicto. This proposal, however, was rejected by the Finance Ministry. Another big achievement of Nitin Gadkari is the introduction of the Fastag system. This system helped in streamlining toll collection across highways. It has helped in reducing traffic congestion and promoting efficient fuel use, along with ease of travel. Additionally, he also implemented the transition to BS6 emission standards. Under his leadership, this transition has been very pivotal in reducing vehicular pollution. This, in turn, has contributed to cleaner air in urban areas. In addition to mandating the installation of two airbags in all new cars sold after April 2021, Nitin Gadkari also announced that he would be increasing passenger safety by making six airbags mandatory in all vehicles. However, this rule received a lot of backlash from the automotive industry. Thankfully, now we are slowly seeing automakers implementing this safety feature by themselves. Following the tragic accident involving Cyrus Mistry, Nitin Gadkari also made rear seatbelt use compulsory. He emphasized that it is extremely important for the safety of all passengers. He highlighted that it is not just those in the front seats that should wear seatbelts; rather, everyone should be belted at any given time. To curb the increasing pollution levels in the country, Gadkari has been relentlessly promoting alternative fuels. He has pushed for higher ethanol blending in petrol. This is expected to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions. Apart from this, he has been a huge advocate for green hydrogen as a future fuel. He stated that it aligns with global trends towards sustainable energy sources. The former MoRTH minister also proposed tax breaks for hybrid cars. He stated that this could make these environmentally friendly vehicles more affordable for the average consumer. Another one of his greatest contributions has been a steep increase in fines for road offenses. To help in reducing traffic violations and enhancing road discipline, Gadkari’s ministry introduced steep increases in fines for various road offenses. This move helped in reducing reckless driving and ensuring better compliance with traffic regulations. No human is perfect, and everyone has done and said some questionable things. Nitin Gadkari, despite being right on many occasions, has been wrong at some as well. Here are the controversial statements he has made over the years. One of Gadkari’s biggest claims was his declaration to ban petrol and diesel vehicles by 2024. While this announcement highlighted his commitment to green energy, it has been widely criticized as unrealistic. This is because, given India’s current infrastructure and readiness for such a transition, it seems extremely far-fetched to achieve this target. Gadkari has often stated his ambition to develop Indian highways to match the standards of those in the United States. Now, this is a very good and ambitious goal, and significant improvements have been made. It has to be noted that achieving such a benchmark remains a distant goal. This is due to the vast differences in scale, resources, and existing infrastructure between the two countries. Gadkari has also taken a strong stance against the introduction of driverless cars in India. He has on numerous occasions cited that it could cause the potential loss of jobs for millions of drivers. This conservative view has sparked debates in the country. Mr. Gadkari was famously quoted as saying that he would bring a law that would mandate that all automotive horns sound like musical instruments. Nitin Gadkari has frequently accused the media of misquoting him or taking his statements out of context. He has, on many occasions, threatened legal action against those he claimed were distorting his words for political advancements. As Gadkari’s decade-long tenure as the MoRTH minister has approached its end, there is an uncertainty if he would be given this position again. Numerous people are speculating that he might not become the MoRTH minister once again. The primary reason behind this is that in the recent elections, BJP failed to achieve the majority number of seats required to form the government. It is now relying on its NDA alliance partners to form the government. As a trade-off, BJP could now be handing over a few of the important ministerial positions to its alliance partners Janata Dal (United) (JDU) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). This uncertainty extends to the broader political scenario, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s return not guaranteed. So at this moment, it has become a challenge to predict who will take up the position of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways next."

The minister's comments come at a time when India's largest carmaker is doubling down on its stance on hybrid vehicles, insisting that strong hybrids should be considered as a replacement for petrol and diesel models, and not as a competitor to electric vehicles. Last month, in its annual report for 2023-24, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava had underscored the potential of a supportive policy framework in significantly reducing the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles, thereby curbing emissions. He pointed out that given Indiaâ€™s abundant resources and unique socio-economic conditions, a multifaceted approach is the most effective way forward. Maruti Suzuki plans to introduce electric cars soon, encouraging the adoption of strong hybrid technology, CNG, ethanol, and biogas vehicles. Bhargava emphasised the importance of renewable biogas, which has no import content and is carbon-negative. The company has started a trial of biogas production and hopes that government policies will support this development. The country's largest carmaker, which has historically made vehicles for the masses, is often questioned for not launching a fully electric vehicles till now, when the country records a sale of 6,338 electric vehicles in August 2024, and 1.5 million in 2023, at a 50 percent surge year-on-year. The overall share of EVs in India's auto sales has risen sharply to 6.38 percent in 2023 from 1.75 percent in 2021, reflecting a growing consumer preference for electric vehicles over a two-year period. Not only is Maruti Suzuki one of the few mass-market carmakers in India to offer a hybrid option, the brand is set to expand its petrol-electric portfolio, starting next year. ""The debate is not between EV and strong hybrid. Both are excellent technologies. Both need to be encouraged. The debate is between strong hybrids and IC engines. I cannot imagine a situation, and nobody can justify why IC engines should be preferred over strong hybrids,â€ť Maruti Suzukiâ€™s executive director, corporate affairs, Rahul Bharti, had insisted in June. He added that a recent report by a think tank, claiming that hybrids do not reduce emissions and that strong hybrids are mostly used in pure petrol mode, was factually incorrect. ""In a strong hybrid electric vehicle, it is the computer that optimises both drivetrains, the IC engine and the battery motor combination, and there is no option given to the driver to run in pure ICE mode,"" Bharti said. The executive director has also said that Marutiâ€™s Grand Vitara and Invicto hybrids produce 26 percent and 30 percent lower CO2, while increasing fuel-efficiency by 36 percent and 46 percent, compared to their petrol counterparts. â€śSo, definitely strong hybrids are a very powerful way to cut oil imports, generate energy efficiency, and reduce CO2 immediately without the pressure of range anxiety or lack of charging infrastructure,â€ť Bharti insisted. Maruti Suzuki's comments come at an important interjection for the electric vehicles industry in India, when the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme has been discontinued and electric passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales have declined for four months in a row.
