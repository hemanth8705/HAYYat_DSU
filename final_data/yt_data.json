                "John 14:6 NKJV\r\n6 Jesus said to him, \u201cI am (A)the way, (B)the truth, and (C)the life. (D)No one comes to the Father (E)except through Me.\r\n\r\n*Did you know you\u2019re part of the ultimate statistics, 10 out of 10 people die. One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you\u2019ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You\u2019ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\r\n\r\n*Let\u2019s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a \u201cwhite\u201d lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sin, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the graves after three days  \u2013 defeating death. (Luke 24:46-48)\r\n\r\nRepent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don\u2019t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.\r\n\r\nDo you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.\r\n\r\n. Read the Bible to learn about God and how to live. (Acts 20:21) \r\n\r\n*Do God\u2019s will, plan and purpose in your life; these are above and beyond, immeasurable compare to your grandest dream.\r\n\r\n* We obey God\u2019s moral law the Ten Commandments because we love our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost(John 14:15) (John 14:1-6) (John 14:16-26) (Mark 12:30-31)  with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength, and we believe and have faith in Him; also we Fear Him with reverence with deep respect. \r\n\r\nJob 28:28\r\nKing James Version\r\n28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10\r\nNew King James Version\r\n9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes 12:13-14\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:\r\n\r\n(A)Fear God and keep His commandments,\r\nFor this is man\u2019s all.\r\n14 For (B)God will bring every work into judgment,\r\nIncluding every secret thing,\r\nWhether good or evil.\r\n\r\n* Let\u2019s seek the Lord and His face also His strength, power, wisdom and discernment in our daily lives.\r\n\r\nWe need God\u2019s help to overcome Sin in our lives. And live a holy life in the eyes of the Living God. \r\n\r\nGod will help us if we seek Him diligently with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength .\r\n\r\nPut on always the full armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\r\n\r\nPhilippians 4:13\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 I can do all things (A)through [a]Christ who strengthens me.\r\n\r\nPsalm 28:7\r\nNew King James Version\r\n7 The Lord is (A)my strength and my shield;\r\nMy heart (B)trusted in Him, and I am helped;\r\nTherefore my heart greatly rejoices,\r\nAnd with my song I will praise Him.\r\n\r\nActs 20:21\r\nKing James Version\r\n21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nGod bless.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving water.",

Well, guys, it's an exciting\ntime to be in New York City because over 140 world leaders just arrived here\nfor the UN General Assembly. -[ Cheers and applause ]\n-Yeah. Yeah. If you love the sound\nof car horns, police sirens, and New Yorkers\ncursing at motorcades, this is the week for you! Yes! [ Cheers and applause ] Yep, due to heavy traffic, all New Yorkers\nare being encouraged to take public transit. So instead of sitting\nin a car that's not moving, now you can sit on a train\nthat's not moving, so... Well, New York City officials\nactually said drivers should expect\nthe slowest traffic of the year. Yeah, you know, traffic is slow\nwhen even Biden is like, \"You know what? I'm just\ngonna get out and walk.\" Uh... [ Laughter ] Yeah, earlier today,\nPresident Biden attended the General Assembly and delivered\nhis final U.N. address. Biden called on nations to band\ntogether amid world conflicts and growing concerns\nover China's influence. Then he added,\n\"Or do whatever you want. What the hell do I care?\nI don't... I don't care anymore.\" Biden's address was a big deal. It's the most important speech\nhe's delivered in front of a 1990s\nkitchen backsplash. [ Laughter ] \u266a\u266a That's a home-improvement\nHGTV joke. Yeah. Some more political news. A new poll found\nthat 64% of people want to see another debate between Kamala Harris\nand Donald Trump... while the other 36%\nare Donald Trump. [ Laughter ] [ Applause ] [as Trump]\n\"I'm good. I'm totally good. No, thanks!\" Yep, Harris agreed\nto a second debate, but Trump's excuse\nwas that since early voting has already started,\nit's too late. Well, it turns out Trump is\nusing a special excuse generator to help him\nget out of these things. Let me show you how it works. When asked if he'd do a second\ndebate with Kamala Harris, Trump said... [ Beeping ] See? So...\nIt works like that. So then he tried another excuse.\nHe said... [ Beeping ] [ Laughter ] He got out of it. After that, Trump said... [ Beeping ] You know, that's... I mean, we need -- This is\nthe time of year to do it. Here's another one. He said... [ Beeping ] And finally, Trump said... [ Beeping ] And so he just has\na lot of excuses. He's busy. [ Applause ] Well, some news\nfrom Washington today. The CEO of the company\nthat makes Ozempic testified before Congress, and he was grilled\nover the drug's high price. Yeah, they were gonna roast him,\nbut grilling is healthier. [ Laughter ] \u266a\u266a Some more business news. Southwest Airlines\ntold its staff that the company will have to\nmake \"difficult decisions\" to boost profits. Yeah, today the CEO walked\ninto the cockpit and said, \"Sorry, guys.\nIt's your last day.\" And the pilots were like, \"That's okay.\nWe don't work here.\" [ Laughter ] Well, listen to this.\nI read that California is suing ExxonMobil\nfor allegedly not recycling\n95% of their plastic waste. -Ooh.\n-That just makes me sick. I mean, if you can't trust\na big oil company to protect the environment,\nthen who can you trust? You know what I'm saying?\nCome on, man. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Chuckles ] Some entertainment news.\nKevin Costner just hinted that he might return\nto \"Yellowstone.\" -Ooh. Ohh!\n-Yeah. Costner may have finally made up\nwith the show's creator. When they heard,\nthe United Nations was like, \"Well, our work here is done.\nTake care, everybody.\" Well, get this.\nAccording to a new survey, two out of five Gen Z men don't\nhave a primary care doctor. Instead, they just create\nthe hashtag #DoesThisLookInfected. [ Laughter ] Well, this is wild. I saw\nthat a cream-cheese festival in New York just served\nthe world's largest cheesecake at 15,000 pounds. [ Audience oohs ] 15,000 pounds of cheesecake, which is almost as heavy as the\nmenu at the Cheesecake Factory. Almost. Finally, guys, it is Tuesday. It's time for \"WePost.\"\nHere we go! -\u266a WePost \u266a \u266a WePost \u266a -Welcome to \"WePost.\" This is where we as a group\ndecide something we should post on socials.

This next one's not bad. -Okay.\n-This one's got a chance. -Really?\n-This one's got a chance\nto beat the other. The other one's pretty good,\nthough. Everyone can relate\nto that thing, sitting next to the weird person, yeah,\nbut this one's decent. Okay, here. This one says... [ Laughter ] -Whoa-oa-oa! -You go, \"Hey, how's it going?\nWhoa! Oh, my goodness. Sorry.\nWow. This is great. Where'd you get this thing?\" Alright, let's see\nthe results on this one. Can it beat 190? I don't know. -Oh, my gosh! Oh!\n-By one? Oh, my gosh!

After Trump\u2019s tariffs aimed at China in early 2018, retaliation from the country and other nations affected hit the U.S. economy and especially agricultural producers hard.\u00a0A report from the USDA shows\u00a0that between mid-2018 and the end of 2019, more than $27 billion, thereof $25.7 billion tied to China, had to be compensated with government payments to farmers. Tariff rates never exceeded 30 percent of goods value in that time period and were as low as 7.5 percent for some products, so an even higher and uniform tariff rate of 60 percent would be sure to send another shock wave through the U.S. business and farming communities.\n\nThank for destroy our food supply!!

                "By Hook Or By Crook\n\nMost folks adhere to some form of moral standard. For some, this standard may be based on a religious or political belief. For others, this standard may simply be based on some form of acceptable social ethics. But some folks\u2019 standards are not based on religion or politics or any form of acceptable ethics. Some folks\u2019 moral standard is based on the adage, \u2018by hook or crook.\u2019 Which means \u2018by any means necessary.\u2019\nThis standard has been followed by pirates, gangsters, con artists, grifters, and thieves, of all stripes, since time immemorial. Those who follow it have been the bane of law-abiding, God-fearing, and morally upstanding people since people first formed into social groups. They have been feared, despised, hated, loved, admired, and emulated. They fill our police blotters, pulp fiction, action movies, and news broadcasts. They walk the streets of the hood, they haunt the halls of Congress, and they inhabit the boardrooms of big business. They may be your co-worker, next-door neighbor, or even a family member.\nIt is hard to say what kind of child, or when and how a child will pick up this standard of behavior. For some, it may be due to a form of trauma. For others, it may be due to how they are raised. For many, it is probably a combination of both. Donald Trump was raised by his father with this standard, and he, in turn, raised his children in the same way. His father taught him that the only thing that matters is winning and to win one has to be a killer. In other words, one has to win \u2018by hook or by crook.\u2019\nWhat does this mean? It means that all other standards of behavior, be they religious, political, or ethical in any socially acceptable way, are secondary. It implies that honesty, fairness, and compassion are seen as signs of weakness, while dishonesty, double-dealing, and cold-heartedness are seen as signs of strength.\nIn the world of the pirate, gangster, con artist, grifter, and thief, to outsmart, con, take, buffalo, hoodwink, or rip off the common citizen, mark, John, or sucker is not only a sign of success but confirmation of one\u2019s superiority over the ordinary human being. Because at the core of a criminal\u2019s cynical rationalizations and justifications for doing what they do is a belief that the ordinary human being is stupid and the moral beliefs and standards of ordinary human beings are foolish. And so, ordinary human beings deserve what they get.\nDonald Trump and his family carried these cynical rationalizations and justifications of the common criminal into their adult lives and the White House of the United States. And they succeeded, with the help of corrupt politicians, disgruntled Americans, and a foreign government, in pulling off one of the greatest political cons, economic heists, and social grifts in human history. The American People, the American economy, and the American political system were held hostage by a virtual gang of pirates who were busy ransacking the coffers of the American government and wrecking the American ship of state for as long as they could get away with it.\nBut finally, with the 2020 election, the American people woke up to what had happened, mustered all of the weapons the electoral system had to offer, and launched a full-frontal assault on these marauders that successfully drove them out of the White House.\nBut now, after the attack on our Capitol building by Trump supporters, the ending of Roe by Trump appointees to the Supreme Court, and with Trump running for the White House again, we must continue to resist, first by voting, then by continuing the Trump indictments. We must drive him and his sycophants out of government entirely because these pirates, gangsters, con artists, grifters, and thieves care nothing for the standards of our representative democracy that we value. They do not care about democracy and they have no business being involved in the management of our government. They will continue to ignore the rule of law and seek to satisfy their insatiable and prideful need to win \u2018by hook or by crook\u2019. And they will destroy our constitutional republic in the process if we let them. We must not let them.\n\nJRB",

        "srt":"Andrew. Thank you. Well, former President Trump has announced possible plans to hit John Deere with tariffs on Monday. Trump told a group of farmers deer could face major tariffs if the company outsources jobs to Mexico. I I just noticed behind me, John Deere tractors, I know a lot about John Deere. I love the company, but, uh, as you know, they've announced a few days ago that they're gonna move a lot of their manufacturing business to Mexico. I'm just, uh, notifying John Deere right now. If you do that, we're putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States. So that if I win, John Deere is going to be paying a 200%. John Deere has directed questions about the announcement to a page on its website with the title John Deere's commitment to us manufacturing. Now, it says in order you see on your screen, in order to position our US factories to undertake these highly value additive activities, it is sometimes it is necessary to move less complex operations such as C assembly to other locations. This includes moving the production of some models of our skid steer loaders and compact loaders to our factory in Mexico, a facility that has been an important part of our global operation for nearly 70 years.

        "srt":">>> DONALD TRUMP IS HAVING A >>> DONALD TRUMP IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME WINNING OVER WOMEN. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST NBC'S NEWS POLLING, KAMALA HARRIS HOLDS A 21 POINT ADVANTAGE OVER TRUMP WITH FEMALE VOTERS. TRUMP IS ALSO DOWN 21 POINTS ON A KEY ISSUE THAT MATTERS TO A LOT OF AMERICAN WOMEN AND MEN AS WELL. 54% SAY KAMALA HARRIS WOULD BE BETTER THAN TRUMP ON ABORTION RIGHTS. NOW THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS TRYING TO BRIDGE THIS VERY SERIOUS GULF BY BASICALLY TELLING WOMEN -- >> WE HAVE TO END THIS NATIONAL NIGHTMARE. BECAUSE I AM YOUR PROTECTOR. I WANT TO BE YOUR PROTECTOR. AS PRESIDENT I HAVE TO BE YOUR PROTECTOR. YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABANDONED, LONELY OR SCARED. YOU WILL NO LONGER BE IN DANGER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN DANGER ANY LONGER. YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANXIETY FROM ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OUR COUNTRY HAS TODAY. WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE. YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION. IT IS ALL THEY TALK ABOUT, ABORTION. >> JOINING ME NOW IS SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, DEMOCRAT OF MASSACHUSETTS. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. >> GOOD TO BE HERE. >> WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PITCH THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE YOUR PROTECTOR AND HE IS TALKING TO YOU AS AN AMERICAN WOMAN AND HE WILL PROTECT YOU SO WELL THAT YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS POLITICS STUFF, LIKE ABORTION. >> THIS IS REALLY CREEPY. REALLY. THIS IS JUST CREEPY. THIS HAS THIS, YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY DOING EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS EXTREMIST FRIENDS HAVE DECIDED THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO. AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY IT ACTUALLY FITS WITH THE WHOLE MINDSET OF SAYING DONALD TRUMP AND AN EXTREMIST BRANCH IN THIS COUNTRY WILL DECIDE WHO GETS ACCESS TO ABORTION, IVF, CONTRACEPTION. IT IS THIS, THEY WILL MAKE THE DECISIONS AND WOMEN, BLESS US, WILL SIMPLY SAY THANK YOU AND BE SO HAPPY ABOUT ALL OF IT. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE ADVICE. THAT IS NOT HOW WE WORK. WOMEN ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS AND IF WE CONSULT PEOPLE, WE WOULD LIKE TO BE THE ONES WHO DECIDE WHO WE CONSULT. THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REALLY IT IS DONALD TRUMP AND A HANDFUL OF EXTREMISTS, COME IN AND DECIDE HEALTHCARE DECISIONS AND WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL CARE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. IT IS. IT IS JUST CREEPY, CHRIS. >> ANTHONY COMSTOCK, AFTER WHOM THE COMSTOCK ACT IS NAMED SAW HIMSELF ALSO AS A PROTECTOR OF WOMEN. THAT LAW WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY STILL ON THE BOOKS AND THANKS TO TRUMP'S COURT COULD BE UTILIZED BY A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON DAY ONE AS THEY CALL FOR IN PROJECT 2025 TO CRIMINALIZE ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION BEING MAILED ANYWHERE ON THE FIRST DAY. >> EXACT RIGHT AND REMEMBER J.D. VANCE HAS ALREADY WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TELLING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO GET OUT AND ENFORCE THE COMSTOCK ACT AND TAKE AWAY ACCESS TO ABORTION TO EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. NO MORE ACCESS AT ALL AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE REMINDER, OBVIOUSLY, WHY WE NEED KAMALA HARRIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT ALSO WHY WE NEED DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF CONGRESS AND\nPARTICULARLY DEMOCRATIC CONTROL PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE SENATE. YOU'RE COVERING THE RACES HERE AND I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE ABOUT THIS, BUT THIS IS REALLY THE MOMENT. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY WHERE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE STANDING UP AND SAYING I CARE ABOUT THE ABORTION ISSUE. I CARE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE MY DECISION OR LETTING WOMEN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS. THIS WILL BE ON THE BALLOT IN FLORIDA AND IT MEANS IF THAT SENATE RACE IS INDIRECT CONTENTION. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RACE THAT YOU WANT TO SAY WHERE IS A POSSIBLE PICKUP FOR DEMOCRATS? IT WILL BE IN A PLACE LIKE FLORIDA WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE POLLS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE, TO SAY WE WANT ACCESS TO ABORTION AND WHILE WE ARE HERE, WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO ACTUALLY WOULD HELP KAMALA HARRIS PUT A WALL IN PLACE THAT MAKE SURE THERE IS NO COMSTOCK ACT AND THAT SOME REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT ON HIS OWN IN THE FUTURE CANNOT JUST WAVE HIS WAND AND GET RID OF ACCESS TO ABORTION. >> I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT SENATE CANDIDATE BERNIE MORENO, RUNNING AGAINST HER COLLEAGUE IN OHIO AND HE SAID THIS AT A TOWN HALL WHICH I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, WHICH I THINK IS ACTUALLY WIDELY SHARED AMONG REPUBLICANS, WHICH IS HEAD-SCRATCHING, LIKE WHAT IS UP WITH THE OBSESSION WITH THE ABORTION THING? WHY DO THEY CARE SO MUCH? HE DOES NOT QUITE GET WHY WOMEN OVER 50 CARE ABOUT THE ISSUE. TAKE A LISTEN. >> SADLY BY THE WAY THERE ARE A LOT OF SUBURBAN WOMEN THAT ARE LIKE LISTEN, IF I CAN'T HAVE AN ABORTION WHENEVER I WANT, I WILL VOTE FOR ANYBODY ELSE, OKAY? HOLD ON. ESPECIALLY WOMEN THAT ARE LIKE PAST 50. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ONE? >> SO, THIS IS THE PLAN TO WIN VOTES FROM WOMEN? LOOK, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE PEOPLE OF OHIO HAVE SPOKEN ON THE QUESTION OF ABORTION AND THEY VOTED ON THIS LAST YEAR AND CAME TOGETHER AND SAID BY A PRETTY LARGE MAJORITY THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO ABORTION AND THAT THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS PATH OF HAVING THE GOVERNMENT MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM. BUT TO ME, THIS IS ALL THE SAME MINDSET ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP JUST SAYING THAT THEY ARE THE ONES GOING TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND PATTING SWEET LITTLE WOMEN ON THE HEAD AND TELLING US WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY DECIDE. NEWSFLASH. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH IT AT ALL. THAT IS WHY I THINK WE ARE BACKING UP KAMALA HARRIS AND BACKING UP DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND BACKING UP DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, BECAUSE THAT COMBINATION IS LITERALLY THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY THAT WE CAN PROTECT ACCESS TO ABORTION. PROTECT ACCESS TO IVF, ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SO, YES, YES, YES, WE HAVE TO HELP KAMALA HARRIS, BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO HELP REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE. FLORIDA MAYBE A PICKUP OPPORTUNITY. TEXAS IS LOOKING LIKE A PICKUP OPPORTUNITY AND DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRATS WHO ARE FIGHTING RIGHT NOW TO HANG ONTO THEIR SENATE SEATS. THAT IS OUR PATHWAY TO PROTECT ACCESS TO ABORTION IN RED STATES AND BLUE STATES, BECAUSE THOSE REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING IT CLEAR THEY ARE COMING FOR EVERYBODY. THEY WANT TO BAN ABORTION NATIONWIDE. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO FIGHT BACK. >> AS YOU KNOW, COLIN ALLRED IS A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN ",
