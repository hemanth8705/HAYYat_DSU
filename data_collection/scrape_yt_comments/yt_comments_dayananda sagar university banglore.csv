J-MScf76CK0,@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 tq for the suggestion
J-MScf76CK0,"@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 No, I've heard Ramaiah name more"
J-MScf76CK0,"@@Aryan_Kashyap well different people have different perspective
But both colleges are of same level"
J-MScf76CK0,"@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 I too think, both r of same lvl only 😂"
J-MScf76CK0,stupid to compare just see the branch you are getting better  branch is better for you id say

J-MScf76CK0,bmsce
J-MScf76CK0,@@mohit5709 how
J-MScf76CK0,@@mohit5709 same query
J-MScf76CK0,Ramaiah is more famous name wise
J-MScf76CK0,@@Shraddhaz_Guitar_Vibes look bmsce is present in heart of banglore and it is flexible to commute....placements are more or less same in both the colleges but bmsce unlike ramaiah stresses on more cirrcular and extra cirrcular activities...ramaiah is also a great college its ur opinion actually
