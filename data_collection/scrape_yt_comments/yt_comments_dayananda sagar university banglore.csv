J-MScf76CK0,Is bmsce a strict college?
J-MScf76CK0,The college is Pretty chill
J-MScf76CK0,Brother how is mechanical engineering in bmsce please say me it will be helpfull ....
J-MScf76CK0,"The placements for mechanical engineering in almost any college won't be good!
So u need to make sure to learn to code and learn about some basics of computers ( Networks, OS etc)  so that you can compete with the tech people."
J-MScf76CK0,@@RevRecords27 thank you ...üôè
J-MScf76CK0,Amazing and helpful.

J-MScf76CK0,Bhyia what is the hostel fees in BMSCE?
J-MScf76CK0,"It is around 2 lakhs per annum as per my knowledge!
Make sure to check it once"
J-MScf76CK0,‚Äã@@RevRecords27bhyia is this the cheapest? Don't they have 2-3 sharing room? Bhyia It's quite expensive
J-MScf76CK0,Which is best bms or msrit?
J-MScf76CK0,Did u got ur answer ??
J-MScf76CK0,"@@Aryan_Kashyap not yet, tell me if u know"
J-MScf76CK0,"@@awesome8680 I'm preferring Ramaiah
Actually, in 2022 the placement of Ramaiah wasn't great & avg dropped that y many r opting for BMSCE"
J-MScf76CK0,@@awesome8680 but tbh both r at same lvl
J-MScf76CK0,@@Aryan_Kashyap ok
J-MScf76CK0,BMSCE has more reputation in the industry
J-MScf76CK0,@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 tq for the suggestion
J-MScf76CK0,"@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 No, I've heard Ramaiah name more"
J-MScf76CK0,"@@Aryan_Kashyap well different people have different perspective
But both colleges are of same level"
J-MScf76CK0,"@@prabhanjanpbhat2834 I too think, both r of same lvl only üòÇ"
J-MScf76CK0,stupid to compare just see the branch you are getting better  branch is better for you id say
J-MScf76CK0,It will be more helpful if you mention the fee structure and hostel fees
J-MScf76CK0,"Sure!

J-MScf76CK0,Which is best for placements msrit or bmsce ???
J-MScf76CK0,bmsce
J-MScf76CK0,@@mohit5709 how
J-MScf76CK0,@@mohit5709 same query
J-MScf76CK0,Ramaiah is more famous name wise
J-MScf76CK0,@@Shraddhaz_Guitar_Vibes look bmsce is present in heart of banglore and it is flexible to commute....placements are more or less same in both the colleges but bmsce unlike ramaiah stresses on more cirrcular and extra cirrcular activities...ramaiah is also a great college its ur opinion actually
J-MScf76CK0,BMSCE is more reputed than MSRIT
J-MScf76CK0,thank you
J-MScf76CK0,I hope the video helped you!
