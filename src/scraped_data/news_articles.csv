0,Nikhil Kamath fears new F&O rules to affect Zerodha profits by 30-50%,https://techstory.in/nikhil-kamath-fears-new-fo-rules-to-affect-zerodha-profits-by-30-50/,"Zerodha, the top discount brokerage company in India, keeps setting new records for success in the financial arena. The company’s revenue increased dramatically to ₹8,320 crore in the most recent fiscal year from ₹6,875 crore the year before. Its earnings increased in line with this, rising from ₹2,907 crore to ₹4,700 crore. Even if these figures are great, the company wants to diversify its business model in light of shifting regulatory environments. Let’s examine this change in more detail to see what it might mean for Zerodha and its clients. A major factor in Zerodha’s recent financial success has been the increase in the number of ordinary people investing in stocks. Over the past three years, the company has developed steadily, and as more retail traders join the market, demand for its services has increased. The CEO of Zerodha, Nithin Kamath, noted in a blog post that the company’s profit margin does not yet reflect ₹1,000 crore in unrealized profits; they would be included in the company’s upcoming financial filings. This would only increase the profitability of the business. Kamath further mentioned that Zerodha is currently among the safest brokers to trade with because its net worth is about 40% of the total amount of customer funds it manages. This gives Zerodha a strong financial buffer. Despite Zerodha’s explosive expansion, the company is currently dealing with growing regulatory scrutiny. New rules have been proposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) with the intention of lowering risks for individual traders. This covers a consultation paper on index derivatives as well as the true-to-label circular, which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2024. Zerodha believes that these rules will have a big effect on company business, especially in regards to trading in futures and options (F&O). As Kamath has already stated, the company may experience a 30–50% drop in revenue in the upcoming quarters if these regulations come into effect. This change has forced Zerodha to reconsider its approach and break from its substantial reliance on food and beverage, which has always been a significant source of income. Credits: The Financial Express Despite its profitability, the F&O industry has drawn criticism because of the risks that retail traders must take. In F&O trading, 93% of retail traders lose an average of ₹2 lakh apiece, according to SEBI. Acknowledging these dangers, Zerodha intends to diversify into other financial services markets and lessen its reliance on one particular segment. Kamath emphasized the need for Zerodha to pivot and focus on offering a broader range of investment options. The company is planning to launch several new services, including: Margin Trade Funding (MTF): This service will allow investors to borrow money to trade in the market, offering a way to increase returns on smaller investments. Public and Private Market Investments: Zerodha is looking to expand its offerings to include more diversified investment options, including private market opportunities through its initiative, @Rainmatterin. Loans Against Securities: This product will allow Zerodha’s clients to leverage their existing securities portfolio for loans, a service that will be offered through @ZerodhaCapital. Zerodha Asset Management: In a joint venture with Smallcase, Zerodha will introduce new investment products aimed at providing diversified and tailored portfolios for retail investors. Insurance Services: Zerodha will also expand into insurance through a partnership with @Finshots and its insurance JV, @joinditto. This diversified approach will allow Zerodha to cater to a wider range of customers, including those looking for lower-risk investments. By offering these additional services, the company hopes to mitigate the financial impact of regulatory changes in the F&O segment. Despite its remarkable financial results, Zerodha is not content to sit back and take it all in. with response to mounting regulatory pressure and the hazards involved with F&O trading, Zerodha is proactively changing its approach. In order to weather future problems and hold onto its market leadership, the corporation intends to expand its offers and shift toward less hazardous, more sustainable revenue streams. Despite potential obstacles, Zerodha’s innovative and diversified business model may guarantee its sustained success in India’s changing financial environment.

The profit, he added, doesn’t consider the Rs 1000 crore of unrealised gain, which will show in the company’s financials. For FY23, Zerodha had reported a 38.5 per cent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 6875 crore. Profit for the period was recorded at Rs 2907 crore, posting a growth of 39 per cent. “Given the profitability of the last three years, our net worth is almost ~40 per cent of the customer funds that we manage. It makes us one of the safest brokers to trade with,” Nithin Kamath said.  However, with many risks around the corner, Nithin Kamath said that the company is bracing for a big revenue hit later this year. He listed the following reasons that will impact the revenue numbers going forward: In addition to all of this, Nithin Kamath also talked about the risk of the bull market ending at any time, which can bring significant drawdowns. However, he added, “We are well covered to get over the lull period with a lean team, efficient expenses and infrastructure and material costs, and a strong net worth. Even today, the overall team size stands at 1200, with the core team responsible for running the business being a small fraction of it.” Zerodha’s active accounts and assets under custody In the blog post, Nithin Kamath said that a lot of the recent growth in new users has come from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Further, he added that the company’s total current assets under custody, i.e., the total assets held in demat accounts, stand at Rs 5.66 lakh crore. “By the way, this equals ten crore rows of holdings. The credit goes to the roaring bull market, massively increased retail participation, and a super hot IPO market, and the trust of our clients. The exciting bit about this number is that our customers as a whole are sitting on an unrealised profit of more than one lakh crore,” he said.  Dame Maggie Smith, a beloved figure in the world of stage and screen, has passed away, leaving behind a lasting impact on countless hearts.

5,Nikhil Kamath fears new F&O rules to affect Zerodha profits by 30-50%,https://techstory.in/nikhil-kamath-fears-new-fo-rules-to-affect-zerodha-profits-by-30-50/,"Zerodha, the top discount brokerage company in India, keeps setting new records for success in the financial arena.

6,Ather Energy’s Tarun Mehta Explains Why Battery Subscriptions Didn’t Work For them,https://www.cartoq.com/bike-news/ather-energy-tarun-mehta-battery-subscriptions/,"  Hyundai Grand i10 Nios     Maruti Suzuki Wagon R     Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara     Maruti Suzuki Alto K10     Maruti Suzuki Swift 2024     Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire     Written By:    Neeraj Padmakumar     Published: Sep 14, 2024, 11:36 IST   Updated: Sep 14, 2024, 11:36 IST
 Battery as a Service (BaaS) is being increasingly talked about these days. Many OEMs are trying out this new format. Ather Energy was one of the first to try their luck with BaaS, in India. It, however, did not go well for them. In a recent interview with Youtuber Nikhil Kamath, the founder Tarun Mehta explained why Ather failed with Battery as a service model. Tarun says at some point in time, his company reckoned the ongoing money drain and increasing losses. For Ather to spring back, they needed to make the scooter price 1.6 lakh. Previously, it had a price of 1.2 lakh. The CEO says that they launched the Ather 450X Apex STD for 1.6 lakh, and rolled out a battery subscription model as well. The subscription model would allow the vehicle to be purchased for Rs 90,000, and the rest be paid as a subscription fee for the battery pack. There are two plans available: Plus and Pro, priced at 1,699 and 1,999 respectively. These offer different performance levels and could also be switched between. Ather, as admitted by the founder previously, doesn’t believe in battery swapping due to the various infrastructure, labour and inventory limitations associated with it. So why did this model fail for the electric scooter manufacturer? Well, Tarun explains that they had to confront many complications with the model. People criticized them and expressed their dissatisfaction with getting batteries as a service for the electric scooters they paid for. Mehta’s confession says ‘ many people told him that their vehicles are deep emotional purchases for them, and they had to completely own them at some point in time.’ People were not OK with paying EMIs or rent for batteries of their newly bought electric scooters. In a way, it makes sense. Battery rentals on something like an electric scooter that costs just around a lakh, might make one feel like having to pay rent to stay in his own house. Ather could not convince the average Indian buyer to pay lifetime rent on battery packs. Leave scooters, subscription-based battery packs could work well for electric cars. If implemented, these could make electric cars a lot cheaper. The recently launched MG Windsor offers a similar model. Subscriptions could make prices fall to figures lower than the costs of CNG cars. EVs can then become more profitable alternatives to CNG cars, and will easily be hits in the fleet segment. Subscription-based electric cars could also find acceptance in the private passenger vehicle segment, for a selected set of potential owners. For people who change their cars every 3-4 years, and are on the lookout for a new electric car, the model could be of value. With significant cuts in price and additional value delivered by the piecemeal model, owners will incur less loss ( or more profit) while selling these. Another section of buyers who will benefit from the subscription arrangement is that of large companies that offer leased vehicles to their employees. These days, many MNCs and corporates offer such provisions. The arrangement will allow for easier and more cost-effective adoptions in such cases. In short, even though battery subscriptions may not be the most ideal for electric two-wheelers in the Indian market, it could make sense in electric cars. More EV car manufacturers are expected to join the party soon."
7,Nikhil Kamath Exploring Kriti Sanon’s ‘Attachment Style’ on Podcast Leaves Internet With Questions,https://www.news18.com/viral/nikhil-kamath-exploring-kriti-sanons-attachment-style-on-podcast-leaves-internet-puzzled-9028130.html,"Curated By:  Arfa Javaid Last Updated: August 26, 2024, 16:35 IST Kriti Sanon on Nikhil Kamath's latest podacst. (Pic credit: YouTube: Nikhil Kamath) Nikhil Kamath recently hosted actor Kriti Sanon, cricketer KL Rahul, and rapper-singer Badshah on his podcast “WTF is”. During the conversation, he explored what it takes to succeed in “offbeat careers”. Kamath questioned the trio, asking whether their success was due to sheer talent, the discipline to achieve excellence regardless of talent, or simply being in the right place at the right time – attributing it to good luck. Now, a clip of Kamath exploring Sanon’s “attachment style” during the show has gone viral on the Internet, leaving many with questions.  “This is psycho analysis and exploring  Kriti Sanon’s ‘attachment style’ in Nikhil Kamath’s podcast was so unnecessary. Either he’s flirting with her or he’s just trying to give her free therapy. He didn’t ask these questions to the other guests though,” reads the text to the video shared on X.  Kamath asks Sanon, “Are you the kind of baby when your mother walked into your room while you were crying and held you and you stopped crying immediately. Or are you the kind of baby when your mother came into the room and held you and you took a long time to stop crying. Or are you the kind of baby that when you mother came into the room, you were indifferent to her being in the room and you didn’t even cry and she left the room.” To this, Sanon replied, “No, I think out of the first or second. I mean I can if I am holding a lot inside, if at that point you know when someone touches you, you can sort of start crying. I can be that person.” Kamath then followed up, asking, “Can you stop crying?” “In some time. It’s not instant. If my mood is off, I usually don’t want people around me. I need to be left alone for some time. If I wanna talk and you’re there, I may start crying in front of you. And, if you scream at me, I will 100 per cent start crying.” The conversation continued with Kamath asking Sanon about the last time she lost her temper. Sanon shared, “I can sometimes snap. I used to be a lot more patient earlier. I think my patience over time has reduced  a little, no idea why. Maybe just the stress and a lot more happening in life. If somebody screams at me… it’s very difficult for me to give back at that moment.” This is psycho analysis and exploring Kriti Sanon’s ‘attachment style’ in Nikhil Kamath’s podcast was so unnecessary. Either he’s flirting with her or he’s just trying to give her free therapy‍♀️He didn’t ask these questions to the other guests though. pic.twitter.com/71G6XRmWjE — purpleready (@epicnephrin_e) August 25, 2024 The video, since being shared on August 25, has garnered more than one lakh views and the numbers are still increasing.

The duo was captured in several pictures and videos that surfaced on social media. In one of the videos shared by a paparazzo on Instagram, Rhea was seen riding pillion on Nikhil’s bike. For the outing, Rhea opted for a casual yet stylish look, wearing a cropped rust top under a denim jacket paired with purple pants. She accessorized with a mask, a bag, and sandals, and wore her hair in a ponytail. Notably, Rhea did not wear a helmet, which drew some attention and comments online. Nikhil, on the other hand, was dressed in a black jacket and shorts, and he wore both a face mask and a helmet while riding the bike. The video led to some online criticism, with users questioning why Rhea wasn’t wearing a helmet. Comments ranged from “Helmet? Any special rule for her?” to “Pillion rider doesn’t require a helmet?” indicating public concern over road safety regulations. Rhea Chakraborty has been working on rebuilding her life after facing intense scrutiny and legal troubles following the death of her boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajput, in 2020. Recently, Rhea made her podcast debut with Chapter 2, where she spoke about moving on and embracing new beginnings. She described her journey as a “rebirth” and emphasized the importance of starting anew in life. Following Sushant Singh Rajput’s tragic death in June 2020, Rhea was arrested in a drugs-related case linked to his demise. She was granted bail in October 2020, and earlier this year, a special court allowed her to travel abroad for a short holiday with her family. The case surrounding Sushant’s death, which was initially investigated by the Mumbai police as an Accidental Death Report (ADR), took a significant turn when Sushant’s father filed a complaint against Rhea and her family, accusing them of abetting his suicide. The investigation and the media coverage around it had a profound impact on Rhea’s life and career.
